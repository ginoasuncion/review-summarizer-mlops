rsj9LsiMUOE,Nike Dunk Panda,2021 the year of the dunk this is like the second pair i've hit in like a week so i mean that's pretty crazy now today's pair or today's colorway is something i'm actually very excited to take a look at so let's get straight into it today we're taking a look at the black and white nike dunk low [Applause] [Applause] so so here is the box the regular nike box so the regular box that all dunks are gonna come in and this is your size tag right there it literally just says black and white and that of course is the colorway we're taking a look at today so let's jump straight in wow yes clean as hell the nike dunk low black and white now here we go i mean i don't think you can get a more simple colorway than this this is going to be one of the most versatile options when it comes to the dumped look just very very basic black and white color blocking i'm really liking it thinking about it now i mean you don't often see such a simple black and white color on a pair of dunk i guess the only one that comes to mind right now is the ambush dunk high that we saw again that having the black and white color blocking but i mean i tell you what this is very simple but just looks really good now before we carry on you do need to know the release date on these because it's a little bit all over the place so essentially this released just after the four dunks that we received in january and of course those four dunks was the unlv the coast colorway and the two gray colored high versions now all of those released on january the 14th and this one was set a little bit apart releasing on january the 21st now why this is a little bit all over the place is because this one was pushed back out in the us along with pretty much all of the other dunks however this specific colorway you're going to have to wait all the way till march to you guys get this out in the us and of course these retail for the regular 90 pounds or a hundred dollars if you are out in the us now just like how i mentioned in the unlv review that i did this dunk is gonna be part of nike's i guess you could call it new strategy of just pumping out dunks so we're talking more availability more colorways more stock and just more retailers that are going to be releasing these so these were available through the nike app instead of the nike sneakers app like we were used to back in 2020 so you can expect your chances to move up just a little bit here in 2021 when it comes to grabbing yourself a pair of dunks you have to know these are in very high demand possibly even more than we saw in 2020. so if you manage to get them over here in the uk count yourself lucky and if you're out in the u.s waiting to get these make sure you're on your toes because these are going to fly especially this colorway it is very simple and man it looks good as hell on foot now one thing i do want to mention because i feel like you guys can really verify this for me and it's basically the quality control on these recent dunks i have had a few people mention to me that their pears just looked a little bit all over the place with glue stains and just some very odd imperfections and of course when you get a very mass-produced pair of shoes that is bound to happen i've got both of the pairs that i got off of the i guess 2021 dunk release now both of the ones that i've received do have slight imperfections and what you would call i guess quality control issues but you can see there is a lot of glue stains like specifically this one it reaches all the way up to the toe box and when i got this pair out it's pretty much the same deal now none of these imperfections are a complete deal breaker it's nothing that i'm crazy upset about i'm just saying if you guys also are experienced random quality control issues drop it down in the comment section because it is interesting to see if this is a widespread thing or hey maybe i just received two quality control issued pairs the leather quality is pretty nice it's definitely nothing insane and nothing that's gonna blow your mind but when it comes to that retail price i think it's definitely something you're not gonna be mad at this is my first black and white dunk or it's pretty much the most subtle or simple colorway that i've ever had in a pair of dunk loads obviously dunks are pretty hard to get so it's not like i've had a whole lot of opportunities but this is definitely something that quite surprised me putting it on and just really digging the color on foot this is a really nice colorway that i think will get a lot of wear and a lot of use this could be your next beater pair and something that you just kind of wear down so overall i think this is a fantastic colorway and obviously if you are out in the us you do have a decent amount of time to choose or kind of focus on which one you would like out of the plethora of dunks that have released thus far i think this one definitely stands to be one of the nicer pairs of dunks that i've seen what are we gonna call this the panda dunks is that a thing do people call this the panda colorway otherwise it's just the black and white i feel like we need a nickname for this one but either way let me know what you guys think about this colorway down in the comment section but that about wraps it up for the black and white nike dunk low thank you guys so much for coming through liking commenting and of course subscribing i will catch you all in the next one but until then you,2025-06-23 14:49:34.207771 UTC

e_disMbLMsQ,Adidas Samba,"Adidas sambas released for the first time ever in 1949 and designed by the founder himself of Adidas Adolf dasler it's been 74 or 75 years roughly since the release and this sneaker suddenly becomes a trend in 2023 what is so special about it so I'm going to share a lot of information related to this Adidas Samba unbox them review them genuinely help you decide if you should get this sneaker or not stay till the end because I'll be revealing the prices and what is the best price at which you can get this subscribe to the channel if you have not done yet because I keep dropping some regular sneaker videos I'm sure you don't want to miss that see you after this quick intro so going back in the history this sneaker was created actually by the founder himself Adolf dler in 1949 it was all black with the Brand's classic three stripes in white and a gum sole designed to enable soccer players to play on hard and icy surfaces but back then it wasn't Nam Samba or anything like that in fact in 1950 FIFA World Cup took place in Brazil and to step up the market game Adidas named the shoe Samba after a traditional Brazilian dance and music genre now fast forward to 2023 backed by meaningful collaborations and Renown celebrities like Frank Ocean Jonah Hill Bella Hadid and Kendall Jenner these people made the sambas even more appealing through their influence additionally these were also announced the sneer of the year in 2023 that surely pumped up the global acceptance so much so that sambas are high on demand high on Supply and it just isn't stopping multiple colorways and collaborations are hitting the shell and the pair is moving real fast in fact sambas are the second best selling design for Adidas selling over 35 million pairs till date this one that I'm showing in the video is Adidas Samba wegan and not Adidas Samba OG so there is going to be a difference in the material quality but this is just for representation purpose so please ignore that part now this sneaker's MRP is around 11,000 mark and it is almost available everywhere in India right from mintra tat click AIO naika limited edition Food Locker extra butter veg nonv and Super Kicks all are selling legit sambas but if you want a specific colorway or a collaboration that's not available in India you might have to get in touch with your plug who will Source this sneaker from abroad and you might have to pay anywhere between 15 to 20,000 for that specific colorway or collaboration Samba in fact some of the trusted resellers in India are selling this Adidas samb OG or samb wegan for anywhere between 8,000 to 9,000 that's a kickass deal but please beware while you deal with your reseller now as far as the review is concerned the sneaker is a very interesting looking clean pair with a white base some suede overlays around the toe and black stripes that represent Adidas you'll find a golden sambar written alongside the stripe the inner sole of the sneaker is pretty thin layer so it doesn't provide you any support and might get uncomfortable but I would recommend you to add some gel insole or a support insole to just add up to the cushioning level it's majorly made in Vietnam so nothing to worry about the quality aspect the outsole has a very good grip with these structures on the rear part and these air suction cups so I'm going to test the weight of the shoe just to to see how heavy or how light it is let me just remove all the stuffing inside and it is showing 0 g here it's right now 8 UK in my hand so I'm just going to keep this one shoe it's showing 280 G and that's actually a lightweight sneaker for a daily casual use overall I feel at this price point it's a must have sneaker if you're into collecting unique sneakers it gives you a good option to style up with baggy classic party outfits or just for casual outings seamlessly now a lot of people you'll see on the internet or in the sneaker industry say that this is the next Panda but I would differ here pandas actually had a very different run there were a specific colorway of a dunk silhouette whereas this is an OG silouette in itself by Adidas and stood the test of time and single-handedly beating Nike sneakers globally sambas will continue to remain classic for a very long time and will offer you that premium look no matter what if you're going for white sambas make sure that you keep them clean so that was a quick review of Adidas sambas I hope I have covered all the points I'll be mentioning more details in the description below so you should check check that out and I know I've come after a long time with this long format video but I'll be staying committed to this particular video format I've also dropped some viral shots in between please go and watch that on my channel and if you have not subscribed yet please do that we're aiming to build India's biggest YouTube channel and I need your support for that in fact Instagram P we have crossed 100,000 followers I'm leaving all the details in the description till my next video you guys stay fit and keep watching smart kicks",2025-06-19 08:41:02.009092 UTC
AOmp_71Vr7I,New Balance 990,Brad Hall here and right in front of me is a shoe that I've been looking forward to for a while now it's the New Balance 990 V6 the latest iteration of the classic 990 there are some really interesting updates to this model that I'm going to go over in just a little bit right ahead that is coming up soon so stick around the 990 has been one of my go-to shoes for the last few years a lot of that V4 a little bit of that V5 a decent amount of the V3 I just love grabbing them putting them on wearing them around they're very comfortable very easy to to tackle a day in them as you can see the V6 it's got that 990 DNA inside of it the upper got that mix of suede of mesh you've got some 3M in there there's that classic little bit of red it's still made in the US and it looks to be pretty well made nicely put together now this version does look a little more of the moment it's got a beefier midsole that seems in line with what those other running shoes are looking like I've seen people on the internet saying this is Hoka esque it's definitely got more body than the previous previous 990s but I wouldn't put this in Hoka territory I actually really like the way it looks I think it looks a lot better than the V5 midsole this one is a little bit curvier it's just got a nice shape some nice lines I like what they're doing with this midsole now probably the biggest change with this model is also a part of this midsole and it's the type of foam they used on this one you've got fuel cell so you can see it says fuel cell on the heel there this foam is used on a lot of their running shoes more performance-based it's supposed to be ultra responsive nicely cushioned the shoe feels lighter in hand I don't know if that's because there's a little less suede on the upper or if that is that fuel cell foam it does feel pretty nice just with my hand so I think it's going to feel even better when I get my foot in there that's what I always say right now I'd put it in the middle of the pack but it could go up the more I look at it and the more colorways that come out some of those colorways that have been teased the way the color was applied it transformed this shoe pretty dramatically and that's something you haven't really seen on the 990 in my opinion so curious to see what those other colorways are going to look like obviously looks are subjective maybe this model isn't the right gray New Balance model for you fortunately New Balance does make make at least 1 million other gray shoes so there's a little something for everyone now in terms of sizing I got my normal size I feel very content with that but they did feel a little bit long just with that initial Tryon I'll have to spend some time in them to see if that's going to be a problem maybe a half size down will be the way to go with this one but I always say a little bit bigger that's what I would rather have than a little too small a little too small that's just the worst so I don't feel bad about going with my normal size but I am going to do some more testing on that so those are my initial thoughts on the 990 V6 a shoe I've been very excited about for a while and I feel just as thrilled to have them in hand and I can't wait to start start putting the miles on them thanks everyone for watching,2025-06-23 14:42:45.857348 UTC

vpb2gKsNT04,Onitsuka Mexico 66,I have been waiting to review these for so long and now I finally have them for those of you who may never have seen these before these are the onita cut tiger Mexico 66 as you can see I went for the most vibrant pair I have seen these all over the Internet for the past year or so and obviously tennis shoes are very in Trend right now so I just had to pick these up and see what the hype is all about you may have not seen these on the internet before but you may have seen them from Kill Bill when the bride is fighting in her bright yellow and black tracksuit and of course she has a pair of these on that to match the brand onica Tiger has so much history behind it the brand was founded by the designer Mr onaka in 1949 who first began designing basketball shoes and he was determined to inspire positivity in the Youth of postwar Japan the brands attracted Phil Knight who is the founder of Nike back then it was actually known as Blue Ribbon which I can't get over imagine Nike now being called Blue Ribbon it just it doesn't make sense anyway Phil Knight went to visit Japan and he stumbled across onica tiger and he loved the design of these trainers so much that he decided to import them from Japan and sell them in America in fact the brand is celebrating its 75th Anniversary this year and guess where they are celebrating it they are celebrating in Paris Olympics which is just on brand and do you know what they're doing to celebrating it they opened up a hotel so the hotel is called obviously Onix hotel and of course the design of it is yellow and black the hotel looks insane and it's also got like a kind of Museum so you can go visit there's installations art installations there cafes things like that honestly if I was going to the Paris Olympics this year I would 100% be going there it just looks insane the brand was relaunched in 2002 and since then we have seen so many celebrities wearing these I actually saw a picture of Prince William wearing a pair of these of course it was not this color it was definitely a more kind of subtle color but still they are a very very popular sneaker these do retail at £130 I'm going to touch on pricing a little bit later down the line and give you my opinion on the price of these as I said earlier this shoe design is very on Trend at the moment you've got this low cut flexible thin sole design going on is a kind of like a tennis C shoe design it was originally designed as a running shoe so it was designed to be very practical it's also very very light on hand and of course it's probably going to be light on foot in terms of the design of the sneaker the main bulk of the upper is made up of this very soft and flexible leather and then on the toe box it is reinforced with suede on the side panels we do have the Striking contrasting black leather logos which do cross over on the back as well on the back you will notice that we do have this suede patch with the tiger logo which is a really nice extra feature as for the sole we do have a very thin sole with a white mid so the soes are so thin that it's basically like walking barefoot even though they were designed as a running shoes I would definitely not running them as they are too thin and they do not offer they're not going to give you that kind of foot or leg support that you need when you are running you do have to bear in mind I did read that as I mentioned before that these were designed for a running shoe and the athlete that he originally designed them for was a runner but that Runner used to wear baref fooot so that kind of all makes sense now because this is literally like a second a second skin on your foot in terms of sizing and comfortability I went for my normal true size size which is a size seven I did read up some reviews about these and some people are telling me to go size up um but I actually found that these fit perfectly true to size they do have a very slim fit though I must say in terms of my foot I feel like I have a very average I don't have a specifically wide foot or a specifically slim fit my foot's kind of average so I found these to fit quite comfortable actually I didn't find them too tight around my when I tried these on I was actually pleasantly surprised I thought because they had very thin sols that I was not going to get on with them they do have that arched inso which for me really helps because I do have flat feet um however I feel like I could not wear these you know 24/7 I feel like they do make good everyday shoes if you're just nipping to the shops nipping out for a coffee just going shopping they're very easy to get on they are very very light but I do feel like after a while because I do have flat feet the thin saws are probably going to be a problem but I know plenty of people that wear similar shoes like this as just their normal everyday shoe um that's just like a little personal preference for me they have been compared a lot to the sambas as they have the same kind of design however this does have a much much thinner sole personally for me I prefer something that is more unique so I would go for maybe this kind of style of design because at the moment sers have been one of those sneakers that has been absolutely plastered everywhere it was on you know a really really really big Trend possibly it still is so I feel like if I'm going to commit to a sneaker like this you know the lowart the flexibility the thin solve then I'm going to fully commit and go all out and I really feel like this is literally like a second skin it feels like you are walking bare feet although the sambers do have a price point of £70 which is quite a lot cheaper than these these are £130 I feel like £130 is really on that like sitting on the fence price it's not cheap whatsoever for such a simple shoe and it's also a little bit pricey that it makes it you know a little bit more bougie um which I guess that comes with a certain kind of look and feel for the shoe and certain image of the shoe is a bit more luxury but at the end of the day I do think that this is still kind of a classic everyday shoe it's not a designer shoe whatsoever but yeah that price point I feel like it's a little bit annoying like it's a little bit expensive but it's not at the same time I have read through a lot of review on these and people swear by them they do say that they are better by the sambers I feel like it's going to take a little while getting used to wearing such a thin shoe but I'm really excited to try it out please let me know in the comments below whether you guys have picked up any of these or you are going to pick them up and especially those of you who have had them for a long time what's the durability like I feel like because they are you know there's not that much material on there that they're not going to last you a really long time and people tend to use these as an everyday shoe however saying that I feel like these kind of shoes in the sers once they get battered they still look good they still fit that kind of aesthetic if you are not a fan of the yellow and black and I can totally understand that because these are a bold statement shoe then there are loads of different variations and colors to choose from if you wanted a more subtle pair personally for me I feel like because the design is so lowkey the Bold yellow and black goes really nicely thank you guys so much for watching today's video please do leave a comment below and let me know what you guys are saying about the Anica Tigers Mexico 66 really interested to see what you guys are feeling about these putting these on was actually such a strange experience for me because I feel like I haven't bought a pair of sneakers that are like this in such a long time because they are literally so thin it feels like there is nothing to them and it does literally feel like your second skin like you're almost wearing absolutely nothing because of how thin they are also I can't explain to you enough how light these feel on fo and I guess that's the whole part of the kind of Second Skin kind of feeling what I am really liking about these as I mentioned I do have flat feet and they do have in the insole like a bit of an arch support here which is really good and I think it's definitely needed because just look at that sole because of how thin these do actually feel I do feel like I could run a marathon in them because I just I just feel so light on my feet um but I am guessing that after a while I can kind of feel every single thing under my foot obviously I'm on carpet so it's a bit different but if I was walking like on cobblestones or anything that had some kind of text extra to it that is one thing that probably is going to be annoying because you can literally feel every single thing there isn't you know much thickness going on in the so so if you are going on maybe like a Terrain walk then these definitely aren't going to be comfortable also I do notice more that I can feel it in my heel which is a bit strange because obviously we have a thicker so here than we have up here but I feel like I don't know if it's maybe the way I walk I can literally feel the ground in my heel um and I think that is probably going to annoy me after a long time of wearing them and especially if I'm going on any kind of walks because I feel like my heel might as well just be on the floor I think for me these would be perfect for maybe a light kind of intensity support like binton they are very flexible as you can see I can literally bend my foot wherever and there is no kind of rigidness in the material and that is of course because of the kind of soft leather that they do have so yeah a spot like binton would be gray or a casual walk or if I am going out for the day but I just personally wouldn't wear these for any kind of long walks I feel already honestly that my heel as I mentioned is starting to bother me already and I've only been wearing these for 5 minutes but as I have said I am very flat and heavy footed um so most of my trainers I do need a little bit more support and of course as we have mentioned a trillion times the support is not really giving here because of this thin so,2025-06-23 14:44:45.480056 UTC

oR3HgrqnxoE,Air Jordan 1,I was wrong about this shoe these are the Black Phantom Travis Scott Air Jordan 1 lows this pair features a premium Black Suede and Nubuck upper with contrasting white stitching that iconic reverse swoosh on the lateral side and a traditional swoosh as well as Cactus Jack branding on the medial side the other standout details of the shoe are the Nike Air tag with Cactus Jack branding beside it on the tongue the new B design on the left heel wax laces as well as Cactus Jack and Air Jordan branding on the insoles now this pair does fit true to size as I'm a nine and a half and these are a ten and I just have a little bit of room and I have to say,2025-06-19 08:40:12.161434 UTC
F0Yk5Xctcaw,Nike Dunk Panda,I wore the panda dunks every day for a year here are the pros and cons of wearing the Nike Dunk low black and white panda here is what happened take a look at my panda dunks rip these are completely destroyed there are so many flaws going on with my pair of black and white Nike Dunk Lowe's it is absolutely crazy and ridiculous yes there's a lot of flaws after just one one year of wearing them every day I've worn these so much it's absolutely crazy just to see how disgusting and nasty these are gross ew they need a cleaning and these need a complete restoration especially on the bottom look at that drag look at the tow drag there's so much flaws going on creasing Galore scratches Galore just a bunch of markings and these are are just beat thrashed destroyed after wearing them every day for an entire year Nike Dunk Low's do fit true to size and I'm going to tell you guys right now do not expect Comfort they're not comfortable straight up they are not comfortable they're going to hurt your feet when you wear them all day long like I have as you guys can tell with these they're just not comfortable and when you do wear them for a lot you will have rips you're going to have ripping happen here on the back it's going to happen it's bound to happen with this cheap sock liner cheap material it's going to happen you're just bound to have rips bound to happen unfortunate bound to happen your drag is bound to happen when you wear them so much maybe to not this extent as you guys can see I definitely heal drag these a lot but I also didn't lace them all the way up and I just messed with the laces they were loose on me and I just let let it slide when I should not have because the heel drag is awful as well as the tow drag Stars non-existant anymore whatsoever on either shoe bound to happen look at all that drag drag drag just bound to happen the outsole is not made to last these sneakers are not made to last a long time the Nike Dunk low is not going to last you a long time I am expecting them to start having Soul separation they don't right now but I am expecting it I'm starting to expect it as a matter of fact I can peel it back right now with my finger look at that I can peel it back yeah starting to happen the Nike Dunk low is not made well at all cheap materials cheap leather pleather it's so plastic feeling I do not like the quality of Nike Dunks in general I love Nike SBs Nike SBs are so much better than regular Nike Dunks and the leather quality just shows that it does not stand up within the test of time when you constantly wear them it's just not going to hold up on well at all it's not going to hold up there's no durability at all they do fit true to size and they do look good when they're clean that's the only good thing about them other than that they're not worth the money really I would say and if you get them for retail sure do not spend anything over retail on a pair of these and at this point prices have certainly plummeted thankfully so now you can actually get Panda dunks for right around retail instead of having to pay $250 $300 for a pair which was absolutely ridiculous so prices have dropped but these are the flaws man there's a lot of them this is all bound to happen when you constantly wear them when you don't take care of them you don't clean them you just don't really care about them you don't give a crap at all this is what's going to happen to your Nike Dunks it's bound to happen and I just wanted to show you guys this disgusting pair my disgusting beat up worn pair that I've worn every single day they are so disgusting these have seen every weather condition rain snow everything I've worn them in every weather so guys they're just a disaster they really are I'm not a huge fan of Nike Dunks anymore I honestly only have these in my collection and that's it it's the only pair of Nike Dunks I have and I've worn them so much and I don't really plan on picking up any other regular Nike Dunks I prefer Nike SB dunk lows so much more better quality better storytelling better details and just better overall sneakers than the regular Nike Dunk glow the panda dunk man they've been an essential I feel like for a lot lot of people but they just don't hold up well at all it's one of those sneakers you're just going to have to constantly replace if you're constantly wearing them just not a great overall sneaker that's going to hold up well as far as wearability you're going to be able to pull off a ton of outfits I've worn so much with them but as far as the overall you know quality and just how they've held up not well not well at all these are the pros and cons of wearing the Nike Dunk low panda the black and white dunk Low's after 1 year make

Cc-KITETLl4,Adidas Samba,I'm Tim from tactics and this is the samba ADV from Adidas what up this Kyle from tactics board shop today we are wear testing the samb ADV from medida skateboarding so I've been skating these for about 3 weeks now and uh when I first got him I kind of had like a different like range of emotions I was really hyped on the look of the Tito it definitely felt a little stiff back here um in the heel area but in the the toe area was actually like pretty soft the sole was really stiff at first when I started wearing the shoe it was really tough and rigid but it it took only a couple sessions to really break it in so you could feel your board and feel comfortable doing flip tricks and and really just feeling your skateboard when I first put them on they were like really tight but I like it cuz my foot's narrow and if I compare it to any other shoe it would be the Dorado boost yeah these are the first first pair of Adidas that I've ever skated in definitely feel like I'm about to kick the soccer ball around with the boys when I'm wearing these yeah these shoes right out of the box super comfy they hug the arch of your foot um it almost feels like it was form for your foot the high heel cup here definitely holds your foot in super solid no chance you're going to be popping the heel out when these break in and pack out a little bit more so one thing I really liked about this shoe was I felt like it had a really good flick um despite having it's like a mainly a leather shoe right here um but this suede thing right here I feel like makes it skate just like a normal suede shoe my favorite thing about the shoe was the heel and how it was kind of more blocky and rigid and it actually made my heel flip tricks a lot easier I think my favorite thing about these though by far is definitely this like tongue it's super stitched down in there so like this thing doesn't move at all the entire time I skated I don't feel like I ever had to once like adjust my tongue which really bugs me about other shoes like especially uh I've been skating the match qus a lot lately and stuff like the tongue's just always getting sideways that always drives me nuts and this is like really nice really comfortable um that's another thing about these shoes is just for like walking around these were super super comfortable I really like the fit of these a lot um the insole in it is really thin but uh it is removable me get it out it's just a really thin kind of like basic insole same as you'll see in most Adidas shoes um but I don't jump down a ton of stuff but I did feel like you know things like me land Harden your heel definitely that heel absorbed a lot of impact and felt really good the cup sold these shoes felt really supportive even after breaking in so if you're trying to jump down things it'll offer you a lot of support so I've been skating these shoes for about 2 weeks and as you can see the stitching broke and we got a hole here when I first looked at the shoe and saw where the stitching was I was thinking that the leather would go all the way to the bottom and the suede was just sitting on top but it wasn't they're just kind of connected at the stitching and so when the stitching finally blew it just made a big old hole um I first started to notice it ripping after the first couple days but I do a lot of blackr tricks um we just do a lot of flip tricks when we're rolling around in the warehouse of tactics you can see that the laces are pretty high up but I still ended up breaking a few laces I broke a couple on the front and and then I broke a couple up here doing heel flips so I just tied this one a couple times but it wasn't too much of an issue all in all it's a pretty solid shoe definitely um you know I think you sacrifice a little bit of durability here with this kind of thing flopping down on you um but if you don't do just like constant flat ground all the time really good shoe to look into may feel like to skate a lot of Ledges maybe like to hit some rails jumping down stuff but aren't just like you know flat ground is your main game maybe look into something slightly more durable like the suu um but if you like just a little bit of heel protection really get you to look into for someone like me that's like really low impact I get a lot of transition uh it's maybe just a little thick for my preference I prefer you know maybe like the Lucas Premiere or like the match court but if you want that heal protection definitely a good option to look into with still having really good board feel here in kind of your 4 foot area once again guys this is Danny with tactics Board Shop here talking to you today about the Adidas Samba skate shoe if you have any comments or questions about these go ahead and leave them in the box below uh and if you want to pick up a pair for yourself go to tactics.com and they will hook you up,2025-06-19 08:41:00.531565 UTC
7_Du8E1kxgA,Adidas Gazelle,I'm an Adidas girl through and through and I have been slowly building my shoe collection I have a few pair of sambas and I recently got the gazelle and realized this fits a little bit different then I started looking at some of the spal Styles and thought if Adidas comes out with a drop of these that I want I need to know my size so in this video I'm going going to give you a comprehensive review on the fit and sizing between the samba gazelle and speal now everyone's feet are different of course and this is obviously going to be based on my experience with my foot so I am a very true to size size six I'd say 99% of the time my shoes are size six and very rarely do I need to stray away from this I think what's also important to mention that I don't think everyone thinks about is the shape of your foot my foot shape is an Egyptian foot which basically means that my toes slope downwards each toe is slightly shorter than the other toe there are other foot shapes such as the Roman foot the square foot and the Greek foot and depending on which shape of foot you have how your feet feel in the shape of the shoe is going to be different I'd say I have a pretty normal width foot definitely not narrow if anything it maybe leans a little bit more on the wide side all of this I think is important for you to know so when I go through the the fit and sizing of each shoe you know that it's based off of my foot template so starting with the ultimate OG the Adidas Samba for me these ones fit the best I would say these are very true to size they have the perfect amount of wiggle room for my toes they feel very kind of snug and secure around my foot but not too tight and the tongue is quite flexible as well this is the insole and you can see that they do not have any extra arch support so it's just a flat insole there's no extra cushioning there that's what it looks like so this insole is a little bit narrow I'm going to compare it to one that I love which is from my morale hiking boots you can see that the Adidas insult does not completely wrap around my foot it actually kind of stops right by my Arch the width is not really wide enough for the arch section of my foot you can see it doesn't really wrap around my Arch whereas with the morel insult you can see that it fully hugs my foot and wraps around that middle Arch part and the way that they made this shoe the insul is actually not flush with the side of the shoe so unless your foot is narrow and kind of neatly fits within the width of their insole you'll kind of feel it on the side of your arch compare this to my New Balance sneaker for example where the insole is completely flush with the side of the shoe so even if your foot is a bit wider than the inso you won't feel it against your arch because it's completely flush with the side of the shoe so here's a comparison of the Adidas insole and my Morel insole you can see how much wider the morel one is which is really great for me because it just fully hugs my foot feeling the side of the insole against the arch of my foot did feel annoying to me when I first got these and I actually just put in the morel insole instead and it completely solved the issue the back of the Adidas insoles are sticky but they're not exactly fully glued down so it's pretty easy to remove them and just put in one that you prefer instead the S has seven lace eyelids on either side of the shoe and I think that's kind of the perfect amount for me it just makes my foot feel really secure and snug in the shoe overall I'd say that the sambas fit the most true to size if you are in between sizes and you want a bit of a looser fit then I'd go up if you want a bit of a tighter fit I'd go down they fit great right out the box but if you have a little bit of wider feet I would suggest doing what I did which is just switching out the insole for a wider more comfortable one just so you don't feel the end of the insole kind of pressing against your arch moving on to the gazel these are the exact same length as the sambas even though they're the same length the overall feel of them is looser around the foot the tongue also is stiffer than on the samba I don't think it's made of leather like the rest of the shoe but it has a really cool unique texture design which I think is special to the gazelle style and the way that it's cut even though the tongue is a bit stiffer I don't feel it at all it doesn't bother me the gazelle insole actually does have arch support you can see that it has this little bit of padding right here in the arch otherwise it is the exact same length and width as the samba insole the only difference being it does have that extra padding in the arch like I said because these insoles are actually not quite wide enough for me at where my arch of the foot is this part kind of sits a bit weird like depending on the width of your foot the arch support might not actually be under your arch the gazelle also only has six eyelids on either side instead of seven like the samba so because it also has an overall looser fit and one less eyelet to get it to feel snug and secure the way that sambas do I do have to tie the laces quite a bit tighter so with these ones instead of replacing the Adidas inso I actually just put my Morel inso on top of the Adidas one and that gets them to fit the same way that the sambas do out of the box so in general these are true to size in terms of length they do feel more roomy around the foot but if you add an insole you can get them to feel the same way that the SAS do I would still stay true to size for these because you don't want the length to be any shorter you need that amount of wiggle room for your toes and if you do feel like it is a bit loose around your foot you can always throw an insole inside and get it to feel similar to the sambas and last we have the speals these ones definitely fit a bit longer you can see side by side with the samba that it is slightly longer and I know that it's longer because if I take out the insole and replace it with the morel one there's actually a little bit of gap between the insole and the toes because it's slightly bigger than the size 6 inso so for me because the regular size six fits a little bit long I just can't get these ones to fit right even if I tie the laces really tightly my heel is still lifting when I walk there's still too much room around my toes it just feels too long comfort-wise they're definitely the most cushy they not only have the arch support but they also have extra padding on the heel as well these ones also have seven lace eyelets like the samba and because the whole shoe is suede everything just feels very flexible and soft and cushy but because they're so cushy if you do have a little bit of a wider foot like me they might feel more kind of narrow and Tighter around the arch again this is something that can totally be solved by simply switching out the inso to one that you prefer what that won't do however is change the length so with with these ones I would say they do fit long and I would size down half a size and then I would switch out the insole with my own insole so that they would feel more comfortable around my width of foot and then again just comparing all the different insoles the samba the gazelle and the speal they're all exactly the same size they are the same width and they are the same length so I think when people say that one shoe fits more narrow than the other other there are factors like whether or not the inso has cushioning or what material the actual shoe is that play a roll in how tight it feels around your foot so in summary the SAS and gazel have a true to size length and the gazelle has an overall looser fit around the foot than the samba I would stay true to size for both of these Styles since the length is accurate and if the gazelle feels too loose you can always add an insole in there for a more snug fit even though the insole length is the same the speals seem to fit half a size longer than the other two it does have the most snug fit around your foot because it is the most cushioned I'd go half a size down since the regular size is too long and if you have a bit of a wider foot I would replace the insole with one that you prefer instead all right that's it hopefully you can take what I have shared and apply it to your width and shape of foot to figure out what size and what shoe style is best for you if you found the video helpful give it a like subscribe for more

gYfPRMBTu9Q,PUMA Suede,"I'm feeling generous today so if you guys can get this video up to 2,000 likes I'm going to give away a pair of the Puma suedes all you guys got to do is like this video hit that subscribe button and comment down below let me know what size you need I wore the Puma suede every day for one week and this is what happened here are the pros and cons of wearing the Puma suede sizing the Puma suede does fit true to size so they are very very comfortable you do have to go true the size in my opinion this is an 11 I wear a 10 1 12 or an 11 I wear the 11 and I'm good to go true to size with the Puma suedes they do have this leather inside which is very soft and does not make your foot sweat it's extremely comfortable on the inside bottoms of course are going to get dirty but I don't really care it's that white midsole and out sole there are different colors but it's going to become dirty anyway that's what happens when you wear your sneakers it's very very easy to clean manage and take care of if you want to clean them you're not going to have a problem doing so just be careful with the suede upper because you do not want to get this suede too wet I did wear these a little bit in the rain it was a light drizzle but I don't recommend wearing them in heavy rain because it's going to be a nightmare as far as the suede you want to keep the suede nice and hairy as it comes so definitely don't try to get these super duper wet you guys can notice one of my laces here got messed up do not let your dogs chew your laces that's what happened I do have a puppy so it did happen on these cuz I left them on the ground that's my own fault my own doing but other than that they're very clean they're very comfortable and they're very easy to wear and manage and take care of now you can get Puma suedes for right around retail sometimes they do go on sale where they're under retail which is a great price for this sneaker they're not too expensive you're going to spend under $100 on a pair of puma suedes and I highly recommend them they are extremely comfortable I have a big sneaker collection and a lot of these other sneakers are just not comfortable right I wear them but they're not comfortable the Puma suede happens to be one of the most comfortable sneakers in my entire sneaker collection I chose this black colorway because it's very easy to wear you do have the black you got the little bit of cream here and then you have the white mids soole and out soole I think it's just a clean color way you can get your puma suedes in a bunch of different colors and a different materials as well for the upper but I just went with the classic Puma suede I think it's very very comfortable and just an overall nice looking wearable everyday sneaker you do have the gold on the hit here for the Puma Suede and then you do have on the tongue the Puma logo the little hit of green to throw that off to set it off very nicely you don't have to wear green with these of course just wear black wear basically anything you want with this colorway and that's why I went with this colorway you do have the Puma logo in the gold on the the back heel as well you do have the Puma branding in white as you guys can see they will get dirty I do have to clean these but hey it's just a great overall pair of sneakers I highly recommend picking up a pair if you never tried on a pair of pumas suedes I highly recommend at least trying them on see how you like them on feet because they're better on feet than they are in hand in my personal opinion but I really like about the Puma suede as well as these laces these laces are thick right they're very thick they're not thin lace es and I like that it reminds me of other sneakers as well so these extra thick laces are very very nice I really appreciate the laces on this sneaker I think it's just a nice look overall you don't have to tie them if you don't want to I do tie them you know most sneakers I don't really tie I just tuck in the laces but when it comes to the Puma suede I did tie them I think it looks cleaner on feet on the inside you do have gold with the black Pumas all inside that insole styling these is very easy because it's just an all suede black upper this colorway in particular is so easy to style like I said before there's a ton of different colorways so I'm sure you're guaranteed to find a colorway that matches your style that you something you wear often there's definitely a puma suede in your preferred color so be sure to check them out I highly recommend a pair this video is not sponsored by Puma I want to make that very clear I'm not being paid to do this video I just really enjoy this sneaker a ton since I've been wearing them I've worn these in the rain a little bit light rain I've worn them of course when it's nice outside windy outside I've wore them to walk my dogs plenty of times every single day I think it's just a great wearable overall casual sneaker you know we spend money on all these other hype sneakers when we don't really need to at the end of the day to look good it's more about how you style it more than anything else so I highly recommend trying out a pair of Puma suedes throw it off you know try something different that's what I wanted to do here and I'm really happy I did stepping out of my comfort zone and just really trying something new for me personally right obviously the Puma sued is not a new sneaker by any means but for me it is so I wanted to try these out and I'm very happy I did so they're very affordable right the average person is not going to go spend two3 $400 $1,000 on a pair of sneakers this is more for the average person you don't have to be a sneaker head to even appreciate the Puma suedes if you are a sneaker head you might want to give these a shot because it's something different something unique something that you're probably not going to see in every sneaker heads collection I'm here to tell you give them a try I highly recommend them I think you guys will be pleasantly surprised with the Puma suede overall between Comfort style and how easy they are just to slip on I think it's a great overall everyday wear and I can't recommend them enough to be honest guys I truly think this sneaker is incredible and I understand now finally why people that like Puma suedes why they like them so much the Puma Community is very very tight and I understand why right I understand it now I get it people that love their Pumas they love their puma suedes and I totally understand it it has me intrigued now and wanting to try other Puma sneakers so let me know Down Below in the comments what other Puma am I missing out on if you love Pumas let me know Down Below in the comments Danny try this Puma try that Puma let me know and I'll probably make it happen because I'm very intrigued now and very interested in getting more colorways of the Puma suede along with trying other models by Puma I think Puma is absolutely killing it with other sneakers as well and the Puma suede here is just a great iconic classic sneaker and why not start with something that Puma is known for this sneaker is known so why did why not start with that right so this was definitely a pleasant wear I'm very very happy I'm going to continue to wear them each and every day and just really beat these up I'm very very happy that I did I think this Puma suede sneaker is honestly incredible especially for the price point it's definitely definitely a must for me personally I'm very happy with Puma I think these Puma suedes are classic they're iconic and they're definitely worth trying out if you never have give them a shot the leather will not make your foot all sweaty I know some other leather sneakers they'll make your foot all sweaty and just nasty at the end of the day but this Puma suede they did it right they did it right with the leather it's not too thin it's not too thick I think it's just perfect amount of leather on the inside and I'm very very happy and pleased with them and they're very easy to take care of even on the inside right even the inside is very easy to take care of now it has the white sock liner here so I have been wearing a mix of both black and white socks just to see what would happen there is a little bit of the black from the sock liner right there a little bit going on but nothing too drastic I am going to just switch to just wearing white socks so it doesn't get any worse and I'll clean the inside so that you know it stays that nice white color but other than that I'm very happy with them and the suede is extremely soft so I'm very very pleased to say that the Puma suede has been a great wear for me personally let me know Down Below in the comments what do you guys think about the Puma suedes if you guys own a pair or thinking about buying a pair I highly recommend them let me know Down Below in the comments comment a bunch of fire

as2YeEC-p7A,ASICS GEL-LYTE III,I'm going to completely deconstruct this A6 gel light 3 and even get into the mid soole to find the gel unit so if you want to see what's inside stick around to the end let's go so I'm going to quickly pull apart the whole shoe then we'll look at everything in a bit more detail I'll even cut open the gel unit so you can actually see what's inside there she is in bright orange just under the hill so these are the Navy orange gel light 3s that i s spped up for about 20 quid online as they're completely battered and probably more gray than Navy at this point my mate flow actually gave me a bit of background on them as they used to be a gr grail for some and released in 2013 around the same time as the Ronny 5 total eclipse kind of helping with the reemergence of the A6 gel light models in the early to mid 2010s this pair has definitely seen better days and I hope the purists out there can forgive me as I'm doing this all in the name of scientific research I actually ran a poll on my Instagram with 25% of people saying not to pull them apart but 75% of you Savages saying to do it so here we go I thought there was actually another unit in the front end of the sole but it turns out there's just a really thin pad stuck on top of the sole which I think is just to help absorb the pressure in that main pressure point Point okay so let me just get the unit out and we'll cut this thing open it's mad to think it hasn't seen the light of day in nearly 10 years and here it is and to be honest I was pretty underwhelmed when I first got it out but I'm guessing it's just been heavily decompressed over the years under all that pressure okay so I thought at this point it' be good to just go through everything and and dissect what's what um so yeah so starting with the upper yeah I've took it a little bit further and you can see so that you've got obviously the mesh and these panels over the top which underneath the uh sort foot guard I guess the toe box you can see there's this like more durable rubber so that obviously gets stitched onto the mesh and then the mesh is uh yeah the mesh is sort of the main bulk of the upper with all the panels and everything stitched on and then yet under these you know these like what are they the G like three sort of trademark things which isn't actually that well stitched to be fair yeah under there you can see the 3M and then you've got this sort of plate and under it there's this that sits over the gel unit this other bit of uh sort of cushioning and everything for your heel then you can get really see that that Eva really like just a nice like the outer sole the rubber is really hard but then that is actually really nice and soft that marshmallow uh yeah and then obviously the big piece the resistance should we cut this over open it go down the middle this way cut it in half and it's actually gel it's actually like freaking glue or something actual gel in there so yeah that's it big up yourselves Please Subscribe see you soon,2025-06-23 14:47:23.464052 UTC
VFBTklVy43o,Veja Esplar,I'm going to do a quick review of my veja sneakers after two months of wear the outer edges of each sneaker around the pinky toe have significant amount of creasing and folds which gives a worn and damaged look to the sneaker even though it's only been worn for two months in addition as you can see on the inside heel of each shoe the cloth material has fallen apart and broken off from the sneaker for paying around 150 dollars for these sneakers I would expect the quality of leather and materials inside the shoe to be much higher and not have this much damage after two months of light wear in short I would not recommend buying these sneakers,2025-06-23 14:57:49.692790 UTC
6rTziWfdjDI,Veja Esplar,I've worn my VI esps over 120 times and I can honestly say I've got some pretty unpopular opinions let's talk about it today's video is an honest review of the vea SS and my experience wearing them we'll talk about Comfort durability and everything you need to know if you're thinking about buying a pair hi I'm McKay I make videos about minimalism fashion education and finding your style as a normal person they has absolutely took the World by storm from Royals to influencers to Everyday commuters they are absolutely everywhere I see them every day all over my office and on my commute and they're just getting more and more popular still over the past couple of years I've worn these shoes at least 120 times I got these shoes before I started tracking my wardrobe so I would say 120 is a conservative estimate but needless to say I have worn these shoes a lot as far as the appearance goes I do remember being drawn to the design they're simple they're elegant the athetic is just perfect for me I've never been into chunky shoes I didn't get into the air force ones and I was really really excited to see this very simple slim profile coming back they're basic enough to be versatile and match absolutely everything while still feeling very feminine and light I'd say the exps have the most subtle branding with the white stitching that's something that I was personally very drawn to I like that they were very understated it wasn't overly recognizable and I didn't think that I was going to get tired of them because of that but if that's not your thing there are plenty of other colorways let's get into how they've held up the leather has maintained its shape really well and there isn't any greasing they're honestly in great condition for how much I've worn them and a bonus is that they're very easy to clean the only thing that's starting to come undone is the stitching on the back of the suede which really isn't too big of a deal but other than that they look absolutely amazing for the sizing I took a size 8 or a 39 which is my normal size I know that a lot of people say that they run pretty large into size down so I do remember trying on a couple of different sizes and actually being pretty surprised that I did take away my a regular size it is worth mentioning that I think they still only sell whole sizes so it might be worth still trying on a couple sizes if you're able to especially if you're between sizes and this is where a lot of people aren't going to like what I have to say but I feel like somebody needs to say it so let's get into the cons one of the main reasons I wanted these shoes so much especially for the $150 price tag is that so many girlies were talking about how comfortable they are that they were wearing them all day and on these long trips and I just don't see how I've had these for over 2 years and my number one complaint is that they are very stiff so the leather is very stiff and the Sol is stiff as well if you look at me gently pressing there really isn't much give I can really force them to go a bit further but they just naturally don't want to bend because there isn't much Flex they end up really limiting my movement as I walk because my foot isn't able to bend to the degree that I would like it to the leather is very stiff as well and just just didn't mold to my foot I didn't have an issue breaking them in I know a lot of people have talked about the tongue digging in and getting blisters that they can be pretty uncomfortable to break in that wasn't an issue for me they just never really became comfortable what more is there to say actually I have a lot more to say the sole is pretty stiff as well it's not that rubbery material that I would typically think of with sneakers something that is really soft and absorbs shock these are not like that this is a very unique soul I can feel every Rock and you're going to hear me coming from a mile away because they are pretty loud again there is nothing to absorb that shock and there really isn't any cushion there so you're going to feel it all there isn't much tread and because there isn't any cushion you can clearly see the way that my footprint and my individual toes have worn in these shoes there is just nothing to absorb that probably not a surprise at this point but the insole isn't cushioned it's really just a flat and hard insole even the shoelaces are stiff I remember when I tried these on way way back in person that even the sales associate was complaining about how much they hated veas because they didn't like having to lace the shoes granted this was not the best sa but they definitely had a full body workout just trying to get them laced up for me overall the shoe just stayed very stiff for me it never loosened up I've seen some reviews saying that all leather is stiff it's always going to be a bit rigid and that it can never be as comfortable as can canvas and that's just not true I'll get into that in a couple minutes the last thing that is worth mentioning is that they're not breathable so this is going to come down to preference and how sweaty your feet are this is something that I've noticed in general with a lot of leather shoes and that a lot of companies will have some kind of ventilation or holes to help with that breathability so this is something that I've personally had an issue with to some degree with all Lea shoes but these ones are particularly bad this is where I think it's helpful to compare to a similar shoe so that you can see the differences I bought the mjy sneakers a year ago when I was planning a trip to Italy this was my first trip to Europe and I absolutely knew that the veas were not going to cut it I was planning for a lot of walking a lot of long days and I knew that I needed something else I ended up paying about $200 versus the veas which are 150 the M jammies have a really soft salt and were comfortable from day one I didn't have to do any breaking in they just came ready to go the leather is extremely soft and does have a little bit of texture versus the M Jamies which are completely smooth you can see a little bit of creasing but I don't mind that you can see by comparison that they just have a lot more give and if I really press them they go in pretty far that's something that I've definitely learned to look for I am always going to check the flex from here on out so very much a lesson learned the tread on these also isn't great it would be nice if there was a little bit more traction to them but overall they are so much more comfortable I can live with that and since I've gotten these I've worn these the majority of the time I do want to show a side by side because the the difference is just day and night I'm really not trying to push the M Jamies this is just the most similar shoe that I own and can compare the veas 2 first let's take a look at the flexibility the veas clearly don't have much give and the stiffer the back is the more likely you are to get blisters same thing with the toe box your feet naturally Flex as you walk so this just isn't a great design the veas are glued to the sole which isn't terrible but they will eventually come apart versus the M Jamies which are glued and hand sewn for extra durability again as your foot flexes there are naturally going to be areas that become more prone to separating so having shoes that are sewn on top of being glued is going to really help keep them together the tongue is cut straight and the leather is very stiff which means that you're going to be very prone to getting blisters and having the tongue dug in versus something that is soft leather and padded that will be a very different experience taking a look at the inside the foot beds are very different the M Jamies go to the edges they're padded and they have perforation which is going to really help with that breath ility the veas have zero give no ventilation and the souls are noticeably heavier I know it sounds like I am just hating on veas but believe me I tried so hard to like these there's a reason that I wore them Time After Time After Time I kept trying to break them in and just hoping that it would get better and it just didn't I know that they're incredibly popular I'm just genuinely confused I don't understand the hype and I wish that they were better I love the look of them they are still absolutely perfect as far as my style goes they fit my wardrobe perfectly aesthetic wise but they just don't make sense they're just not comfortable I don't know what in The Emperor's New Clothes kind of mentality is going on here but I still hear so many people raving about how comfortable and amazing and high quality they are and they just don't get it I feel like I'm missing something I don't know if I got a completely different shoe than everybody else in the world or what is going on here but it's very odd at the end of the day yes I probably will still continue to wear them from time to time as long as I'm not walking very far but the majority of the time I reach for my M Jamies I definitely wouldn't Rey them and I might even resell them at some point there are just so many better shoes out there for around the same price range or shoes that are a little bit more expensive but exponentially higher quality I have heard that the Campos are more comfortable but I have a bit of a bad taste in my mouth just based off of how many people have talked about the SARS being comfort able and they're absolutely not I don't know how much I can believe the Campos are going to be much better I don't even think it's worth wasting any more money on vea trying to experiment with their shoes anymore especially when I already have a replacement that is so much better so are veas cute yes do they match everything absolutely it's a white shoe do I think they're worth $150 personally I don't think so but that's just my opinion so let me know if you feel differently thanks for watching and I will catch you in the next video bye,2025-06-23 14:57:44.076590 UTC
DYuX9AchtV0,Air Jordan 1,Jordan Ones with no laces so this is the Jordan 1 flyes that's supposedly the easiest Jordan one to put on your feet because you don't have to tie them they come with velcro straps and a zip around the heel so let's see if they really work now regular Jordan Ones are a pretty standard shoe that you tie with laces but these look like they have laces but are actually connected by a velcro strap so when you want to get them on your feet you can simply loosen the velcro and the laces appear to come off but up top you still see one more strap that actually releases into a zipper around the heel that makes it extremely easy to take your foot in and out of the shoe so when you put it all together you get the world's easiest Jordan 1 to put on your feet,2025-06-19 08:40:11.497171 UTC
db81dRHrNKo,New balance 550,Lord we couldn't close another woman's shout gave us a pride she said well it didn't come back home last night no what's up gang so we have a new sneaker pickup these are the new balance 550s these actually came out I I don't want to say they came out the hype was in 2021 people were going crazy for these they sold out everywhere and today we're going to talk about really everything that you need to know about them if you do want to pick up a pair we all know as of late Taylor Swift was wearing these people went crazy New Balance restocked I actually had these sitting in the closet the reason they were sitting in the closet this isn't a new sneaker sneaker pickup they were sitting in the closet because I ended up getting an 11 and a half back when these were just selling like crazy and they were hard to get so I bought the 11 and a half thinking of just side swap so that's the first takeaway you can get from this video if you are gonna pick these up make sure you go true to size now this 11 and a half fits I just feel like if I were to wear it all day long it wouldn't be great so I'm gonna sell these for 50 you can buy them down below in the description an 11 and a half steel and I'm gonna pick myself up a size 12. but let's talk about these right so ald did a collab with new balance and that's kind of what skyrocketed the they originally came out back in 1989 and they are a basketball shoe granted everyone today is obviously wearing them a lifestyle shoe and honestly they fit that aesthetic we all know New Balance to be like this chunky kind of dad type sneaker and typically really good quality these are not the best quality I will tell you that first and foremost New Balance typically has the best craftsmanship in materials when it comes to their shoes especially at the price points that they're charging these coming in at 110 they're not the greatest there's simple flaws on them leather isn't that great uh really really cheap material but again for 110 dollars it's a lot better than what a lot of these other brands are charging way more for and it's more of the aesthetic and the style of the shoe they are extremely comfortable I do have another pair they do have the ortholite insoles in them which I don't want to say is this crazy technology but it's comfortable like you can wear these all day and your feet aren't hollering you don't got to break them in you can just wear them and go which I personally like the other thing I really like about the shoe is just the way it's constructed honestly the fact that you have different panels on this pair specifically we have this black hole box leather the upper is more of white it's a bunch of holes in the leather I'm assuming that's to help with the breathability of the sneaker and you have mesh back towards the ankle more leather the sole of the shoe actually goes up a little bit higher which must have something to do with the way the shoe is stitched into the sole I'm not exactly sure I'm not the shoe surgeon just know that these are comfortable and they are clean so those are the most important things make sure you go true to size again 110 dollars that's amazing I can see why New Balance sold a lot of these if you're trying to get the ald pair those are like still sitting two three four hundred dollars at the time of recording this video New Balance just did a restock on these shoes I'll put the link Down Below in the description if anybody wants to grab a pair I really like these I totally think they're worth it hence why I personally pick them up I think they look good with a lot of different fits and they're super versatile on top of the fact that there's just so many different colors that you can get I definitely have my eyes on the white and green pair that's kind of a must for me let me know what you guys think do any of you own a pair of 550s or any new balances in general I actually have a lot of pairs that I need to just review and date you guys on because I have a lot of shoes sitting on Ice that I need to pull out the box and just review this is your boy sneaker life if you guys have any questions make sure to drop them below like this video subscribe if you're new help the channel grow and I'll catch you guys in the next,2025-06-23 14:50:46.014790 UTC

BW5bz-VdM1M,New Balance 990,So currently there are six different versions of the New Balance 990 model there's the V1 2 3 4 5 and six but I wanted to go ahead and cover some of the differences between all of the six models they actually have about 18 models in the 99x series across the board in this video I'm only going to be focusing on the 990s but if you guys want another video covering the rest of the models leave a comment in the comment section drop a like on the video and I will do so also if you guys want to shop the current selection on new balance's website of the 990 sneakers they have available please use the links in the description it does give me a little bit of a kickback and it lets New Balance know that you guys mess with the channel greatly appreciate when you guys do that so we'll start off with the humble beginnings of 1982 the New Balance 990 released for $100 and this is the very first model in all of the 99x lineage again the price point was $100 in 1982 if you include inflation that's about $311 in today's day and age which is kind of crazy it really shouldn't have worked out for New Balance but for some reason it did and it became a Cornerstone of New Balance as most companies were trying to manufacture overseas New Balance was made in the USA which is something that definitely stood out so even though the price was elevated so was the premium materials in the craftsmanship which laid the foundation for New Balance with the 990 V1 now the version of the 990 V1 that I have is a Tenny sandest one I can't really speak to the originals since I don't have an original one I'm assuming that they look somewhat similar to the Retro pair but if I'm wrong leave a comment in the comment section there's a lot of suede in about three different panels on the upper including the tow box the mid panel and then also the heel there's a plastic heel clip on the back and then also there is mesh on the toe box uh some of the collar area and the tongue the tongue is very thin as well and you do have some sewn on New Balance logos on each side of the shoe the midsole is pretty plain they don't have any crazy proprietary foam from what I could tell in the midsole and then you do have a pretty thick rubber out soole as her sizing of the 990 V1 I would go true to size or half size down depends on what you like on your feet I like a little bit more wiggle room in my toebox area some people might find it having too much wiggle room so trud to size or half size down if you have a difference in opinion of course leave a comment in the comments section after the release of the 990 V1 they released a 995 996 a 997 a 998 and a 999 but in 1989 15 years later they actually released the 990 V2 so lots of things changed from the original 990 to the 990 V2 specifically the midsole which featured absorb for shock absorbing and with the absorb foam running the entire length of the endcap so it actually ends up popping out the heel a little bit and kind of a sealed bubble so obviously with 15 years in between there's a ton of different changes from the first version to the more modernized 990 V2 the first thing is the addition of the reflective panels on the front the sides and the back of the shoe it sounds like this actually started back in ' 86 with the 995 however I like the way that they executed the reflective details on the 990 V2 from the 997 998 999 you started to see a little bit more of a sculpted midsole and that continues in the 990 V2 I like the look of the midsole as well it gives the shoe a lot more character than what it previously had there's also prominent absorb branding on the midsole of the shoe now similar to the other 990 series thus far it's a cut and so upper so you have suedes or Leathers overlaid over top of mesh the updates from the 990 V1 to this one has a lot more plush liner as well as a suede or leather tongue also there's a lot more tongue padding on the V2 and another change from the previous version they have some extra layers of suede underlaid over top of some of the other suedes so it's not just mesh and leather or suede it's actually like a third layer in between which is something that adds a little bit more Dynamic to the shoe but it's something that we see carried on to Future versions of the 99x model one more change on the tongue they actually have embroidered details for the 990 New Balance made in USA at least on the version that I have and on the previous version you just had kind of like a tag on the tongue as for sizing of the 990 V2 and the rest of these sneakers really for me it's true to size or half size down depending on your foot and what you prefer for Comfort I have a little bit of a wider foot I like the extra wiggle room in my toe box however some people find that there's just too much room so if you guys own any of the 990 models leave a comment in the comment section what is the sizing that you go with personally again I usually go true to size with everything and if I have extra room I have extra room and I'm okay with it moving on to 2012 we have the 30th birthday of the 990 series and they released the third version of the 990 V3 and I think it's safe to say that the 990 V3 is probably everybody's favorite version of the 990 it's the one that we've seen most collaborations on as well jail fresh goods and so on it is one of the best looking New Balance models I think in this modern day and age and again this one released in 2012 you can definitely see the steady progression between all the three models that they've released thus far with the 990 V1 2 and three it's definitely a more Sleek version a more mesh version as well they have more mesh panels on the V3 than they had on the V1 and 2 making it kind of more of a lifestyle focused pair of sneakers which is funny because you look at all these sneakers and we think automatically lifestyle but uh from the Inception of the New Balance 990 was actually performance- driven so similar to the way the Air Jordans have kind of matured those were performance sneakers with Air Jordan 1 2 3 and four those are now lifestyle sneakers similar to the 990s the third version features endurance rubber on the out soole as well as incap in the midsole and I'm not sure if this is true to the originals but the midsole outsole has carbon fiber actually in the plate so that's a nice premium addition as well for the tongue you have New Balance logo that's kind of a fused overlay and then has a little bit of a waffle pattern on the padded tongue so it's actually kind of a mesh tongue instead of leather at least on the colorway that I have now one of the biggest changes between the V2 and the V3 is the encap midsole versus the absorb from the V2 so I'm not exactly sure why they changed it from absorb to endcap it seems like some of the other models that New Balance released before the V3 actually feature different variations of endcap so the difference between absorb and endcap from what I found is absorb was supposed to be more of a superior blend a foam cushioning and compression set featuring a bit of rubber encap is a core of soft cushioning of Eva in the midsole with a tough polyurethane rim for more support and durability leave a comment in the comment section if you have a preference between absorb or endcap but honestly I feel like endcap is the one that they've been going forward with that's what we've seen on the next couple versions that I'll get into now as I mentioned the V3 had the most panels on the upper the tongue changed a little bit as well they definitely have less suede on the V3 than they did on the previous versions but that's not necessarily a bad thing because of the way that they integrated all the mesh panels it looks really cool as well I like that there's a bunch of circular cutouts between the Suede and the leather where you have that mesh kind of shining through again I feel like this is one of the best looking New Balance models to date and I really appreciate what they did with the V3 I Never Had The Originals back in the day but now 12 years later after the original release we have tons of different retros that are coming out and they have a lot of new breath because of all of the different collaborations that we've seen and that we'll probably continue to see in the future so fast forward to four years in the future 2016 you have the release of the 990 V4 it was definitely good timing to release this because of the datu trends that were going crazy the V4 featured the encap midsole with a polyurethane ring with an Eva core which helped provide a little bit of balance between cushioning and stability the midsole sculpting with the incap looks very similar to the previous version but it doesn't have the carbon fiber in the outsole I think out of the six signatured models of the 990 the V3 and the V4 are the ones that look the most similar for the V4 at least the version that I have you have the prominent made in the USA branding on the tongue that is stitched on they also switched it up with a suede tongue and the New Balance logo looks a little bit bigger the toe down look between the three and the four looks very similar as well but you do have a little bit more mesh cutouts on the V3 than the V4 the overall shape between the two models though again look very very similar and again sizing on the V3 V4 I would say true to size or half size down depending on your comfort or the width of your foot again wide foot gang over here so I go true to size now in 2019 they actually released the 990 V5 which looked a lot different than the previous version of the 990 V4 the major difference you could tell from the V5 you could see the TPU power strap that wraps along the upper and that's definitely something that stands out for Better or For Worse I don't know if people love the look of it back then but similar to the previous versions you do have reflective details in the front sides and the back of the shoe the V5 also features the endcap midsole with endurance rubber outsole on the heel of the shoe you actually have a V for the fifth version the V5 retailed at $185 again fit true to size or half size down depending on your foot I don't recall seeing any collaborations of the V FES uh thus far but this is probably a model that we'll see in the future come back in some sort of a retro form so in 2022 New Balance actually released the sixth version of the New Balance 990 and the retail was at $200 again you have the reflective details in the front sides and the back of the shoe you have a pretty large reflective n on the side panels of the shoe this time around and then there seems to be a lot more meshed than on the V5 also this is the first time that the New Balance logo on the side panels don't sit on a suede panel it actually sits on mesh the overall shape of the 990 V6 is definitely the most modernized look of the 990 series that we've seen so far it's definitely chunkier and bigger than what we've seen in the past not only the shape of the midsole has been changed it does feature endcap along with fuel cell but the combination of endcap and fuel cell is nice with some support as well as some extra added comfort and I like that they've been adapting to more modern times with the fuel cell line and the running line just being amazing it's nice to see them integrate this into the lifestyle segment now after this model came out in 2023 we have the 991 V2 and I did a video on those on my channel as well as a comparison between the 990 V6 if you guys want to go check that video out feel free to do so again if you guys want to see more of a complete timeline to cover some of the items that I missed like the 995 6789 uh leave a comment in the comment section let me know I'd love to do that if you guys are interested leave a comment in the comment section what do you guys think about the 990 lineage so far the 990 V6 being the latest and greatest maybe we'll see a 990 V7 in 2025 or so exciting to see the future what New Balance creates and it's honestly really rad that they can create new models in a more modern age uh something that Jordan brand has a hard time with they have retros that definitely do very very well people love the Air Jordans 1 3 four 5S Etc however when they create new models they're all performance-based and they don't have that luster of the cuto era that New Balance can now bring forward with us with the 990 lineage that they've had so honestly it's been awesome to see the evolution of the 99x line and uh I can't wait to see what New Balance brings us in the future hope you guys enjoy the video again if you guys did like the video or you have other things you guys want to add in the comment section feel free to do so hopefully you have a good rest of the day and hopefully see you back for some more content soon all right peace guys,2025-06-23 14:42:41.948095

a5GvaiMtxy0,Converse Chuck Taylor All Star,When shopping for a pair of Converse we all want to know are Converse actually comfortable before we invest our money in a pair of these iconic sneakers I've been wearing Converse since I was 12 years old so for nearly 20 years and I've owned countless different types of Converse in my experience Converse are comfortable sneakers for everyday wear thanks to their flexible gum rubber soles and soft canvas upper they are comfortable for running errands and short walks however they would benefit from an added inso if you require extra arch support the inner soles and out SES of Converse sneakers are bendy and flexible which makes for a comfortable step stiff soes tend to cause a lot of pain in the feet so it's always best to look for a high quality rubber sols on sneakers like the ones on convers at first the canvas material on Converse can feel a little bit stiff however it definitely softens quickly after a few wears and will mold to the shape of your feet personally I find the toe box to be comfortable and I have a slightly wide step if you're worried about sizing for wide feet I have a full Converse sizing guide Linked In the description for you the laces and the sneaker tongue once loosened they do fit nicely on top of your feet without rubbing the tongue is made from canvas again just like the body of the shoe and it will feel slightly stiff at first but after a few wees it will soften and feel great if you want some additional help with breaking in Converse I have a video here if you found the info in this video helpful please hit the like button to help it reach more people thanks,2025-06-23 11:21:42.429064 UTC
qSaizKVxghg,Yeezy 350 v2,Yeezys are back in the drop calendar just like they never left and the pair that we're taking a look at today is actually a little bit of a surprise okay here we have the box uh this is the one thing that just never really gets surprising about Yeezy boxes they are all pretty much the same we got the 350 on the front the boost on the side I didn't catch yesterday's video essentially I unboxed these things for the first time when I opened the package I really was met with a shock a shocking smell this box kind of smells like smells a bit weird in here these things smell like a green plant people use to to get hot these things stink and I have no idea why it is very strange now because I bought this from goat I expect anybody who actually gets these from Adidas is not gonna smell like that either way let me slide these things open and try not to breathe in too much because these are strong but we have today's sneaker the Yeezy 350 dark Beluga we have them guys the dark belugas a pair that was supposed to release last year and I don't need to get into all of the details we all know by now Adidas just opened up a raffle on the confirmed app for this pair of sneakers and the 350 Onyx both of these released today on May the 31st so depending on what time you're watching this video you either know whether You've Won or you might even still be waiting also if you're on the U.S today is the big Yeezy day 2023 where Adidas is going to be dropping a bunch of different sneakers and the EU in the UK that's all happening tomorrow on June the first we should all have an opportunity to grab plenty of different sneaker models not just this one and also if you're out in the US let us all know how Yeezy day 2023 went for you did you manage to get a bunch of pairs how did Adidas drop all of them uh let us get ready give us the advantage getting ready for tomorrow now retail on this pair is unchanged so it's still 200 pounds here in the UK or 230 dollars if you're around the US even though 15 of that goes to Kanye West and an undisclosed amount goes to charity according to Adidas so I was kind of half expecting Adidas to pull a quick one and raise the retail price a little bit to cover some of those losses but yeah luckily they kept the prices the same okay so what really surprised me about this pair of sneakers was the smell yes but apart from that was the colorway now online even through the official images the early leaks the on foot shots that we've seen all before the release of this pair was all kind of a very dark gray almost black looking sneaker however when you get this pair in hand you'll realize it's not so much of a dark gray or black color it's really just a very dark green literally when you compare the original belugas to this dark Beluga colorway you can really tell that they've literally just flipped the colors so this is all of the lighter Grays that are on top and this one's all of the darker Grays that are on top obviously except for the orange stripe that still exists and is pretty much identical from one to the other and of course in that neon orange stripe that moves across the side you still get that sply 350 text you know what something about this really bright stripe I prefer a lot more on the darker color of this shoe I just think that the dark colors Contour trust with this orange stripe super nicely I also think these darker colors make this Beluga sneaker a lot easier to style and throw together outfits I was super excited to be able to get this pair of belugas when they dropped the reflective version because it was the first time that I'd ever had this colorway obviously it's a very iconic colorway from 2016. it's one of the ogs when it comes to 350s what I found through owning this pair of shoes is that I never really ended up wearing it as much as I imagined to there's definitely something about this colorway that is slightly harder to style and put outfits together with now obviously I still think these are fine the colorway is great but I did find myself opting for other colorways of the 350 over this quite a few times and I seriously think this dark Beluga is gonna be a lot more wearable even just since I've had these things in I've tried out a few different outfits and I just find them to match a lot better and just look a lot nicer on foot I found them generally speaking just easier to style obviously this OG iconic colorway of the 350 is always going to have a place in my heart and I'm never getting rid of this pair of shoes but gotta be honest I'm really feeling the darker tones from this pair I also think comparatively speaking there's something about having all of the darker knits surrounding this orange stripe highlights the stripe a lot more than it does on this one now it's obviously still the same color it's still freaking neon orange so it's very noticeable on both pairs so there is something about this one that definitely highlights it makes it a lot more visible obviously both of these sneakers are very very similar so obviously I think people who have the belugas already might find it a little bit tougher to want to actually buy this pair of shoes because they are so similar not to mention the fact that this is the fourth iteration of the Beluga colorway there was the original the 2.0 the reflective and now the dark Beluga anybody who owns any of those different variations there's definitely a lot more people who own one of those different iterations and might want to pass up on this one I can say for certain these things did sell out on the Adidas app so uh they're all gone people obviously wanted to get their hands on them and I'm not entirely sure what they're gonna end up reselling at and as far as the Yeezy 350 goes in terms of practicality well honestly I think that the easy 350 is always going to be part of my rotation in some capacity like even if I don't wear 350s as much as I used to there's still an incredibly practical comfortable and easy to throw on pair of shoes and I Still Rock Mine on a regular basis and now that it's summertime and I'm wearing shorts like 90 of the time I think this is a great pair of shoes to have they look great with a pair of shorts and they're just easy to slip on and go now as for sizing on this pair of shoes well it is definitely tight so it's a very similar thing to the belugas when we had this restock basically any of these kind of OG 2016 knit style 350s are a lot tighter than some of the more recent releases where you have a thinner slightly stretchier knit so kind of the general rule of thumb for almost any 350 with the sply stripe that's on the side I would go up at least a half a size and some people even go a full size up I mean personally I went with my true to size on this specific pair and it is definitely tight like I'm definitely gonna need a half size up to be comfortable and the tightness is mainly around in the toe box that's where you feel your toes really constricting because it kind of tapers off and narrows towards the top yeah I like this colorway a lot more than I thought I would I'm definitely going to be chucking this into the rotation once I let it air out a little bit because these things are strong but guys easy season is officially here there is a bunch happening a bunch of different sneaker models releasing hopefully you managed to grab whatever you're trying to grab and I'll keep you guys updated on all the future Yeezys that are going to be dropping around the corner but I want to know from you guys what do you think of the dark Beluga do you manage to get these things let me know your thoughts down in the comment section but that about wraps it up if you want to get a full rundown on the 10 most hype sneakers that are going to be dropping in June that video is right over there,2025-06-23 14:51:46.823537 UTC
uW-OsKpQncM,Stan Smith,YouTube what is that what y'all today this isn't he'll be a fella this is Neoga fella good fella Neil coming through guys had a brain fart brain hiccup only reason why I said my name front were some backwards like that is because it was supposed to be just like how my channel is good fella Neil basically that's me on IG button on Twitter I end up putting my name in Reverse because I end up something end up happening to my original account good felony oh man so I ended up coming up with Neoga feller so every time I say good fella now when uh you know when YouTube you know above a block y'all get it plus - I'm just a good fellow man not like mob but excuse me guys not like mob but you know what I mean just so I got a pair of kicks today guys oh man where do I get these from adidas itself that whole April deal where you can put in the April code and then get 20 or 30% off definitely worth it to me I think damn yeah already been walking around in these though cuz y'all know how I like to do it man I like to I like to walk around the kicks are give you guys a better review and you know I like seeing a kid kicks crispy white or whatever y'all know me man I don't beat my kicks or anything but you know the the bottoms are do got the dirt now but when I first got him it was crispy clean all white but more into this though this is not like the first review of the Stan Smith or whatever so that's my kick I got right here and the color right here I know it get kind of funny you know obviously it's white and it's lush red and reason why I'm saying the actual exact red because they got a scarlet and they got a varsity red or something like that too so with my Stan Smith I end up I suggest going at least a half size down minimum because they do fit kind of big I'm gonna just say this whatever you wearing adidas superstar to that's what you should get for the Stan Smith personally I like a snug fit this sneaker is one of old school sneakers that that that fit kind of like big and that's from back in the day you know this kind of like oversized in a way so you know it's definitely essential to get your size easily one of the top of tennis sneakers of the summer and spring and stuff like that I'm gonna try to get a countdown out for you guys though I might do a small spring um and then do the summer one separate cuz me I like the way different colors hitting off that stuff you know what I mean so yeah that's how I feel about it but y'all know how I do man if you're already building this channel and stuff got two of my life so in a day so that's why I was looking like extra bright white but imma hold this up to the camera so you guys can see the full blown detail but um y'all know what I do man imma just go over brief review overview of the sneaker as far as the materials and what I think and then you know we could talk a little bit about it afterwards you know I'm making my two cents this one shouldn't be too much longer because this is like an instant classic there's a no-brainer a lot of original ones you know got the gremlin but they got so many different colorways now they got the royal blue navy blue everything man so they even swapped out the sold on the field actually put boost at the Bible of a few of them or whatever if you can actually find them in they have the velcro one they just like ramada five this shoe a lot if you can't find those so first thing first just for the people in my channel you got those throwback cotton laces now this is not the typical lace that we're used to this is like that throwback 70s 80s kind of like based lace and I think these came out in the 70s or the 80s don't quote me on that guys I only just looked up a little bit about it there's not that much information you know a lot of you know a lot of blogs is real basic or whatever they just say oh yeah get these adidas that's coming out they white and red here guy was on one foot and that's basically and maybe I saw what people are into but since I'm were so like the history of a sneaker and the reasons why you know what I mean the cultural significance and the difference and the progression or we made them create this stuff you know so I I personally like that kind of like stuff but uh so of course you got to endorse by Stan Smith and I always think about the Stan Smith from American Dad - I know they made a version with him as well so yeah I don't know if you can actually see that but yeah this is face right there and that lush red and then going to the leather right here you got like a tumble leather it's not like super premium but it's good enough that like if you wear this leather long enough it will break it and be nice and plush and in due time with this kind of sneaker fellas one of the things that really happened with these kind of sneakers especially these older sneakers like this is that this this will actually start to lemonade down here this minute so we actually started yellowing I welcome to character with fly colors guys I mean it makes the sneaker look more better I like that vintage look you know long as we just keep the uppers clean I know some people can't stand it you know they want to see that crispy white to each's own but I like that crispy off-white eggnog colorway with a clean up or two so it could give us some character man nothing's more better than character on it most cakes not all not all some of them do look hideous once the characters start coming in I say like something like the Concours I know those get like yellow in the mesh park and I know a lot of people they do look kind of you know like they've been pistol in a little bit or somebody spilled lemonade on them but it's quite possible that those can aged okay if they start the hill with just a little bit but other nectow like older sneakers like this though look beautiful once they start they look beautiful now with the all-white but you know once they start aging it's gonna really look fly going to the inside those on the end so we do got the lush red as well obviously you guys could see you got a clean tic-tac white toe box preparations on the side obviously to the back you got that leather Stan Smith and that's basically it going to the bottom of the soul you don't have too much traction now I've read up about this as well and you also got the that embossed or engraved adidas with the trefoil side now I've also read up about this being tennis sneakers as well probably for the 70s and 80s obviously looking at these because the tech is not that advanced on this one compared to later retros the sneakers late 80s 90s and stuff like that going to the inside though you do got like a leather sock liner this is one of those everybody sneakers like the sneaker kind like the converse allstar joints like the adidas superstar twos almost damn near is this sneakers almost about as common as a canvas sneaker so and this is where I feel like the Jordan one is gonna be if they keep pumping out the colorways eventually it's just gonna be that standard household name sneaker now everybody know what the Jordan Whitney is now but like with them coming out with all these crazy colorways it's gonna get down like this you know I don't want to say watery in a bad way but not water down in a bad way but it's gonna be no no but not too much else though guys do got the size on the back and do got my adidas superstar 2 right here just as not necessarily a too much of a comparison because I got these some time ago years ago probably in the early 2010's barolay Steve's or my sneaker Channel when this channel rather and yeah and that's probably one of my this probably one of my most popular videos and be bar lacing I have to turn the comments off on that because some people that can't bar lace or they you know they can't do it they you know they get pissed off and start up to you know start messing up the video you know what I mean they get mad after you know they get mad at they get mad at me for no reason it's like I'm teaching them how to do something you know trying to help but anyway as far as comparisons go as far as the leather quality the leather quality when the Stan Smith feels better than an adidas superstar she'll toe joints these are classic and as you can see at one point they were all yellow and cameras probably looking all yellow but when you actually see these in person Mies in particular are starting to get off-white welcome to color but the only thing about this I actually got these in a size 10 instead of a size 9 so I don't know guys might be up on the chopping block soon I like the sneaker it's just that sometimes it's just a it fits a little too too boxy long like you know because this older sneaker with like that old mold from like the pink to 80s the whole Run DMC I honestly think about with this so so yet so these sneakers are damn near the same but as far as like weight and everything this is a little bit more lighter and this is a little bit more heavier obviously I think people actually use the hoop in these and these obviously with these being tennis sneakers it's a little bit more light footed you can almost run in them and as far as comfort guys before I get up out of here the comfort when these are actually pretty decent straight out the box I'll probably give up oh wow seven and a half to eight I know right kind of high for the older sneaker but they didn't pump the tech up with this or you know the quality in this is definitely there as far as cushion I don't really too much have the aches and pains or anything walking around in this I've only walked in these for maybe like a few days but the break-in time I think was they breaking it gonna get a lot more comfortable and getting more emotive to the foot as far as rating I give these two just overall rate in as far as like being classic 10 being like the highest of 1 being the lowest out of 10 I'll give these because I think I'm I like them even more in time which they break in out of 10 I give them a solid solid 9 this is one of sneakers that you can actually wear with a little bit of everything dressing up dressing down whatever whatever even shorts if you want to go that route you this is one of everybody kind of like sneakers again like I said you could wear some prep clothing and still pull these off it's not like a big chunky boxy sneaker obviously you guys can see but this lower cut there's more low subtle cut a place that doesn't even really too much allow like sneakers all like that like as far as like a corporate environment now I'm not talking about soups or everything but I'm saying like more so like a casual environment you don't want to you know you probably don't want to wear a high tops or nothing like that but these are more Soto and more like low key so expect to see these on like one of my list soon but uh definitely worth it for the dollars you know you can always get these for a little less than $60 $50 $40 sometimes 30 if you can find a deal these too much never go over like a hundred unless there's something special in them or something but yeah so again you could wear this low you know low key prep casual I know the PO prep thing not in right now but uh if you dress up for work for those people that are still going to work around this time you know and you're allowed to actually wear casual clothing or whatever this is definitely be a nice pickup comfort level is there you won't have to kick these joints off you you know in case you got to walk around the office not the biggest deal you can go to the water cooler all that and come right back and everything could be fine man you won't be in pain so I remember I were somewhat um Bose at one time when I was working a corporate at one point not to get in trouble or anything but when wearing a sneaker like this versus of my Tumbo you know you know that sneaker is a big you know it's a hot top that you know that's heavy rather I'm gonna just say that it's more so heavy so tell me what you guys think all day classic the classics are still out there fellas you can steal Venessa deal Vanessa fit all that stuff guys different colorways so don't just subject yourself to only just one you might want to pick up multiple pairs regular people that's not sneakerheads also like these as well definitely a nice pair of clean kicks you know this go up there with bands converses adidas superstars those timeless odor kicks that's just really not gonna go nowhere because they're already staples and regular people Footwear in their closets and stuff like that so enough of my rambling guys rate comment subscribe I like to thank everybody's been watching my videos and you've been watching this to the end we're coming to subscribe I'm out peace,2025-06-19 08:39:27.397999 UTC
t-5HC5BDjEU,on cloudmonster 2,[Applause] e [Applause] [Applause] oh hey guys I'm alist from Trail and kale and this is my on cloud monster 2 review so I've already been running in shoes super excited about this one because young Cloud monster one the original made its way to the number one spot on my best on running shoes so I really wanted to know how this shoe Cloud monster 2 compared to that one now so far it's very different um now I wouldn't say it's better or worse it's just a very different shoe and I'll go into that a little bit more in just a moment so if you haven't heard of Trail and kale before real website dedicated to helping you run your best so whether that's through our training plans our running 101 advice or our running shoe reviews just like this one you're going to get better at running that's our plan and that's what will happen I promise okay I'm going to go over some of the key stats now then the shoe weighs 10.2 o it's a bit heavier than the previous version there is a 6 mm drop from Heel To Toe still I really like the drop but now who's a running shoe for and what type of shoe is it well it's still a Tempo running shoe but it doesn't have that bouncy crazy Max cushion feel it's kind of much more balanced now and there's more support So if you recall from my previous review of yon Cloud monster there was quite a lot of lateral roll um and it was super bouncy it was super super fun shoe there was nothing like it but now it just feels a lot safer and there's nothing that really stands out as an epic shoe it just feels like every other support shoe I guess you'd say um one thing I will note though it is much wider than a previous version and it is a wide shoe so if you have wide feet you should be good with this shoe and those with wide feet will be very happy to hear that I'm sure if you're enjoying this review please give it a like and consider subscribing to our channel for more running shoe reviews just like this one and if you're familiar with a Cloud monster you've run in it before this one or the previous version drop a comment down below I want to know what your thoughts on that shoe okay I'm ready to form an opinion the good and the bad let's start with a good start with the upper super bathable really like it the lacing system cinches up really well here as you saw from a previous clip of me first putting them on they do up really nicely um and like I said super bable very lightweight mesh upper so really like what I've done there now the next one could be seen as good could be seen as bad that's the width of the shoe they are wide so if you've got wide feet you're going to love that obviously I got ft and it's quite roomy in there maybe a bit too much for me uh it feels like my feet are moving around a little bit inside the shoe not a deal breaker just not the best fit so if you do have medium width feet I would consider dropping down a half size now next point is the outsa hopefully you saw that before I fell over the outsa has a much shallower Gully so I'll be running on gravel and tarmac and I haven't picked up any Stones yet on the gravel so that's definitely Improvement all right let's quickly jump to the bad so the tongue has no loop on it and that does mean that it will slip down look you can already see here the tongue has slipped and I can pull that back up that seems like a huge oversight from on um little bit disappointing there didn't get that problem on the previous version either secondly just doesn't feel as bouncy and quite as fun as the previous version um that's what I loved about the cloud monster and I'm going to have to relegate it from the top spot because of that it just feels a lot safer uh it's more stable and got more support so that's a good thing if you need a stability shoe but I Lov the cloud monster cuz it was different it was bouncy there was nothing else like it but I don't have the bounce anymore the mid sole is much firmer feels a little bit heavier as well um but you know what it's still a very good shoe it's just not a cloud monster and that disappoints me a little bit hey look who it is hey sebie enjoy all right I'm going to close out this video before the sunlight goes completely right get my breath who they for well if you're looking for a stable platform stability is running shoe that's wide has a nice light breathable upper um and a responsive midsole and by the way the grip's pretty good I've been running in some wet areas after our Deluge that we've been having in California I'm going to say they're a responsive well balanced midso I'm not going to call them maximum cushion like the on running website might want you to believe it's really not at all it's well balanced but it's not Max cushioned yes there's a you know pretty decent stack height in there and your feet are protected from that but you don't get that plush cushioning bounce field like you did in the original now is it worth the money do they present good value for money well for $180 I've got to say no unfortunately they're not they're on cloud monster the original version totally different shoe uh so you're paying for a more safe shoe and if I was price it I would put it at probably $140 $150 so that means you should probably go out and buy the original version of a cloud monster now whilst they're still around um and I will also list some alternative running shoes in the description down below for you to go check out as well well thanks for watching I really hope you enjoyed this review give it a like if you did enjoy it

different versions and the variation is basically there's a little more cushion a little more padding a little more quality so they're marketed to be so and a little more expensive these shoes ended up costing me 70 bucks now this is a vulcanized shoe but with the pop kush insult and apparently it's supposed to be a thicker sole i'm not doing too much jumping but i am running out of some pretty big bulls and so far running out of the bowls i haven't had any big problems with them and breaking them in is what i liked right away like honestly i didn't have to do too much breaking them in there was no microwave technique what the microwave technique is stick them in the microwave like 30 seconds it softens everything up but these are really soft out of the gate they look like they'd be really stiff because they're so black on the insole but honestly i can skate them right out of the box this shoe does have the original waffle outsole and it has the dura cat future so i have skated the vans classic old schools and this is sort of like a revamped version of that shoe the cosmetics of it are definitely different like there's a nice shiny sole but similar there might be a little more different materials in there for the marketing sake but honestly they skate somewhat of the same i think they're easier to break in that is the one thing normally vans are really hard to break in i think these are easier to break in but that could also mean that they rip faster so i don't know we'll see how they last over a month or so but after the first session they're holding up really good [Applause] if i had to compare them to the original band shoes that i've skated before i would say i like these better just because they look cooler as far as the material goes on this shoe i think it looks cooler but as far as it feels and functions it's pretty much the same shoe i think they just revamped how it looks on the outside everything else functions the same as the other shoe that i've skated as much as a revamp i don't know how much it really is revamped more than it is just remarketed it's kind of like when someone drops an album and they like remastered what i try to do is test a kickflip i feel like that's like every skater kind of just does that test to kick and see how does it work my first kid flipping these shoes was really good surprisingly i didn't do a lot of kick flips did a few in between the sessions and breaking these in and they flipped really good i didn't have any problems even with the dark soul i wonder if those will be extra sticky but they weren't they flipped really good i don't jump down big stair sets or anything like that but i am jumping out of tall transition running out of transition can be pretty impactful into your feet with these so far impact was great didn't feel any hill breezes i will say they're not super thick running out of big bowls all day long you're probably gonna be sore your feet are gonna be sore at the end of the day but this quick session it wasn't too bad jumping down some stairs might feel a little bit different it's not so much the impact of when you're falling down onto the transition but it's the impact of running because a lot of times your toes are digging into the shoes like when you're skating a big ditch or something like you're you're having to stop yourself so your feet are sliding into the front of your shoe and plus it's like session one once i feel like it would be kind of pretty biased to be like yeah they're like super strong because like i've only skated in one day like let's be honest i really like these shoes because i feel like i can wear when i'm not skating too i always want a good skate shoe but if i can like not be skating and go on a date night afterwards and still be looking fly that's pretty cool and i think these shoes definitely accomplished that for me i wear a size 10 in shoes and my feet are a little bit wider than i think the average person making vans good for me because they do have a little bit of a wider shoe where i think if you have a narrow foot you can still slip into them and still fit but these really cup around my feet make you feel like nice and locked into the shoe for me these shoes did fit true to size this is the first breaking in session with these shoes i've only been skating them for a few hours my honest opinion on them is i really like them if you want to get this shoe really it's up to you they're probably gonna skate just like any other vans that you've had before they're not much different than van's previous old school pro all right all you beautiful people i hope you enjoyed this video make sure you go subscribe to my channel there'll be a little link down below and make sure you subscribe to christian's

zWVBeWuyZ4s,Stan Smith,[Applause] hey what's up everybody welcome back to another shoe review and today I have the updated Stan Smith shoe in 2024 so you can see the box right here it says in plastic waist a traditional Adidas logo shoe boxes right here right there and this is a lifestyle shoe so it's a size 12 stand Smith this thing retail for $100 so yeah I got this at the outlet so yeah so I got it for a good deal so let's open up this the most iconic shoe you can get from the Adidas so where you can see and let's take it out nothing special it just says n plastic waist Globe right there very hard to see but yeah nothing special with the box of this shoe and this shoe speaks for itself so you look watch my other review of this shoe I had the navy blue one and I have like the vegan leather kind of uh stance smth so I'm going back to with the traditional uh leather type of um stance SMI and you can see the quality is not the same anymore I think the old one the quality is pretty good until they do the end plastic waist one I don't know because the Plastics mixing some kind of thing inside the shoe but yeah you can still see the the design you can see a little um circles on the bottom for traction with the Adidas logo right there and this is the lifestyle logo okay so St Smith say St Smith in the back and yeah St Smith the guy and he's famous for his tennis skills just like Michael Jordan is famous for his basketball shoes so we're saying right here endorsed by Stan Smith with his face right there and his signature so that's pretty cool I think the green one is the most classic one you could find and yeah this thing is expensive $100 they go up to $100 now so you can see this is size 12 us and yeah let's look at the insole of the shoe and they kind of glue it down really well but you can see it's just a foam shoe and it's really stuck in here the glue really well you can see this blue foam and if you're not used to the cushioning system uh or you guys used to the modern cushioning system uh they have Boost they have zumax zoom Nike Air Max if you're into like cushioning shoes this is not sh the shoe for you these for a reserve for people who are into the lifestyle no technology whatsoever in the shoe so yeah it's a lifestyle shoe and look at the shoe laes so I about the shoe is for the iconic look not for the performance so yeah it's pretty thick flat shoe lace right here with the flat tip and let me see if I can take the inso out of the shoe it doesn't feel like the classic one it feels like they mix the leather it's feel more plasticky now not as leathery like before and you can totally feel it and yeah so if you guys look at the Adidas right now now they got the shoe retail for $100 but right now it's on sale for $60 so that's pretty cool and it says it's like best seller on the website but the size are very limited you have small sizes but the larger size like me size 12 were pretty much gone so you want the Sho you have to go with some weird colorway like you can see right there it's kind of hard to get like the bigger SI size so everything's bigger size you can get a size 13 which is too big for me but yeah and yeah then Adidas change the shoe you know they try to be more sustainable save plastic and everything but this shoe have been around for like 15 years you believe that um very iconic and it's fresh um you know it's fresh no matter what you look good in white shoes and they these committed to um recycle polyester so they mix it with the vegan stuff so yeah the shoe is not the same and yeah but this is the only thing you can get now so you know not the same shoe as before but yeah I'm not complaining I'm just stating the fact but you can see the Stan Smith very iconic right there but yeah I really love this shoe so this is my third pair and compared with the other I iconic shoe which is the fast break Pro this is more of a por performance shoes than a lifestyle shoe because it's made for basketball and for skateboarding and I love how this shoe has this thick foam inso compared to the Adidas stmi let me try to take it out and show you guys look how thick the insole is compared to the Adidas you see that how thin this one is and how thick this one is look at that big size comparisons and yeah um if you stand for a long time if you work in the shoes you could probably be fatigued so I'll go with like um another insole more something with more polyurethane for the shoe so I'm going to put the shoe on and see how it looks like on my feet all right guys you saw on my feet um yeah the shoe uh doesn't feel the same but um it has the touch from the outside but the feel of putting the shoe on is still the same just like the Original Classic because of the same design and everything um yeah it's true to size the width is perfect so if you size 12 just go stick with your own size so you don't have to go half size up or down or anything um yeah I like the thick shoelaces and the iconic look but yeah um the traction is pretty good um this this used to be a tennis shoe I guess you can still play tennis with this but uh it's more of a lifestyle shoe now so yeah um of course you can do other stuff like going to gym walking exercise with it no problem at all the only thing is there's no cushioning system uh years ago I believe they had the Boost St Smith which I couldn't get which I really wanted but I couldn't uh the mid on the bottom is like boost so it's pretty good um too bad I didn't get it um that's my regret but yeah this shoe is um pretty good the the panel when you feel it's made with recycle um material so it's more vegan now so it's not leather anymore so these trying to move away from animal uh products and material so yeah the feel is not the same if you with the touch so if you like the original leather I think you just have to find an old pair and do a soul swap or something and uh yeah and uh the bottom is made with 50% um recycled content because adid is trying to end plastic Wass that's why it is and my last pair of um vegan Adidas this all this start cracking because I don't know why um I didn't wear it that much and I store it when I start wearing it started cracking on me so yeah which is too bad and the white shoe like this is easy to get dirty so what I um thing you guys should do is spray some clear protector for shoes just to protect your shoes from getting yellowing and getting dirt on there because I don't know how this thing will stain will affect the shoe cuz I know the leather one's pretty good with the stain but I don't know about the vegan so yeah and what you guys think of this shoe and this is the only thing we can get so yeah I can't go back to like the olden days where you get like premium product but uh yeah this is one of the best iconic shoe ever I really love it and this is my third pair and yeah I can't go wrong with it but yeah right now it's on sale so just go to Adidas and grab a pair or a Foot Locker or other shoe store that you like yeah so if you like my video please smash the like button if you haven't hit subscrib please hit the Subscribe button don't forget to hit the Bell icon to get future

6E6IlDh-rNo,Veja Esplar,[Applause] in this video I'm going to share with you my thoughts and review on v s sakers first of all I discovered about this brand V when I saw princess Katherine Katherine Princess of Wales wearing them um on a few occasions and she was wearing them with casual and bit of casual bit of former clothes as well I saw her wear them with jeans um casual uh pants and match with Blazer and she looks absolutely gorgeous this particular style is called es in whites and platin it has metallic rose gold colored logo and heel panel with the brand name on it so let's talk about the look first of all I think it look classy and neat clean and there's just something about it that's a bit feminine simple but elegant at the same time color is white and it gives that fresh and clean look and the logo is rose gold metallic so it gives that um classy at the same time fun um but that type of metallic rose gold metallic is not that that bright it's quite subtle and um classy looking you can pair it with outfits like casual and formal and you can wear them with jeans uh casual pants summer dresses skirts when it comes to cleaning it's easy to wipe I just wipe it with baby wipes and it's easier to clean quickly when it gets dusty when it comes to comfort I have wide feet and wearing them felt really comfortable I didn't have to break them in as soon as I wore them I just walked went out and yeah I didn't have to break them in and they felt really comfortable so I walked in them continuously for about 2 months traveling with my young children and they didn't hurt at all they're actually really comfortable they're the only pair of sneakers that I brought with me from home to the airport and to a travel destination yeah they're really comfortable it has a subtle um cushion effect but it's not that cushiony um where you can feel like your bouncy but it's it's just the right amount of support it's not hard or it's not that um too soft either so it just kind of just hugs my feet and it felt like a glove some other reviewers or other people talked about the shoe tongue coming out rubbing against the um front ankles I'm but for me it wasn't the casee I thought they were comfortable I thought they were soft and the tongue naturally just goes to the side slightly and they didn't rub at all so after wearing my veger shoes I thought they were very comfortable that um I have um another pair of sneakers the St Smith um Adidas and after wearing Vega sneakers I don't feel like going back to wearing my St Smith although I still love them but for now I'll be wearing the vure as PL Snickers for a while cuz I just love them I think it's true to its size um I bought the size 37 size 37 a European size that size I bought I thought it was perfect thanks for watching this video and I hope you find it very helpful if you have any questions or comments leave them down in the comments section below I will read all your comments and I appreciate your taking time to being here like And subscribe and I hope to see you soon thank for watching bye,2025-06-23 14:57:43.741819 UTC
JZOoDlrgDks,Adidas Gazelle,a,2025-06-23 14:39:02.838543 UTC
lYBZEO4Q8Zs,Yeezy 350 v2,a brand new yeezy 350 drop today and this is the slate color whip this is the first new 350 in a while and i wanted to try them out so let's see how they are they come in your classic 350 box and are a 350 v2 these do not have a pull tab on the back but do have a solid black stripe and gray colored upper but i actually thought they looked pretty clean right out of the box and were definitely better than the stock pictures online of course you get the boost on the outsole and the yeezy branding on the inside of the shoe but when i went to get these laced up i thought about how kanye appears very unhappy with adidas on social media right now but even still,2025-06-23 14:51:47.548389 UTC
sB8QX5_CJqk,Nike Air Max 90,a quick comparison of the Nike Air Force Ones to the air max90s this is size seven this is size 7 and a half the tops are mesh right here but this one has the dot and the leather but it does dent a little bit more this one's made for running this one's made for walking but of course you can walk in both of them,2025-06-23 11:26:33.961819 UTC
Wrnkykah6wc,Adidas Samba,all of these brands are doing like twists on Classics we just did the air more Up Tempo how they with those and made them kind of cooler in my opinion and Adidas doing the same thing man they took the samba which is already you know it's a cool shoe I think it's all right it's a little too thin for me but they beefed the out of it and hot damn this reminds me of 2000 skate era stuff this is awesome hey what's going on guys my name is Chris welcome back to the official wear testers.com YouTube channel today we got a detailed look and breakdown of these bad boys right here this is the Adidas Samba xlg they smell so good if you just had these in your hand so you could touch and feel the leather that's on this for 110 bucks you would go and grab your nearest Air Jordan one and just Chuck it in the trash it's crazy seriously same Tech and everything now before we Deep dive into these guys real quick we do have a quick word from today's sponsor and that's the good folks over at Soul premise Soul premise offers a great variety of travel bags that are designed and built with sneer heads in mind the carry-on travel backpacks can fit up to five pairs of shoes or if you're a light packer one pair of shoes since you're already wearing one while you're traveling which leaves you with a ton of space for all of your other belongings and yes these bags are TSA approved they fit in the overhead compartment I've have tried this many times and it works successfully the travel day packs fit up to two pairs of sneakers they even have toilet tree bags cross body bags and my personal favorite the sports bag I use that every day when I go to the gym it fits my backup pair my testing pair and then another testing pair along with all of my other stuff gum water bottles change of clothes sometimes my camera you never know what might be in that thing it's like Mary poppet bag it's amazing you can use our promo code that you see on the screen right now to save yourself up to 40% on your purchase with the link Down Below in our description box you're welcome in advance all right so first off these guys we already established are 110 bucks super affordable I'm sure that you can find certain colorways available right now for under that I actually just grabbed another colorway it's more of the classic Samba version so it's just the white with the black stripes and actually got 30 bucks off of those things I can't remember where I'm pretty sure it was WSS it's actually where I got these from too I grabbed this pair in store and uh when you sign up for their like you know the program or whatever you like accumulate points and I got 30 bucks off so yeah actually it might have been full longer actually I think it was dicks yeah what's going on with my brain why can't I remember anything anymore like what's happening at least you realize that you're forgetting it pisses me off I normally remember everything so delete all that I'm pretty sure or does it it doesn't even matter it doesn't matter at all it doesn't even matter I don't know why I get stuck on this stuff what am I even talking about you haven't even said the cutest part what about getting these shoes what about them you had a father daughter bonding moment oh they don't care it was still cute I got to witness it how was it cute because I just took her shopping I know and she paid for her own St she paid for her own stuff I was proud of she didn't even attempt to ask if we would pick up the check she bought two pairs know she bought these and the campuses she got the color W of these that I wanted so you can be T I think over at Dicks now I'm confused you guys didn't see any of that stuff hopefully hopefully I hope not I said delete it so yeah we'll see what happens but anyways where do I go from here I'm not sure how about we just start at the bottom so these guys actually feature the same traction pattern as the regular version of the Samba but it's attached to this bigger chunkier cupsole so the original version is also a cupsole but that is actually or at least it was originally an indoor performance shoe for the game of football also known as soccer if you're here in the States this one not so much this looks like aing skate shoe bro like this I love it I think that this is the coolest damn thing I think I've seen in a hot minute from Adidas not from the basketball side like just from lifestyle perspective but yeah this cupsole is awesome it's thick it's gum rubber which ising great and again this outsole is based off of the original performance outsole so I think that's really cool too it's paying homage to its Heritage without leaving anything behind you know what I mean like this is not a cheaper version of the shoe or a dumb down version of the shoe if anything this is kind of a better version of the original I just think it's crazy and again that thick chunky cupsole is awesome it looks great and inside of that cupsole is an Eva wedge that's the one thing where they'll differ from something like the air Jord one like something that's similar to this you know what I mean but can you feel that air so unit that's inside of the cupole of an Air Jordan 1 the answer is no so yeah I think that tech for tech when we're comparing this to like an Air Jordan 1 there's really no contest this blows that shoe out of the water I'm talking about the OG low version of the Jordan 1 to I'm not even talking about the cheap version of the Jordan 1 that retails close to this one like around that 110 to 120 range like those are not even comparable to these material wise like those feature garbage leather this features real leather I can't believe what that brand gets away with now the materials on these are just amazing for their price so the materials are not premium by any means but it's very nice leather you can smell it it's again not premium but it's real that's a real Cow's Ass right there wrapped around that last and it's awesome the overlays are going to be all different depending on the color way this particular one features suede on the stripes as well as the toe you also have a little bit of suede right there at the rear this is cool as too this little rib thing this is also pointing towards Adidas's Heritage like if you go towards their uh Continental 80s and stuff like that like very similar dude it looks it ad does some of the best work with their own design language than maybe any brand hot take maybe but I'm talking about like when you look at an Adidas you know it's an Adidas but yeah all the materials on here are fantastic there's multiple different colorways all of them are a little bit different some of them are better some of them are just again different some are all sueded everything like I saw all black pair that's actually the first pair of these that I noticed I saw them on shelves at a Shoe Palace and I picked them up like immediately cuz they again remind me of skate shoes dude they remind me of like some Globes or some DCS and I was like bro these are sick what is this you know what I mean like it was dope and they were just a straight up all black suede upper fire I'm in love I'm in love and I don't care who knows it now they also switched up the tongue but again still playing up their Heritage so if you remember in our other Samba video like the actual Samba I had noted that there's multiple different tongue versions of that shoe some are performance- driven some are lifestyle driven this is kind of a blend of both so it's got the ribs on there that is like the performance version of the tongue but it's shaped more like the lifestyle version and then on top of that they puffed it up again kind of like a skate shoe and with today's fashion trends moving more towards that late '90s early 2000s aesthetic with you know the baggy clothes and stuff like that you know making it comeback this just fits right in with all that stuff I think it's a great move the inside liner is the one thing that I don't love this particular one is that vinyl material I I just don't like it it doesn't feel good on your skin if you happen to wear no shows and then on top of that it doesn't last very long like this type of material is inside of a lot of my original rebok Iverson shoes and that stuff just it deteriorates like crazy so not my favorite thing I wish it was just a regular liner but outside of that that's really my only complaint that's High Praise is the insole a piece of well yes it is it's also really heavily glued in there so it's hard for me to get out so I'm just going to leave it but if you can take it out you can replace it with anything else that you'd like as far as sizing is concerned they do fit true to size so whatever you typically wear that is what I would recommend grabbing I would highly recommend going in store somewhere I seen these all over the place whether it be Foot Locker Dick Sporting Goods WSS or again I got these and any other like chain retailer they should have something like this on shelves just try it on see if you like it that's what I did I kept seeing them and being like Oh those are cool those are cool those are cool it took me like five times to try them on and then I finally was like wow these are dope but with all that being said what's today's question of the day what is the scariest weirdest story jod has ever told you it might have been the shark one that one sticks out in my mind like I think about this regularly and I shouldn't about that specific story about it going into the the river and then eating children we covered this in our podcast I can throw up the thumbnail here but you had told me about it before the podcast too and I don't like that like I just I just don't like it man I I already don't like going into the ocean I know that they could wash them up on shore and just you know got you like all that I don't like it and the fact that they could get into fresh water and be like cool you know I'm just like dude I just don't with that stuff man I just don't that is for real like that can really happen well that was the whole point of the history of that was prior to those five attacks Americans thought sharks were like dolphins like completely harmless wrong you know what I mean like man yeah like it's just crazy to think that like like you're already not safe in the ocean but like to think that they can like you know come up on just especially if your river is kind of murky like the Sacramento River is not clean that's the thing also in those stories uh the shark was spotted a couple times even by the people who were attacked their brains could not comprehend a shark being in the river so their brains went and said oh that's a log yeah something else yeah that's what I'm saying like mm just the thought of it gives me theing heebie jeebies we like I'm like I don't want to go anywhere in people ask me all the time you want to go to the river no I know he humors me and goes to the lake like one per year and I don't even like that when we go to the beach he walks to the water's edge and is like I'm cool y That's pretty you know what I mean like I don't with that stuff man like it's just it's not for me yeah I'm a land mammal period when I was really little I've always wondered but I don't know how to maybe maybe somebody on here will know it my parents watched a movie I want to say it was kind of in black and white and there was some crazy in my brain it's black and white okay but the scene that I remember seeing up on the TV was and I'm pretty sure it was a shark it could have been a whale and it was not Pino it was a liveaction movie but they had this creature had swallowed multiple people and the people to stay alive were floating inside of Barrels in this large fish's stomach and I don't know what movie it is that had to have been a whale and that kind of sounds familiar but I don't know what it's not Pinocchio I promise everybody it's not Pinocchio I don't know you know you know what movie this is a tangent but what movie really me up from from water like before the shark thing was piranhas bro I've never seen that yeah like that like they was in a swimming pool I don't even know how they got in there but it was not cool to watch and I was a very little kid and I was like never ever so yeah but anyways what was the question oh it was a okay it was a personal sorry my bad thank you so much for being here thank you so much for hanging out with us we greatly appreciate it we catch you guys in the next one so until then yall have a good one I got so sidetracked by everything look at this hoodie bro it's so fire did you want to see it up close real quick look at how premium just the Garment is alone and then you got this jersey style like stitched on there and then the colors pop oh my goodness it's so good it's almost hoodie season it since apparel stay tuned,2025-06-19 08:41:00.345482 UTC
5aofM5aq8KI,Nike Dunk Panda,all right guys what's going on welcome back to the challenge but t right here man yo we got another sneaker video for you now these sneakers we're gonna show you today is a sneaker that came out last year back in march and i must say when they restock people still get wild about them and if you know what i'm talking about they are the nike dumb low panda panda panda panda this is music all right so let's jump in the box man here we go man we got this nice orange nike box they got nike on the front nike on the side and as you can see your rocks the size 10 which is true to size it's hot rock all my sneakers um with these with these sneakers here i don't i don't see you happening to you know go up a size half size anything like that um i would say true to size you'll be absolutely fine if you have never owned a pair of ducks all right so let's just jump right into it here we go we have the nike dunk low panda right here in our hands and listen like i said before man these released back in march of 21 and for what 110 bucks if i'm not mistaken and right now you get them now i would say majority people they get these sneakers here once they get them because when they restock so much for dunks once you get them they also be sold down for about almost 180 maybe some 200 man the resell on them is ridiculously crazy but yeah let's just jump right into this here man everybody notice the the nice smooth looking colorway which is a black and white silhouette style colorway so we have the black going through your front of the toe box and it just goes up all the way through the tongue to the uppers of the sneaker which again i like the black and white look i mean i mean the white can get dirty but hey man i mean hey hey you take good cavity sneakers you're gonna be all right you know i mean but yeah as you can see we got the black going on the back of the hill sneaker and as you look in the colors on the sneaker as well we have the black one which i just i'm a knack for black i love it and then you got the black you get the black emblem with the white nike chick with a nike symbol as well and you just can't beat that then you jump into your white that's going throughout this as you can see on the sole of the sneaker you have the white you have the white in the mids of it you also have the white toolbox right along with the white tongue and like i said the white nike emblem as well and again if you turn to the back you got the nike as well and it's just pretty much a plain sneaker all black bottom and i love it i love it a lot man i love the light i i just like the colorway to it and that just actually this what still it sends it up for me all right as you can see the nike with the black inside with the white actual soul of the sneaker as well for the cushion and that's just your right shoulder jumping into the left you have the same exact look and i mean that means they're separate center self explanatory and you can't beat it um only thing about dunks is this one thing is this here man the thing about dunks is the leather on them is not the best quality leather and what i mean by that is this leather here is like it's like a hard leather and i mean i know a lot of people don't care about those type of leathers but you know for a true sneaker head like i said in you know people that love sneakers like i said you know the these pandas well dunks in general was literally they would literally crease up on you and for example i'm just going to show you um i actually have another pair right here which is my wife's pair which she had hers since the day it came out which was last year and if you really really look at this look at him and you can start seeing how it's starting to crease up it's starting to crease and bubble up and you know it just it just it's one of those sneakers that's why i would say that's why i said got a high resale on because i mean i'm gonna resell high restock on it i said the leather one is not the best leather and and just for one minute let me just show you how long so we grab a pair of these jordan lows right here and like i said if you can just look at the difference in the leather is like this is a sulfur see how soft that is it makes a big difference you know with that leather and just you can't you can't beat that you know but i'm at the end of the day it's still a sneaker and you can't complain about it because you know hey it's a snake you know a lot of people don't care about like the textures of the sneakers some people don't care about the quality of the snicker some people just buy it and they just get it yeah man i got it i got it which is fine i mean that's what we do that's what we have sneakers for that's what we get them so we can so we can rock them and you know to his limits but just always remember guys ladies and gentlemen if you got a pair of dunks always be sure to get some type of shoe trees to put inside of these because like i said it'll crease up on you the wear and tear on on these dumps is absolutely very fast you know they they can they can crease up very quickly so depending on how many times you wear them you will definitely start seeing them but all in all i'm not gonna complain because it's still a good sneaker it's still 110 dollars you can't beat it and i really i still like the colorways because don't bring out some amazing colorways from the unc's to the to the clemsons to a couple other pairs as well but you can't beat it but all in all man there you have it the nike dunk low pandas and again y'all truly do appreciate all the love support if you're new to the channel subscribe to the channel and don't forget the like button as well but till then i'll see you guys on the next

ALdTr7f3Aec,New Balance 990,all right so I recently picked up the New Balance 991 V2 this is the latest and greatest model from New Balance with regards to the made in the UK version sneakers retail on this is crazy though at $250 and they are a little bit scarce right now on their website however in this video I wanted to compare the very popular 990 V6 to the 991 V2 and just show you guys kind of the details up close on each of the pairs some of the things I like about one pair or the other better and hopefully you guys find this comparison video somewhat informative now if you guys want to buy either of these sneakers I will link them in the description the video as well as the other alternative which is a 991 V1 and this one is available in all sizes however the V2 is slimmer sizes and then they do have the 990 V6 in a couple different colorways but let's go ahead and transition to the other camera and get into some of the details all right so just give you guys a recap look at the 99 V1 versus the V2 here is the shoes side by side 990 V1 on this side 990 V2 as you can see on the back right here it actually says V2 the other one has the 91 there the 991 is on on the side of the V2 as you can see there there are a couple subtle differences in the midsole as you could see here the main difference is that the V2 actually features fuel cell in the midsole and the V1 does not the V1 also has a slightly shorter tongue than the V2 I actually prefer the V2 tongue a little bit better because of that also you have the made in the UK branding back here on the V1 the V2 says it's made in the UK but it actually doesn't have any like Flags or anything like that it does look very similar from the tow down however as you can see on both of the shoes kind of the panels and the layout it's fairly similar on both of the models and the 991 might be my favorite New Balance model honestly to date I just I really like the Aesthetics of what the model offers and I think it is a beautiful looking shoe and just for comparison here is a 990 V5 versus the 990 V6 so uh similarly different as you can see they kind of changed the entire thing up from the previous and uh all in all like I like the 990 V5 a lot this one was an amazing model but I just wanted to show you those side by side now here's a look at the 991 V2 versus the 990 V6 made in USA made in UK kind of the flagships of Both Worlds the made in the USA 990 V6 is the pair that was released in 2022 this pair came out in 2023 the retail on the 990 V6 is $200 and then you have a wng 250 for the V2 version of the 991 now if you don't want to pay the 250 on that you can actually go this route at $220 which is a $330 savings I think that is actually pretty decent however if you want to go with the $200 version this is the one that I would recommend there's a couple reasons why I think that this is a better model than this one and so let's go ahead and get into some of the pros and cons about each of them the first thing just comparing the tongue side by side the 990 V6 versus the 991 V2 I actually like the overall size of the tag a little bit better on the 990s because it is a little bit smaller I do like the overall structure of the 990 V2 better though however because you do have like a little bit of a fork tongue here at the top and this one is a little bit more rounded at the top and I actually like this one a little bit better just the overall placement again is just a little bit bigger than I would I also do want to point out you get more suede overall on the upper on the 991 V2 as you can see on the heel and the midfoot of the shoe there is quite a bit of suede overlays and then you do also have some of the mesh as well on the 990 v6s there is a lot more mesh uh than what I would prefer on the shoe honestly that's kind of like the bigger let down of the pair is the fact that this whole mid panel right here is just mesh uh and then you do have some accent pieces in here some uh 3M reflective materials here and there but for the most part this section right here is pretty bare of suede versus this one so if you want more of a premium feel continue you're paying a premium price for the product uh this one does have a big gap right here however this wayed hits that you do get on the heel back here as well as on the toe cap uh and the reinforcement for the laces is really nice I mean it's the New Balance suede that we do appreciate it's just a lot of price for the overall volume of suede in my opinion and even the 991 v1s you have more suede there than you do on this one so kind of a bummer but it is what it is now one thing I do like about both of the models is you do have fuel cell in the midsole of the shoe that's the blue part here that's the white part here fuel cell is one of the premium foam technologies that New Balance owns honestly I'm a little surprised they didn't do Fresh Foam X in either of them fuel cell is supposed to be the more responsive of the two uh Fresh Foam is kind of like the pillow a soft cushioned Landing uh but this one gives you a little bit of responsiveness it feels pretty good and just throwing this out there the fuel cell that you see in the elite Runners like this this is an amazing shoe the super cotton trainer 2os I did plenty of reviews if you guys haven't seen it on the channel but this stuff is crazy crazy soft squishy on feet unbelievably good uh and it's just a different foam compound even though it's called fuel cell on the midsole of this so this is still really nice really soft better than most of the New Balance 990s in my opinion however comparative to the actually running line it's not anything to really compare it this is like super super soft this is like a pretty nice Pham but that being said the experience that you get on Feed in either model here is really really good on feet in my opinion they're probably the most comfortable pairs of New Balance 990s out of the entire 990 catalog all the other models are usually pretty comfortable as well most of the people that wear 990s know that they break in and they're just overall very comfortable but the comfort with the added fuel cell definitely makes it a little bit softer underfoot but which is going to be the most comfortable out of these two that's going to be a tough one to say because if you like a little bit of firmer more substantial feel I'd think that the 991 V2s is probably that if you want something a little bit lighter and I think a little bit softer overall on feed I would go with a 990 V6 the other thing is that the V6 does come in wide and even extra wide versions so if you have an extra wide foot uh this is going to be like an amazing pair for you this is like the Action Bronson model for those people that didn't know and the 991 V2 is actually the model that stone Allen did a recent collaboration on that I struck out on and then this is the first colorway to drop now when these drop in more sizes and colorways I will link them in the description of this video just in case you're watching this from the future and they do actually have them available cuz as of right now there's a shortage in this model they're just not readily available only in very select sizes so I'll post them when they do restock you can get the 990 V6 though in a lot of different sizes colors and also widths for those people again that need the wide foot and again Link in the description if you guys would like to shop uh for New Balance and if you do use my link it does give me a little bit of a kickback and it lets New Balance know that you guys saw the video and mess with the channel and greatly appreciate when you guys do that now I did mention the weight was a little bit less so it is 12.9 Oz for the 99 V6 and that's a men's 9.5 and then in am men's 9.5 you have 14.2 Oz on the 991 V2 so a little bit heavier as I mentioned and for reference the 991 is 14.1 o also so that might be one misconception if you have added fuel cell in the midsole of the shoe does that make it a little bit lighter I mean it really doesn't make it that much lder considering the other compounds that they actually have in this midsole and outsole so the outsole traction is thick rubber I mean this thing is going to last you're going to buy these are going to be tanks they're going to last for a long period of time I would say that there is more traction there than obviously VI ly you could see here there's a little bit of a gap so I feel like the wear and tear is going to be a little bit more significant on the 990 v6s however you do still have some really thick traction here as well it's just a little bit more gapped than on the 991s now the 991s also do feature the absorb SBS pods and those help absorb shock and whatnot as you can see right here and then also in the front it's kind of nice little jelly pods here and then it also does feature end cap in the midsole I believe that is the foam uh around the outside of the shoe so it's kind of like a dual density foam you also do have something very SAR to that on the 9990 v6s you do have fuel cell as you can see down here but you also have the encap midsole cushioning for the lightweight foam uh paired with that fuel cell so dual density foam on here it's kind of fun that they're actually mixing the traditional like cut and sew pairs of sneakers like this with the modernized technology with the fuel sell my only hope is that they actually integrate some fresh foam X like this uh into this guy as well just make a even softer version just make a cloud version or something like that have it pretty much the same but a softer foam for those people that are wanting because this foam is actually much softer than the fuel cell that they have integrated in here at least in my opinion and if you haven't tried these or haven't seen a video review on these yet I recommend going checking it out this is probably one of my favorite shoes this year this is the 1080 v13 amazing amazing running shoe very very soft uh super nice casual if you're looking for an all-around walking pair of sneakers or just an all-around casual pair that's really soft on feet these things are unreal uh super super good and uh I'm happy that I got a pair of those anyways as for the toe box you see both of them have Suede and then you have the mesh uh panels here you have a little bit of a reflective hit down here in the corner on the 990s you also have a large reflective n on the 990 v6s and then you have a smaller n on the 991s also just wanted to point out the build quality inside here really nice stuff you get a very similar treatment in the 990 v6s as well now on the back of the shoe the stack height is a little bit higher it looks like on the 990 v6s over here the 990 v6s also have the made in the USA back here the made in the UK is actually underneath the tongue right here and you also do have made in the USA under the 99 v6s they did move away from like the big flags and whatnot on the models and as you can see on the 990 V5 they have the American flag here on the tongue so not really sure why they went away from The Branding of the made in the USA made in UK but it is something that they still promote as such and both models feature reflective material on the bottom of the tongue uh here and here so I like that there is minimal amounts of reflective materials but they're impactful they make a difference because they actually do work and it's something that if you're walking around the streets and whatnot outside you will be able to be seen in all different angles it makes logical sense that they have reflective details on the heel the sides and then the front of the shoe and I like that they have that all covered also the additional material underlay right here is actually a perforated suede vers is a 991 look more like leather or even synthetic leather and then just calling this out also on the midsole you can see barely but there's actually two different tones of uh color on the midsole on both sides so it is kind of nice that they actually change it up there and they do the same thing on the 990 V6 as you can see little hits of gray right here on the side and I'm not an expert on the lifestyle side of things with the foam Technologies and stuff but I feel like the gray foam back here might be endcap and then the white foam might be fuel cell instead so I can tell from just touching the Foams that the gray foam is firmer than the white foam same ones too on this pair the kind of off-white color the grayish is a little bit harder than the wider foam on the front also one other thing to note is the liner here is a little bit softer material and then you have a textured mesh here on the 990 v6s but leave a comment in the comment section which is your favorite looking model overall just pure Aesthetics of the shoe how you like them on feet the 990 v6s or the 991 V2s I mean let's be honest if we're here watching this video we're privileged enough to even like consider buying a $200 pair of sneakers plus I'm honored to be able to like do these videos for you guys and it's honestly just like a dream come true for me but it is all excess and it's all privilege and uh it doesn't make you a better person anything like that if you get like a better pair or more expensive pair of sneakers than the other people around you and so I just want to throw that disclaimer out there at the end of the day be thankful for what you have back to the video though which is uh my preference I mean honestly I do like this model it's the latest and greatest one I have had this one for a while to be fair and I have absolutely loved it the 991 V2 is a little heavier I do like the overall look the Aesthetics of the shoe and I like that extra Midol detailing that they actually feature which was something that They carried over from the previous version as well I I like it I think it looks really cool stylistically I think this is a superior model in my mind overall Comfort I would say is better and the overall functionality and wearability I would say the 990 V6 because it is widely available it's available in wide sizes and the price point is a little bit more affordable as well it's a little bit lighter also overall I think this is a tremendous pair and one that you can't go wrong with I do like the gray colorways of both of them uh but they do have other colorways of the 990 V6 for those people that are interested in again uh Link in the description much appreciate for anybody that checks those out but that's it hopefully you guys enjoy this uh video comparing the models if you guys want to see other comparisons uh like this leave a comment in the comment section let me know what models and I appreciate you all for stopping by and watching have a good rest of the day all right peace guys,2025-06-23 14:42:45.406141 UTC
ZOwtMddy6Zs,New Balance 2002R,all right so my request I wanted to do a comparison between these two popular models of sneakers uh shout out to you guys that left the comments I wanted to see this video so this is the New Balance 2002 R and this is the vomero fives from Nike and honestly I was like you guys are crazy I don't see their similarities between these two models but then of course the midsoles I was like oh yeah I get it there's a couple things that I want to show you guys similar a couple things different so let's go ahead and get into this comparison and hope you guys find this video helpful if you guys are interested in buying either model of these shoes I'll link them in the description with some options for those people looking I'll tell you guys off the bat both of these are pretty good options for 2023 even though both of them came out in previous years so let me go ahead and get in some of the history so the Nike vomero 5 actually originally released in 2011 and currently the Nike of America line is on the vomero 16 and you can buy those now again Linked In the description in 2022 and 23 we're seeing a rise of the Romero line and it's pretty cool to see honestly I never would have expected the Romero 5S to have the like cult following that it does right now the New Balance 2002 are actually originally came out in 2010 as a follow-up to the New Balance 2001 and that's the New Balance model 2001 it's kind of confusing for the original 2002 R's actually had a 250 dollar price tag so for the 2022 version that we're very familiar with this is actually not the original midsole of the 2002 R this midsole actually came from this model and I did a video review of these and explained that a little bit but this is the 860 V2 from New Balance this is a running shoe again a legacy running shoe that they decided to recycle and use this midsole on the 2002 RS giving us the current day 2002 hours that we all know and I'll tell you guys in my experience personally on both of the models they both fit true to size I'm a 9.5 and I wear a 9.5 in the vomero as well as the 2002 RS if you guys have a difference in opinion please leave a comment but I do have a little bit of a wider foot however I do know that we all have different shapes and sizes of feet so from my experience true to size on both so the question I'm sure a lot of people are asking like which one should I buy if I want to buy something trendy or retro look which do you buy the Nikes or the New Balance well honestly it's a matter of style and opinion the New Balance has a couple different things than the Nikes do and I'll go ahead and cover that right now the Romero fives typically have more mesh on the uppers of the shoe it is more of like the Retro running sneaker versus the 2002rs is more of a lifestyle sneaker with suede overlays now obviously there's different colorways and different materials on some of the models this one has a protection pack inspired extra threads and stuff on it however the regular pairs just have like Suede and leather usually also overall feel on feet which is softer more comfortable honestly if you're looking for softness and overall Comfort I would say the vomero fives do feel a little bit more comfortable than the 2002rs however the 2002rs have the rubber outsole which means that this is going to be a lot more durable than the vomeros in my opinion so for long-term durability between the two regardless of the overall Comfort the new balance is going to be more durable I think long term than the vomeros but for overall soft squishy feel on feet there's obviously better models than either of these two on the market and I've covered a lot of those videos on this channel if you guys are interested but for these two specifically Head to Head the Romeros are definitely softer and squishier on feet and that has to do with the Nike Kush lawn and the Air Zoom in the midsole of the vomeros the New Balance has the absorb midsole and then the energy cushioning and they're very comfortable as well I just don't want you to think that these are not comfortable it's just overall comparison next to each other the Nikes are a lot softer also because of all the mesh on the vomeros they definitely have the more sporty look of the two for those people wanting that so A couple of things that are undeniably similar about these shoes the first thing is obviously the back of the shoe the Rubber and foam pod heel like cushioning like this is so crazy how they kind of like borrowed that from each other so who copied who well again it's not really these models Head to Head it's this model and this model because this is the one that actually had the midsole and this came out in 2012 the Romero fives came out in 2011. so even though the 2002 R came out originally in 2010 the midsole itself came out in 2012 with the 860 V2 so that means the vimeros are actually the first to Market with this midsole style in 2011. another similarity between the two is kind of that toe up rubber placement on the front of the shoe very very similar in both exact same design another similarity between the two is the overall branding on the side panels of the shoe obviously the giant Nike Swoosh on the vomeros and the giant ends on the New Balance similar to all the other shoes that really have these New Balance always has that Nike sometimes has that on the sides as well obviously another similarity between these two is the heel collar shape like it looks very very similar on both of the shoes just something to notice and the last similarity worth noting is the plastic TPU rails underneath for support both of these shoes on the arc have that plastic TPU so very similar in design it is very interesting how similar a lot of these things are however there are a couple differences that I wanted to point out the first difference is there is a gusseted ton on the vomeros that means it's stitched down halfway through the tongue the top part is loose but the bottom part is not versus a regular tongue on the 2002rs there's no stitching on the sides another major difference between the two is the heel cup of the shoe there is a plastic TPU sort of heel cup on the vomeros but versus the Suede and leather panels on the 2002's another one that I already mentioned is the endurance all rubber outsole on the New Balance 2002s versus the much lighter rubber outsole on the vamaros as I already mentioned again the softness on feet the marrow is much softer than the 2002 RS and also the vomeros are much lighter 11.9 ounces versus 14.7 ounces so in summary the vameros are lighter softer on Feed and definitely have a more sporty look the 2002rs are a bit heavier but have leather and suede on the uppers for the most part have much more tread on the bottom which means these are probably going to be a more durable option of the two stylistically though which one do you guys prefer leave a comment in the comment section 2002 ours or Romero's personally I'm just glad to have both of them just to show you guys the difference between both of them and honestly I really I just like both of them I think that they are similar but they're similarly different like this is not the overall same look on feet as these just because again the vomeros have just a sportier look so really you could wear these in different occasions and I think it'll be fine but anyways whoever mentioned this video to me thank you guys for suggesting it much appreciated and if you guys have other suggestions leave comments and let me know I always like to see what you guys have because I need content ideas for the future trying to to bring you guys different things here and there with whatever I can and you know I appreciate you all for uh watching the videos If you guys liked drop a like and uh subscribe if you haven't if you guys want to buy either of these again I'll link some of them in the description have a good rest of the day and hopefully see you back for some more sneaker content soon alright peace guys,2025-06-23 14:45:43.488829 UTC
JdaG_UpqQS8,New Balance 2002R,all right so this pair popped up on New Balance a site on New Year's Day and I scooped them up immediately because I wanted to see how these looked in hand and in person and on feet give you guys my thoughts on this model because it's a new one from New Balance at least new to me I know that they dropped a couple of them in 2022 but here's a look at the New Balance 1906 R and this is like the protection pack version that they dropped that they sold through or I don't know what happened to them but they had them on their website and then they removed them so I'm not really sure what happened maybe it was an accident maybe we'll see them release again and if we do I will link them over on Twitter and on Instagram and stuff uh so follow me over there if you guys don't already but these are the shoes if you want to shop the other ones available on new balan's website they do have some other 1906s I'll link them in the description and in this video I wanted to give you guys kind of a review of this model but also kind of compare it to this one which is the other version of the same midsole as you could see the midsole and the outsole is exactly the same and the 2002 RS versus is the 1906s so I wanted to give you guys kind of a side-by-side comparison uh and what is different on the 1906s versus the 2002 RS and let's go ah and get into the video now these are both the protection pack versions which they are a little bit more expensive I want to say they were 170 or so at retail I will link both of the regular versions again Linked In the description what it says about the product though it says featuring 2000's inspired running style and neutral cushioning our 2006 R men's sneaker is as fashionable as it is comfortable absorb and energy cushion provide a responsive ride and stability web outsole technology offers Superior shock absorption crafted with a stylish Nuuk leather and mesh upper for breathable durability again it has the absorb mids soil that absorbs impact through combination of cushioning and compression resistance newbu leather and mesh upper stability web outsole technology for added Arc support and energy outsole provides Superior shock absorption now the overall fit on these I would say is true to size I do wear a 9.5 and I got 9.5 on both these the 2002r and the 1906 both fit me just right so first things first the upper of this shoe definitely has a really cool feel to it especially the uh protection pack version you could see the protection pack version really just has kind of the premium hairy suede overlays but then they have the raw edges that extend past the stitching on all of the panels which is part of the reason why I think a lot of us like the protection pack of what New Balance did in the previous version so this colorway is new it's from the year of the rabbit I posted these when they went live over on New Balance if you guys saw it on Twitter or Instagram hopefully you guys caught them but this is a year of the rabbit colorway looks very very similar to the original colorway the raincloud one but it is different you notice the MSO doesn't have the blue down here like the raincloud version new boun and the color gray is just like a perfect color combination though so whether or not you have the original raincloud or the year of the rabbit versions these things are super fire protection pack version of the New Balance I think is one of the ones that sparked this revolution with New Balance where you could have like a really dope pair that's not a collaboration that instantly sells out and has a pretty nice size cult following and just a baseline model not a collaboration so I I thought that was really cool that new violance actually created some hype around a product just naturally the way that the product ended up releasing this is my first pair that I actually owned from the protection pack and I got to say I'm I'm happy that I finally got a pair of them in my Arsenal because the protection pack versions uh and kind of the raw nature look of them is just really cool with what new balance is creating and the 1906 R version of the protection pack I think looks really really cool as well now I would say overall they do look both very very similar in nature the midsoles the outs soes again exact the same where there's variance is the heel counter of the shoe has a lot of extra plastic TPU built up around this heel counter which some people aren't going to like as much as on the 2002 RS but it definitely looks pretty cool then you do have also the ends on the sides of the shoes you can see there's actually a nylon strap that goes through that comes up and is actually part of the lace structure on each side of the shoe so I thought that was kind of a nice detail that they added in as well so it goes right through two sections of the end to create the lace uh structure on both sides and then the overall look of the model does look a little bit more Sleek than the 2002r so if you're looking for something that is not as chunky I would say that this version is a little bit less chunky than the 2002r and the other thing that's really different is just the overall panel alignment on both of the shoes so both of the models have about three or four layers of different materials uh throughout the uppers of the shoes and the main difference is just the way that those panels are laid out over top of the shoe you do have a mesh underlay on both of the models it looks very very similar on both pairs and then you would have a couple panels that have some stitched over overlays on both of them I would say that the overall panels on the 1906 reminds me kind of like of a Air Max 96 the way that the panels line up on the sides the major difference between these two is the tongue the 2002r has the exposed foam on the tongue and then the 1906 is like sewn like a normal pair of running shoes so that is a little bit of a difference I believe the r and the 2002 R and the 1906 R is just for running oddly enough though on the side panel of the shoe it does say 1906 D not R so I don't know why the D is there so which one do I like better I actually prefer the 2002r a little bit over the 1906 if you like a little bit sleeker look than the 1906 I think looks really nice I do like the toe down look of the 1906 better than the 2002 RS to be honest but overall I would actually say that the 2002r version of the protection pack I do like better than uh the 1906 just overall visually for some reason I do like a little bit of a chunkier look it seems like the layers of the upper is a little bit more intricate on the 1906 though so for people that like a little bit like finer details and stuff the 1906 definitely looks a little bit finer there and then you do have the extra heal counter support on the 1906 both of them are comfortable both of them fit true to size uh if you've never tried the 2002 RS honestly it gives you like the best feel of like a retro sneaker that's like modernized on the feet like it's just really comfortable but it's not like new balance's performance running sneakers where you have the Fresh Foam X or the fuel cell which are both unbelievably good which I've covered a lot on the channel this is a different type of comfort it's a little bit more well-rounded Comfort if you will where it's like just something where everybody can just wear and not feel too squishy on feet if you want something a little bit firmer and more stable then this is definitely something that offers that if you want something that's extreme squishy then go fuel cell or go Fresh Foam X and I've done a ton of videos again on all of their other products that are amazing but all in all what do you guys think about the 1906 isn't a model that you guys are feeling or not I do like that they reuse the outsole Mido combination on the 2002 I think that it's a smart reusage of that and it really gives people an opportunity to try something that looks a little bit different on the upper side of it but they still maintain the midsole and the Integrity of the out soole and everything else that they already created which is is quite good especially since it's a new model something to consider that new balance is making like retro looking models but instead they're making new versions this is something that Nike and Jordan brand cannot do very well like you have Jordan brand performance sneakers like the 37 38s 39s that are coming and those are performance driven then you have the Retros like the Air Jordan 1es 2 3es and fours those are all in the same molds and Styles as the original products and if they do a hybrid version of an Air Jordan 23 sort of thing like people don't like the hybrid they really try those a lot and they keep failing whenever they do so I feel like New Balance really does have a competitive advantage in the space where they can create a new looking model bring new hype to a model that is not a retro it's something that is brand new to us consumers out there but made to look like a 200 or 1990s inspired and it's something that we really enjoy and it's something that is a is a very special place for New Balance to be at considering they can create something new create new hype on a new model that looks old it's a special thing to do and I think new balance is crushing it they're continuing to do an awesome job what do you guys think about the 1906s though 202s I like both of these models both of them are super nice comfortable and happy to see an extension of the 2002r in the 1906 but if you guys want to buy variations of either of these that they have available on New Balance site as well as shop any of the New Balance made in the USA collection I'll link all that stuff in the description take over to new balance's site and you guys can go check that out thank you guys for stopping by and watching the video hope you guys found it informative much appreciated and have a good rest of the day hopefully we'll see you back for some more content soon all right peace guys,2025-06-23 14:45:43.356003 UTC
c_jRJHc1NIw,Vans Old Skool,all right you guys you can stop bugging me in the comments now because yes i have been skating the new vans skate classics upgraded shoes that are slightly different than the shoes already were okay so you want to know what they're like i'll tell you all right first off let's really quickly talk about the two main different things that they did so one is an increased tread depth i don't know how much they increased it but supposedly that's going to give you more grit for longer and they're going to last a little bit longer the other thing they did is they added tongue straps which to me is actually kind of a big deal because when i used to skate old schools i found the tongue would always slip down here so that immediately solved that problem these shoes felt a little more snug on the foot and the tongue stayed right where it's supposed to all right getting right into it tread depth i mean has there been any major improvement you know these shoes are like 31 days old so we're like right on the nose for a month and they're lasting really well like there's no flat spots and this is my scoochie foot where i scooch for kickflips there's no flat spots on it it's close but it's not there yet there's actually still probably a couple weeks of life left in these easy and like good life i mean if you limp your shoes along you can get more than that out of these so in terms of durability i'm actually pretty impressed like no holes from kickflips yet either although i've been doing a little bit less kickflips than usual lately as i've had slight sore ankle so what i have been doing instead is tons and tons of heel flips now if you guys remember in my van's old school review from like three years ago i said that they were maybe the worst heelflip shoe ever i 100 rescind that comment i actually just filmed my most heel flippy video ever in these shoes and um yeah i don't know why i didn't like them for heelflips back then i think i just hadn't gotten used to them but what i find is vans actually grip so well for heelflips and you know you could see on my switch foot like i'm definitely a heel flippy dude if i'm wearing the lines away so yeah in terms of how the heel flip i actually love how these heel flip um getting into how they flick all right kick flips so one of the things that i don't like that much about vans is actually how much rubber there is here it's a positive and a negative so one of the positives is they actually last a really long time like that's surprising that i haven't blown through the side but the other thing i find about vans is like i can't get a really small little deft controlled kickflip in vans i can only get all or nothing kickflips so if i want to do big fat floaty kickflips i love them but if i'm trying to say do like a kickflip into something which i don't very often because i'm almost 40 and i find it really hard but if i'm trying to say something like manuals to kickflip out i find that i have to have so little foot on the board to make it work like it's practically like i have to be like that which makes it a little bit harder to balance so that's my only complaint about having so much rubber here is if i want that small flick it's kind of hard other than that though i don't actually have very much more to say about these i mean the durability for such like a you know insubstantial shoe is pretty good and um if you want to know like what i would say okay so how much better are they well i would say these shoes are like a 10 upgrade and so considering how heavily marketed they were that doesn't sound like very much but if you take a product that people already like they're already familiar with and you change it way too much you're gonna throw off your customer base so every once in a while throwing out ten percent improvements on products means your product consistently gets better and you don't freak out your customer base so what i have to say actually is good job vans i think these are actually a pretty decent shoe i would absolutely skate another pair even though my my dinky kickflips have suffered my lofty ones are good um yeah i would skate another pair of these the only time that i don't like wearing something like an old school is when my board chops me on the foot that's the only time but anyways you guys i'm done talking about these if you're interested get them um if you think they're gonna be like a totally different shoe and you haven't liked vans in the past that 10 percent upgrade is not going to make a difference to make you like them all of a sudden it made me like them 10 more i've worn them in the past i would wear them again that's all i have to say um i want to skate now so now you can watch footage of me skating a week ago uh uh [Applause] dude is all right yeah that was me skating a week ago i've totally done this video and the more i talk the less i'm skating right now so um i hope you guys are doing awesome uh oh yeah the answer to last week's trivia question was definitely mike carroll for sure the influence for my frontside flips i'd love to get into that more except um i spent way too much time on that heelflip video last week and i don't feel like putting a bunch of time in this week and i don't feel like doing a truck draw this week oh a selfish old ben just wants to go skateboard yeah i do i'm gonna do that hope you guys are doing awesome until the next video,2025-06-23 14:38:24.455323 UTC
4M63bRHevSA,New balance 550,american dream tv glad you guys came back new balance 550 oh drop the box new box 550 about rich paul check it out what i like about the show already is the box the presentation in this box is amazing uh they have this like raw cashew color as they call it but you know it didn't come for a box let's talk about these shoes man so i was able to get these shoes on new balance's website when they came out on december 10th of last year so a little bit older but i got them then i just want to get them out to people because it's a shoot that i think doesn't get enough praise in like the big sneaker world but it's a shoe the silhouette itself is amazing it's from the late 80s the new balance then they brought it back um and i love the new balances bringing back stuff that we haven't seen in a long time some of us have never seen ever um letting us know that they have staying power which is something that people don't necessarily respect about new balance they look at new violence like a old man sneaker but coming from washington d.c we were new balances all the time growing up 996's 1300's 2000's 2001 2002 we rocked them all the time when the 574s first came out when i was like in middle school like 98 there was two for 90. i would get a great pair and a black pair and i was set new violence 550 has that raw cashew color around the entire shoe itself the midsole has that raw cashew kind of more of an off-white um if you want to be exact with it kind of has a tan tone to it the leathers on this is absolutely incredible you wouldn't expect anything different from new balance though because quality is what they bring all the time um that's what they've been known for is just quality sneakers quality footwear for 30 plus years now uh they got the 550 and brought it on the front of shoe as well too in the upper side here the tongue has that rich paw about 550 order with that caterpillar going down i mean i just love everything about this sneaker i do love the sky blue they put into this as well too with some of the navy hints as well navy blue itself is my favorite color to wear favorite color in general is orange but i love wearing navy blue itself it's very soft leather but it's also very sustainable leather as well too so what i had bought my 550s over the summer the last was the first flaxseed bar the first ones actually purchased were the 550 this is the multi-color i bought these last summer and i wore these all the time and with that leather on the top on the toe as well you can also see how the actual leather itself doesn't necessarily crease up very much and if you saw me last summer i was more likely in this sneaker i water shoot everywhere like i worked my son's baseball games i was around to dinner my wife i mean this shoe serves all my purposes so that just goes into the quality of the sneaker and how new balance always found in a way to just make things last like they just do like you don't hear about new balances falling apart like some sneaker brands um and this is what they do man they just make classic silhouettes that you can just change the colors on them and turn heads and this is what i love new balance is why i love this 550 sneaker itself now the shoe also did come with navy laces and some white laces the raw casual laces came in stock i don't necessarily like the white laces idea on them because there's no white at all on the actual sneaker however i wish new vlogs would have been like a nice sky blue lace that had been super awesome to go with this shoe you can go buy your own sky blue laces but the sky blitz would have fit way better than a white lace will fit in this actual sneaker that's just my style as well too so i'm a fan i hope you guys like it as well too okay sizing on this new balance 550 i have a wide foot so i always go up half size new balances as it is but i go up half size a lot of my shoes anyway because they're made a little more narrow so i go up half size and then fit me to a tee very comfortable only thing i will say is if you have more of a narrow foot i would try to say true to size maybe go down like a half size in this actual sneaker if you were looking to purchase it mainly because the actual back of the actual shoe itself it does have cushioning which is pretty awesome but there can be like some hill slippage mainly because in heel slip which means when you walk your back of your foot kind of flips out you know that happens sometimes mainly because this shoe is very low profile really low uh very low profile it's very thin uh midsole as well too so when you walk you don't have that extra bit of height to hold the back of your hold your heel in so i would definitely say if you are a narrow foot i would try to stay true to your size or without a half a size um this shoe was 130 when i got off new balance's website on december 10th it's pretty easy process i'm not gonna lie to you new balance does a phenomenal job with their releases much better than some other brands i mean actually [ __ ] pretty fast they got here like like the 12 or 13 or so so they got them to me extremely quick as well too so shout out to the balance for that but i love this shoe man i've worn it so much already um and it's a shoe that i highly recommend for anybody looking for a sneaker that is a daily wear that still has style to it as well too because so many times you rather get like a comfortable shoe that doesn't have any style you got a stylus shoe that has no comfort new balancing itself just fits the mold in every aspect and for an individual looking for a shoe that's going to make them have that comfortability give them that style you can't go wrong with new balance in general let alone this 550. if you like them buy them rock them enjoy them if you want to sit on them that's fine just do you anyway love you guys see you guys next time all right come back i'm not playing for real come back seriously you you you come back i'll highlight,2025-06-23 14:50:44.937123 UTC

sneaker review it's been a while since I've done these and I finally have been able to figure out my setup um so yeah it's been a while since I've done like a sit down video and just really being in my in front of my camera and just really be in the zone but today I wanted to show you guys some new sneakers that I Got U actually got these sneakers a while ago but I haven't worn them out because I really wanted to show you to you guys first and style it and you know basically make all this content with it to let you guys know like hey what yeah so anyways um I got the Nike Cortez vintage the Vintage let's SLE it let's SLE it let's settle it the Vintage Nike Cortez woman's sneaker and the chlorophyll sale and light blue um colorway so this is it I got it in a size seven that's usually my size so I do stay true to size majority with all my Nike sneakers I do own another pair of Nike Cortez um they're up here somewhere in the back they're in like a red white and blue color way very very cute and I'm actually a big fan of the Cortez I like how classic they are comfortable and although I do have like small feet I guess a lot of people think I have small feet whenever they look down they're just like oh what size are you I'm just like I'm a seven um I love how they shape my feet so it's such a nice classic sneaker I feel like it's great to have in your closet and it comes in a wide range of colorways um that you guys can get I got my pair from nordstroms.com so it was $100 which is pretty cheap I would say especially nowadays with sneakers and everything um so yeah I was really excited to see see this pair of sneaker um on Nom's site because honestly it's so unique that I really thought it was going to sell out so I like bought it right away cuz I'm like yo these are dope and I really like having sneak that are so like different and dope and just make my outfit like amplifies my outfit even more especially when it comes to like the textures of it and the colors and the shape and everything so I'm really glad that I got my hands on these um I don't know how or when they first dropped I just saw them on those DRS and then I was like oh these are cute um and then it cropped uh so yeah this is the sneaker right here as you guys seen in the little Montage that I have in the beginning um this is the sneaker so cute I love the texture so much the details of the sneaker is just like Exquisite guys it's so good it's so amazing and I really really do love the colorway um as you can see it has like the white check and then on the bottom it's more of like a cream or like an ivory instead of a pure white and then on the top um as you can see on the top it has the retro Nike logo um with the little orange swoosh and then orange inside and then that nice blue light blue on this side as well and as well as in the back too um so I think this is really cute but I think the colorway complements each other each colors very very nicely it's not like wo that's ugly or what the heck well in my opinion um I really do like this I love how it's like calm like you could wear probably like an all cream white neutral outfit and then have these on it's just like wow and then along with the um fabric of the shoe it just basically adds on to your accessories cuz it's already adding texture and flavor and juiciness to your outfit because you're using something else difference now you're not using leather you're not using whatever the typical patent whatever I forgot the material name but you know this is different like I haven't seen anything like this um so I'm really really excited to have this in my closet these cost $100 so not crazy expensive and I would say they're pretty true to size like if you've own Cortez or not um definitely get stay true to size stay true to siid and they will fit nicely um so I'm not going to make this video too lengthy let's go ahead and jump right into how I style these sneakers I take it even need to be

yzvchSDWjns,Nike Dunk Panda,are Nike Dunks still good basketball shoes well let's find out this is the Nike Dunk low Panda but if you didn't know Nike Dunks actually started as basketball shoes for college players back in 1982. the traction might seem very familiar because it did Inspire the Air Jordan 1 traction which is amazing no differ here the traction is by far the best part about the shoe because when you head over to the cushioning it is the worst cushioning I've ever used in a shoe there is literally nothing but rubber every time you dunk or every time you land you feel a shot going through your body so stick to wearing these casually but that's why I was wondering,2025-06-23 14:49:38.146191 UTC
APpnxnMl_QM,on cloudmonster 2,are the oncloud monster 2 worth the running shoe Glory welcome back to today with t Rock I'm Taylor Rockwell and today we're diving into a review of the oncloud monster 2 running shoes if you're looking for the perfect pair of shoes for your run stay tuned because I'll be breaking down everything you need to know about these shoes and we'll also be touching on the oncloud Legacy does it really feel like you're running on clouds first things first let's start with the key features of the on cloud Cloud monster 2 these shoes are designed with Innovative cloudtech technology providing excellent cushioning and support they're made from a lightweight breathable mesh that keeps your feet cool and comfortable they weigh 245 G they're made from a nylon blend and a speedboard technology for momentum and Powerful takeoffs according to their website they have the best ever cloudtech technology equaling in an extra cushioning running shoe as well as the mesh on the upper half of the shoe made from 100% recycled polyester and they have a foam insert to absorb impact first let's talk form and fit when it comes to form and fit the oncloud monster 2 feels like a dream they fit true to size offering a snug yet comfortable fit I didn't experience any discomfort during the break-in period which is a big plus however I must mention I usually am not wanting to get blisters from new shoes so the break-in process is usually seamless for most shoes I'm getting used to now let's dive into what everybody wants to know the performance I took these shoes out for various runs including short Sprints and long distances they performed exceptionally well on all terrains the cushioning provided a smooth ride and I felt supported throughout my entire run not to mention I felt like these shoes were so light compared to my other running shoes but I'll dive into that a little B bit later throughout this video now let's talk durability durability is another strong point for the oncloud monster 2os the high quality material and the solid construction make them a reliable choice for long-term use after clocking in over miles they still look and feel amazing now let's compare compared to other popular running shoes like the Nike Pegasus or the Adidas's Ultra boost the oncloud monster 2 stands out with its unique cushioning technology and Superior Comfort When comparing them to my Hoka Bondi eights the biggest difference for me is the weight when I am running in my hogas my feet feel ginormous and clunky I usually reach for my hogas because I am nurturing a knee injury right now and I prefer the thick cushioning on the bottom of my shoes however the oncloud monster twos offer the same thick bottom that makes me feel supported and they are absorbing most of the impact because they feel so light and flowy I feel like I am flying in these shoes it's also worth mentioning that I noticed that these shoes did not have as much grip compared to other running shoes I'm used to running in I usually am running close to Seaside therefore surfaces I am running on can be slippery because there's a light layer of sand on the sidewalk so having that extra grip can be comforting the final noticeable difference is that I could feel the road underneath me now some people love and prefer to be able to fill the ground underneath them when they're running and others hate it I personally did not mind it and it was actually a nice change for my hokas where I usually cannot feel the ground at all underneath me during any of my runs before we get to ahead of ourselves let's discuss the pros and cons the pros include excellent cushioning lightweight design and great dirt ability not to mention the way these babies look are hot I feel so fresh and icy stepping out in these I seriously love the way they look especially on my feet on the downside they might be a bit pricey for some and the design might not appeal to everyone as well as your preferences on grip and being able to fill the ground underneath you this may or may not be a downside of yours in conclusion the oncloud monster 2 is a fantastic choice for runners looking for a comfortable and durable shoe whether you're a beginner or an experienced Runner these shoes have a lot to offer if you've tried these SHO CH before please let me know in the comments down below don't forget to like comment subscribe and turn on the Bell notifications for more running gear reviews let me know what you want me to review next and I'll see you in the next video oh and yes they do feel like you're running on clouds,2025-06-23 14:41:04.077498 UTC
96RT1vyK7KE,Adidas Gazelle,"are these the best Samba dupes let's find out the Adidas gazelle the doubleganger to the samba I see dupe though not because of the price as the base model of the gazel is actually typically $10 more expensive than the SAS but SAS are way more likely to be sold out and tough to get the trendy color you actually want so I found gazelle is a great alternative when you want that pretty red Samba that you absolutely cannot find first time on and the sizing is off they feel very hard but they're comier than I thought I don't know these fit a little larger than trud to size and their size is a bit bigger than the SAS L breathable slightly heavier than the samba and more stiff yet comfier I can't really explain it starting to walk and they felt great I enjoyed them way faster than the SAS first week and a few walks and honestly I was shocked how much I was enjoying them but then I went for a longer walk and despite these being sneakers I would not want to spend all day in them they just don't have the support needed for miles and miles I definitely like these more than the SAS but not they're not that much different you can definitely feel the ground under your foot like if you stepped on Pebble they do have this rubber so that I did enjoy more than the Somas after several weeks my thoughts same as the Somas after about 10,000 steps a day and them my shins and feet are soared due to the lack of support but some people do love a flat foot no support shoe but that's just not me I'm not that girl the con's tongue is super annoying in these it kind of moved around and got in the way the pros these are super cute and a wide variety of colors like I was in Sweden I got Sweden colored ones the options are endless final thoughts these are what I call a shopping shoe they're great for lots of walking and being on your feet but you're taking breaks and standing still versus a Haw girl walking shoe that you can last a full hour in without taking any breaks cute firsts practical skill uh I forgot in Canada so enjoy my temporary virtual diagram results very cute slightly above mid comfort",2025-06-23 14:39:00.647228 UTC
yLDlZFXrnxA,New balance 550,are you looking for a new Timeless classic white summer clean sneaker then look no further today's review we have the new balance 550. hey guys and welcome back to my YouTube channel I hope you guys are all doing well today's video we have the New Balance 550 and let me tell you this is literally becoming the sneaker of the Year forget the dunks forget the Air Forces forget anything else it's all about the New Balance 550s actually came out in 1989 and came out as a basketball shoe which is quite common these days it was recently brought back and kind of hyped up by the collaboration with aod they brought out four colorways and I can't lie they're all really really nice colorways then boom they brought out so many more colorways as general releases and you can now pretty much find any colorway that you want in the 550s which is obviously amazing kind of caters to everyone's needs so I've done enough talking for now so let's bring out the new balance 550s and I got this in the colorway white and gray starting with boxing they come in the general release New Balance box and nothing really too special they come in this kind of gray box and then as you can see we have a light gray logo on the top which has the New Balance logo and then pretty much it's pretty plain we've got another little logo here and then of course we have the kind of sizing and coding and all of that as you can see it says bb550 which stands for basketball so here we have the New Balance 550 and the colorway white and gray even though it is a white and gray colorway obviously the sole is only gray it's basically a white shoe obviously giving us that clean summer Vibe the actual silhouette of the shoe is actually quite basic I feel like there's nothing that crazy about it but again at the same time that's what makes it such a classic Timeless silhouette taking a look at the finer details of the shoe we do have a leather upper I must admit this is where New Balance kind of really excellent I think is that the quality of the leather is very very good compared to some other brands we have quite a lot of overlays going on as you can see towards the mid panel is where we have the perforated leather panel here then going on to the kind of branding of the shoe we have the 550 as you can see near the eyelids towards the front of the shoe and then of course we have the famous New Balance logo on the mids panel as well this time it's kind of in a padded leather material moving towards the back of the shoe is where we do have some padded mesh as well especially towards the ankle where the Hill tab is this really helps with comfortability and then just underneath we have the New Balance logo I absolutely love this new balance logo and this is in the gray I have a padded tongue tag and as you can see we have the logo tongue tuck stitched on and we have some basketballs on there as well obviously because it is a basketball shoe we do take a look inside the shoe we also have the mesh padding carrying on inside the shoe moving on to the insole we have a black insole with a new balance logo as well taking a look at the midsole we have a white midsole and we've got two new balance logos so we've got the NB and then we've actually got the words New Balance as well which I really like again this is in white so I feel like it kind of just merges in if we do take a look around the other side we do have this kind of foam piece in the middle as well this again is to help with comfortability and then if we take a look towards the sole we have a gray sole now this sole is amazing for two reasons first of all it's a non-marking sole and also the grip shed is absolutely amazing now this is where the shoe gets interesting because we do have ortholite comfort foam insoles author light is actually also used by Adidas we see a lot of Adidas trainers have these as well and they're also eco-friendly so with this insole you're getting long-term cushioning high level breathability and lightweight comfort as well which just makes the shoe it just brings the shoe all together these are the silhouette and the comfortability of the shoe this makes it an amazing everyday shoe it's just so versatile you can literally wear it for anything and also with anything as well obviously depending on what colorway you get pricing wise these come in 120 pounds which is about 140 150 dollars now even though these are a general release and other colorways they seem kind of pretty hard to get but I do think that is because people are going crazy for them they sell out so so quickly which is a little bit irritating if you are trying to get your hands on them you can pay resale of course resell is only probably about 20 pounds more than retail but I feel like for me personally I would just wait for retail to drop there are so many drops of this shoe you just have to be a little bit patient and you will get your hands on a pair for retail sizing wise I'm normally a UK 7 which is my normal true to size size however I did find these small so I had to go up a 0.5 5 size therefore if you are looking at getting these I would recommend going up a 0.5 size overall I feel like this is such a good white clean summer pair to have I feel like it's giving a little bit of a different vibe compared to kind of your usual Air Force Ones dunks that we have seen this is literally something that you can literally wear with absolutely anything one thing for me that I will say though obviously these are soft leather they are going to crease especially in the white colorway as well it's inevitable you cannot get away from that obviously as well Air Force ones are really really bad at creasing they probably crease even worse they crease literally after wearing them for two days however what I will say is personally for me I feel like Air Force Ones get so creased so badly and I really really don't like the look of them when they do get creased especially when they get dirty as well whereas obviously for these These are obviously going to get cruise but I feel like these kind of look more better with creases whereas I feel like the Air Force Ones I'm not feeling them with creases whereas these they kind of rock with a whole vibe of the shoe that brings me to the end of the video thank you guys so much for watching today's video let me know in the comments below whether you have a pair of New Balance five 50s I am suspecting a lot a lot a lot of people have them or are getting them by now and let me know what

4Qqt5LLvX2E,Vans Old Skool,be everyone Josue with tactics today we're going to be going over the Vans skate old school when I put these on I instantly got that kick of nostalgia from all the other old schools that I skated always had a super fun time Skating them had the best board feel I skated a lot of the old school Pros in the past and these are a little bit different they have a higher foxing tape they got the six stick Rubber outsole and they also have the pop cush insole initially these shoes were a little bit harder for me to break in they were a little bit stiff they were a little bit harder for me to flick with because the boxing tape is a little bit higher compared to the old school Pros it felt like the flick was a little bit too grippy so I had to kind of readjust how to do my kickflips and heel flips but after about half an hour I was able to do most of my flip tricks pretty easily these shoes ran really true to size they fit very comfortably and snugly I'm a nine and these nines fit great for me they're a little bit wider around the upper part of the toe box which really helped out my foot since I have a wider foot it has these red internal tongue straps that keep the tongue completely in place and it lays right above my foot making it extra comfortable as far as impact protection the pop cush insole was not so bad I wasn't jumping down big stairs or anything but it did provide enough to not feel super sore at the end of my sessions so I've skated these shoes for about a month now and after adding up all the times that I've skated them I'd say about 30 to 40 hours as we can see here there's a lot of wear on the kickflip area there's a blown out hole right here on the ollie spot and the dura cap underneath saved me from you know ripping up my sock underneath so that was pretty cool the van stripe kind of fell apart there and the grip has maintained its grippiness over the entire time so that was really cool so on the switch shoe you can see here that I have a blown out hole from doing switch heals you can see that the dura cap does not go past this seam right here so my sock was pretty much exposed right there but luckily I didn't get any holes in my socks as you can see there's no rip laces on either shoe and the toe box did not stretch at all over the time I was skating it so it's maintained its Comfort level the entire time one issue that I did run into with these shoes was that on the right shoe in particular this side of the toe box would pinch my toe knuckle and I realized that the stock insole was a little bit thicker so what I did was I replaced it with the ultra Kush insole from another pair of vans that I had and it solved a problem I was able to skate comfortably and I had no more toking right there so I like to skate a lot of Street I like to do a lot of flip tricks and skate Ledges and stuff but honestly any skateboarder can skate this whether they like skating Street or a skating transition overall these skated really well the old schools are some of my favorite pairs of Vans to skate I've been skating them since high school and I'm sure I'll be skating them again if you're soaking on these shoes check them out at tactics what do you think me should I skate him again,2025-06-23 14:38:20.108448 UTC
V8RNKFTaW5c,Onitsuka Mexico 66,cool girls and guys are wearing these and they're like the new it sneaker I think they took the place of the samba hey hey I'm back with another shoe review I haven't done one since the sambas that I did like maybe 2 or 3 years ago um and I wanted to wait to do these until I've worn them and I get a good feel for them I got these almost 2 years ago these are the Mexico 66 onit onitsuka tiger uh shoes uh Kill Bills some people call them affiliated with A6 that's why you see this little stripe on the side a lot of people have questions about that and I can give you like a little history on them so basically onitsuka it's like the sport and good brand was started in 1949 um and it's a Japanese craftsmanship they're known for like their Timeless aesthetic as you can see you know bringing track to the streets these are very like slim silhouette um but yeah then they merged with two other companies like GTO and Jank I'm pretty sure is the name of it um in 1977 and from there it became A6 Corporation um in 1966 they came out with the Mexico line hence the name the Mexico 66 that's when they came out with the whole stripe situation and then now A6 uses the stripes on ituka uses a stripe 2002 they were re-released and rebr branded onitsuka and so now they're out and about a few years ago a few celebrities and models um started wearing them again and they became popular again I got these like about 2 years ago and I literally swear by them some people don't like how slim they are or that they're kind of like sort of low to the ground I love it I feel personally I have like half of an arched foot like I feel like it's like kind of arched but like the side is kind of flat I feel like these are perfect I've walked miles and miles and miles I'm not suggesting you do that but I've walked miles and miles in these shoes and they have sort of a I still have like the I like to keep my sneakers with the little um don't mind the discoloration but I've worn these out but in the insole so like the inner part of your what is that the bridge of your foot um they have like a little a little bump cushion in case in case you do have arched feet which is really nice um it makes it feel like you're walking on a cloud I mean they're meant to feel like you're Barefoot um I believe the runner that they made this for originally ran Barefoot so they made a shoe that felt like you were running Barefoot um I've never run in these I wouldn't recommend running in these um I love these for walking though and for like errands throwing them on they're a great pop of color I love the style of them but then also for Comfort they're so comfortable um it's a super soft leather all around so I feel like it's not like my I have pretty wide feet I feel like it doesn't like trap my foot in it's super breathable because of that so these sneakers came in this box on ituka tiger um and I actually bought them on I'm seeing now I bought them on stockx it's been really hard for me to find like cool sneakers at like your local sneaker shop so I usually get my sneakers like my good cool sneakers on Goat or stockx they were $191 but today I got these back in 2022 yeah today they're like they went down in price they're like maybe like $120 which is more reasonable I think I even seen them for $100 the smaller your foot size your shoe size the higher the prices tend to be for sneakers like cool trending sneakers and honestly like the larger your foot size the more availability and um the like less you have to pay for your sneakers on these websites specifically but um yeah I was in London recently and I missed the store so they actually have a few Stores um sorry I feel like I should be like holding the shoe while I'm speaking they actually have a few stores in London or maybe one I don't know if I just made that up a few stores I know they have a few as6 stores I think they have like a flagship in London now which is really cool I wanted to make it and then I forgot to go I went to another sneaker shop and they didn't have onitsuka but they had lots of like Somas and Jazelle like they were like Adidas heavy in there um but that's kind of why I like these because they're um another option instead of wearing the SAS cuz I think I'm like kind of tired of the SAS all although I do plan on getting the black but just because I want like a pair of black sneakers that aren't these cuz I'm already going to get these in silver all that to say is I highly recommend these These are amazing comfortable Chic the color is amazing they have all different sorts of colors if this is like not up your alley like this color is too loud for you they've got neutrals they've got black they got silver they I think they even have Reds all sorts of colors so I would definitely give them give them a try on I think on their website they are like sold out of smaller sizes like I mentioned but they do have larger sizes and then the smaller sizes you can definitely find on like goat or stock stockx something else that I really like about this is that they look really good super super clean pristine brand new and they also look really good worn like I've worn them for close to 2 years now and I feel like they almost look a little better than when they were clean and like brand new so that's my hot take I know it kind of sucks that they don't have like that you can't really find these in person especially in the US um if you're in London you're fine um not sure where else they might have a store or where you could try these on in person especially I'm not sure how stockx and goat what their like return policy are policies are or if they even allow you to return I find that they are true to size I got um a five and half men's which translates to 6 and 1/2 women's and I have wide feet like I said um but because I'm pretty sure because it's such a soft leather the shoe they fit like a glove like I didn't feel I didn't feel like I tried them on I don't feel the need to size up in them um and they're breathable like I said they're not suffocating my feet or crunching up my toes um I think I would go true to size if I were you not sure if you can tell but my feet are I feel like they're pretty wide they're they've got some like fat on the sides but this is what I mean like these shoes are so slim and the leather is so soft that you can just slide right in and I don't even need to fix them with my hand like I don't need to like stick my finger back there pull up the tongue a little bit but you can see I'm wiggling my toe the whole shoe is moving which is definitely giving you a little show of how soft this leather is let me slip my other foot in here oh got caught yeah these are literally my favorite shoes they're so soft so comfortable and I'm actually about to run out so they're good for slip and go okay actually finishing this video off in the car because I actually had to go somewhere and I was wearing my my onitsuka Mexico 66 I just took it off see how fast how easily I was able to take it off I highly recommend so I hope this video was useful I hope it was helpful and I hope it makes you helps you make your decision um I give it a thumbs up let me know what you think or if you have them and if you don't like them and why you don't like them but I love them so they get the they get the green check from me okay bye guys thank you so much for watching,2025-06-23 14:44:49.596844 UTC
Aq9xNHYmZtM,Reebok Club C 85 Vintage shoes,everything you need to know about the rebot club C 85 vintage before you buy it it's a slim shoe and has a narrow toe box for a snug fit go through the size for a loose fit go a half size up they kind of look like orthopedic shoes but at the same time they look really great they're very comfortable I put them at about an 8 out of 10 I don't know what they're doing over at Reebok but the leather that they're made out of is really soft in case you're wondering they don't add any height they retail for $90 which is crazy because 2 years ago they retailed for 75 and this colorway is technically called chalk paper white,2025-06-19 08:38:11.245600 UTC
o3gcz7Q5JbQ,New Balance 990,feels so nice in the garage when it's not in like 100 degrees it's freezing no I feel awesome it's so good yo what's good guys my name is Chris welcome back to the officialweartesters.com YouTube channel today we got a detailed look and review on these old things right here I mean they do look like rainbow shoes right but this is the new balance 990 V6 which is kind of cool that sounds a lot cooler than they look but anyways uh this is the box I think it's actually kind of cool I've never seen a new balance box with a top load like this they normally have the just you know the hinge box what not those made in America USA ones we had maybe that's what this is then because uh this is made in USA also at least up to 70 percent of it they do come with extra laces too by the way and look it you can be sustainable well if you really want to be sustainable you just take off all the junk and just do that no paper no plastic we're good he's been trying to shoehorn that in for like three videos he keeps cutting it out keeps cutting it out I'm just gonna keep doing them broken record but anyways again this is the New Balance 990 V6 the 990 model or series is one of their most popular it's not my favorite did you guys want a video on my favorite New Balances it's actually a newer kind of model or newer style even though it's not but it kind of is they're awesome but anyways these just released so I did grab a pair they're widely available over at newbalance.com in like wide sizes too there was narrow they were standard there was extra width options so if you were interested in one of these in any of those Styles or builds fit whatever how they're built on the last for your specific foot shape then go over to New Balance they actually care about all that stuff you know what I mean like they're like an actual or they were a foot shoe company the original shoe companies are really really interesting they're very fascinating to me them Puma Converse A6 Adidas like all of those brands are like fascinating Saucony so yeah but this is a lifestyle shoe with performance in mind which is interesting because normally they do the opposite they make performance shoes and they try to make it with lifestyle in mind so they can kind of cross categorize them and go wear them with your pants or whatever it is or off Court Encore all that this is not like that it's a little bit different the original models were Runners and now they just make them for lifestyle which is cool this believe it or not though is the most comfortable like everybody always told me like Ryan what's up you're awesome he's one of our wear testers Discord community members he's one of the reasons why this channel exists because he helps fund it so we can actually pay for all this he was pushing New Balance hard he's a hardcore New Balance fan which I appreciate if you're a fan of anything stick by and push that as much as you can so he converted me into buying that's how come we have New Balance reviews or the ones that are like this on this channel and everything like that the basketball ones I already like so I I grabbed a couple of them and everybody always says New Balance super comfortable super comfortable super comfortable not for me I don't know why but they like give me blisters just walking in them you know what I mean so like it's really weird we were going on our like four plus mile box and I was wearing the 990 whatevers there I don't remember which model it was b2s or something like that I would wear those on our walks because you know they're walking shoes for old people they were literally tearing my toes apart nobody makes blood why is this happening and so yeah it was just a big bummer they weren't as comfortable as I'd hoped this one though as soon as I put them on they were bouncy I was like what the is this it was awesome so yeah if you're interested in comfort from New Balance this one right here actually has it the outsole is really cool too it feels grippy-ish man and I love I love the like that's awesome that's friction that's not just friction that's a really good rubber okay that's really good rubber it's actually not friction I'm just sliding on it it's not moving yeah that's your hand getting ready that's friction you got a really cool call back at the toe it says established in 1982 which I believe is a nod to the 990 model the midsole though is uh interesting because for one it's very Dynamic looking looks a lot different than some of their other 99 models even though they do still have the same kind of lines and things like that so it's like you know visually like oh I can see that you know what I mean but it's not a direct copy and paste on top of that they still have their end cap system which is highlighted in this gray normally their end cap system is polyurethane so I don't know if this is 100 polyurethane but it feels very dense compared to the rest of the midsole which is actually fuel cell and this is the type of fuel cell that I wish was a massable stuff not exactly like this because this is a little too soft and stuff but if they had it be close to this or closer to it I think that their basketball stuff would be well it's hard to say like more well received because people just don't with stuff that's outside of Nike right now like it's just really weird but I do think that if there were people that went to go try them on that's where you would get like oh those are hella comfortable cool like instead of like some of the Nikes and stuff where unless they have zoom air in them especially right now where it's like top loaded Zoom Air it's got to be like really done well those are the shoes that typically will wow you not like they're basic Nikes that you see at like Famous Footwear or whatever like a low-level Nike model but anyways these are super comfortable so I really dig that this is the insole by the way I don't know what the hell this is made out of does not look like ortholite but it's an open-celled foam it'll probably compact very very quickly move insoles yes but you can always swap out the insole you don't have to get moved but if you wanted a good insole you might they are making casual insoles very soon we will have our review up soon as well so stay tuned for that now as far as the materials are concerned dude it's a New Balance man it's a New Balance 990 on top of that so all of the materials here are pretty basic as far as the textiles are concerned and the overlays but the top overlays where all the suede is is buttery man I love the way that it looks I love the way that it feels it's comfortable it's Airy doesn't take any break in time like all of this is like a mesh build you know what I mean so like all that flexibility is already there the only thing I don't know what it is it's like the shape or something man they just look like Grandpa shoes man it's a color no the color is awesome I love the gray ones I love a gray shoe too but this is um it's a grandpa gray but then you call like like anything that's white and blue Grandpa that's like I'm a dad and I'm gonna become a grandpa so those are those are Dad's shoes that's a grandpa and train [Laughter] okay so there's Dad shoes and then there's Grandpa shoes all right there are some reflective hits per usual so you can see that on the toe at the base of the lace the full on and emblem or logo and branding uh all of this stuff I mean this is this is actually a lot of reflective I'm kind of surprised normally you get like one in the front one in the back I dig it I can't say that anymore I already used up my I dig it I'm trying to diversify interesting nope can't use that either is that in the last video These are fantastic that's another good one you're fired I'm just kidding and then just like the rear says it is made in America that is where I think that they should kind of like switch up their lingos a little bit say that they were assembled in America like The Avengers she took my line I said that before okay but there was a dog on the other side of the wall doing something loud now as far as their fit is concerned they're a little roomy they're roomy above the toe it could just be the shape and everything like that and all this like really light material so if you like that kind of feeling then you'll be fine with it I personally like a little bit more of a snug thing but at the same time like that is better for your foot it allows it to breathe allows it to move it allows the toes to splay a little bit so if you have a wide foot they have all these options that again they even have narrow so that's cool you know what I mean so new balance is one of the brands that actually cares about those types of things so if you care about that or you need that type of thing go try out New Balance if you haven't already you might like some of their stuff if you like looking like Grandpa but with all that being said thank you guys so much for watching thanks for all the support I do think that the model was cool I think the model is comfortable it's just not something for me personally but if it is for you I hope that you enjoyed everything uh we were just joking around so I don't take anything personally I think people that buy these know that these are kind of grandpaish right I would hope so me too but like I said sound off below and let us know what you think about these Down Below in the comment section they are very expensive so be prepared for that if you have not bought a pair of New Balances already that's probably going to be the biggest shocker besides like the material quality is the price and it is because they are assembled in America but thank you again for watching we really appreciate it we'll catch you on the next one so until then have a good one you know what man I might wear these to the movies and get some Twizzlers no no I know Twizzlers are gross it's all about Red Vines I'm gonna wear my barks ew my birthday ones oh okay I guess that's fine use them or lose them with this hat oh you're gonna be so cute,2025-06-23 14:42:41.741033 UTC

yMZZkGF92_k,on cloudmonster 2,flow like water so I'm going main stream what's up guys welcome back to my Channel today we have an exciting one for you we have the on or on cloud however you want to call it the cloud monster 2.0's I've been really excited to show you guys these shoes I'm not sure if you call them Cloud monster 2 or 2.0 it says two here but on the site it says 2.0 uh we'll go with 2.0 for today anyway so let's get some initial reaction open up the box here here we are so they look really really nice out of the box that's the real reason I got them I've been hearing a lot of hype about the oncloud brand especially these Cloud monsters and I wanted to test them out for myself and show you guys what I think here we go right off the bat these are some excellent looking shoes I got this black and white color because I don't like to get wacky colors like red or blue but to each their own I like to be able to match with everything and I'm not sure I can really do that with a red or a blue color on brand says that this is the most cushion of any on shoe that they've made and I believe them we could see the heel cushion over here is well over one in large they're trying to directly compete with Brands like Hoka and New Balance with the max cushion look here because a lot of consumers want the maximum cushion so they could save their pressure on their other joints while still having a pretty versatile and sporty shoe so this shoe at least before trying it on seems to have gotten that done I know oncloud is going for a more sustainable Mission they've mentioned with this shoe that the upper part of it is 100% recycled materials and I know other parts of the shoe are made of recycled materials as well they don't seem to have sacrificed on the quality the quality of the outside feels pretty good feels like a very breathable shoe so one reason I might take this over a shoe like the Hoka is because we have that same level of cushion but we still have a very breathable upper on the shoe and that's very important if you're going to wear these all day you want that combination of cushion and still breathability one last thing I wanted to mention with these shoes is that I really didn't like the look of the oncloud brand with the way that they have holes in the bottom I never thought that that looked great but this is the first model especially in this color that I really enjoy the look I'm not sure why but suddenly those holes in the shoe that used to look a little silly to me are starting to look very cool and very stylish so enough talking let's try these on and tell you what I think he all right well that was really really fun these are some excellent shoes and the on brand is definitely doing something right with these I could immediately feel the heel cushion and all of the responsiveness that it provided it felt like I was walking on Springs honestly you could see in those videos as I was running and as I was jumping you could see the the heel holes here sort of acting like a shock absorber and bending and compressing as I was stepping down and when I was jumping you could see even at the toe there was that same shock absorption they felt really really lightweight to walk in like I said they have this really lightweight upper and that was surprising I felt like I was just wearing my sock yet they have this this really really nice cushion that usually comes in a heavier shoe so they really nailed the combo with that one these are probably one of the best shoes you could wear for a long day at work I can't necessarily speak on the durability or the longevity of these shoes and I would appreciate if any of you can comment down below if you've worn this brand the oncloud brand or if you know these shoes if you could comment down below how long they've lasted you and if they're durable over time they seem like they would be durable over the long run so they have that 10 out of 10 feel with the lightweight and thex maximum cushion that I honestly have not felt on another shoe brand yet but are they worth $180 that they are for the price tag I would say if you're like me and you like the cushion and the lightweight of these shoes definitely worth the $180 I know that's a lot it's something that was preventing me from trying this brand and this shoe type from the beginning when other brands like Hoka are coming in around 140 or less but they were worth the try and worth the money and I think you guys will like them too let me know if you think they're worth it in the comments one last thing I wanted to mention with these shoes is the biomechanical aspect they have a very high supportive Arch which is very good for your feet and at no point in wearing these did I feel like they were unstable even though they have that really lightweight upper I never felt like my foot was moving around or that they weren't secure in these shoes so they have a really good combination of stability and cushion which you don't usually find in a lot of shoes so for me these are the shoes of the year but I have yet to try the new Hoka Clifton 9es that will be my next video I'll be comparing these shoes and the hokas to see which one takes the win for the year so make sure you tune in to that video I have not opened them yet but I'm excited to compare these two thank you guys for tuning in for watching this video I appreciate all of you I appreciate all of your feedback comments and ideas please send any suggestions you have in the comments below and I will be sure to read it and respond to you thank you guys again for joining me so make sure you guys like comment and subscribe I'll be reading all of your comments I'm always ready to try a new shoe or a new shoe brand as you saw today I tried the oncloud brand for the first time and that's because of your suggestions so please continue with the suggestions and I'll be following them and incorporating them and thank you for following along with me guys this is one big family I appreciate all of you again it doesn't have to be shoes if you guys want my opinion on any Healthcare product or really anything for that matter please write it in the comments and I'll be sure to make a video have a great day going M straight he,2025-06-23 14:41:02.831055 UTC
ecTFwGItbJE,Stan Smith,for episode two of the white sneaker series were cut in half the shoes that might have started the whole white sneaker trend Stan Smith's before we get to the sneakers I want to tell you about the father's day sell I'm doing on the wallets and the re-release of the Clayton wall it's been on hiatus and I've slowly been redesigning it over the last couple years and this is one of the wallets I'm more proud of because where most people would do a stitch line I figured out how to fold it so this seven pocket wallet only has four stitch slides throughout the whole wallet and for Father's Day you can get 10% off any of the wallets including this one and a free set of matching coasters until the Father's Day with the code leather dad now to the information on these sneakers so the brand is adidas the style is a Stan Smith's the colorway is the triple cloud light they retail for $80 on their site and they're made in India and the backstory in the shoes is pretty interesting and if you want to see a full video on this nacho average finds does a really good video but all started about sixty years ago in the early 60s when this shoe was released and became the first widely successful leather shoes made for tennis tennis shoes and it was originally under a different tennis players name his name was Robert Hale it but after he retired they needed a new spokesman for the shoe that's where they found Stan Smith and Stan Smith took the shoe to the height of its professional success but as the shoe sneaker technology kind of evolved these transition to more of the street where we're going to have everyday tennis shoe and they've kind of just been popular ever since and you kind of see a lot of the design elements and lines of these shoes reflected in the more modern she was like the common projects so kind of an interesting story now let's talk about what we know about these shoes and the construction before we start cutting them in half starting with the leather so we look at the cross-section you can tell it's a chrome tan leather because see that bluing on the inside and we also don't see any grain structure on there and what does the grain structure it's that top layer of the cross-section of whether that's a really tightly knit fiber structure that gives you that smooth leather fill if you were to look at this shoe from the outside you say hey that's pretty smooth I don't see any fuzzies on there looks like there's some pores on there but that's not the grain that is a layer of plastic with a leather looking print embossed into the leather or into the plastic and the reason they call this other splits is at the tannery leather in its natural state is pretty often too thick for whatever application they're wanting to use it for so they have to split it down into thinner thicknesses and they do that by putting it through machine that's literally just splits it in half and that top portion has that highly sought after grain structure that gives you that smooth fill and then that bottom part is the splits where it's all that fuzzy stuff and that top portion with the grain usually goes the more expensive high-end leather products that split portion is usually processed one or two ways it's the left fuzzy they call suede or they refinish that top fuzziness with a fake looking grain structure or top layer of plastic like what we see in these and it kind of just makes it look like a grain leather so split leather is usually cheaper and usually see in Cheaper products and it's not as strong and because they have to put a plastic coating on top a lot of times that plastic coating is gonna flake off and kind of split before a grain structured leather would and looking at these shoes I don't think this tongue is leather I don't think the linings leather and I don't think it's a little cap around the back is leather I think just the side panels or whether but we'll see when we cut in half next we can see this is a cup sole construction that's cemented and stitched just around the toe I don't need I don't really know if this is actual stitching or if it's just a faux stitch I guess we'll see we cut it in half and then the insole I can get it out this has a little piece of double-sided tape holding it in there and this is a north and light foam which is a little higher quality foam than just like a cheap open cell foam that feels like camping pad and then we can see that there's cattle weaved you know know what actually it looks like there's two separate so I think there's actually with this particular shoe two different insoles in there because this right shoe is kind of a fiber board and this left shoe is kind of a weaved material so that was unexpected so yeah I guess next we'll cut them in half to see what's going on inside hearing that's really weird all right I've got a cut in half let's see what's inside now let's go through the layers starting with the leather first so which piece is our leather in which part so the toe these side panels this little strip on the back here are the leather and then the liner the little heel cap here and the tongue or not leather now that we've got a nice clean cross-section let's see if I was right about the portion the leather it comes from if we take a really really close-up look I think I might actually be wrong I think there's just a little teeny sliver of grain in there so let's do a little bit test cut test think and see and if I cut just a little teeny bit off you can see there is actually a little bit of grain in there so I was wrong just like every video so it looks like the this is I doubt it's a calfskin based on the price point so it's probably what they call a top grain leather where they buff off that very top section of the grain and just leave a little bit in there makes they do that to make it and really even and consistent finish it just doesn't have as much grain that's why I love doing these actual cut in halves because you really get to see what's really going on inside these shoes now for the layers starting with the outsole so I've got this cup sole and it's surprisingly thin and the little cells on the inside of here are really loose and floppy so that's why when you put these on they're squishing it first it's not because there's lots of foam in there it's because these cells are super loose and after a while these are going to compress and break it's gonna be a little uncomfortable that's probably why these we're out faster than a premium shoe and then we move up to the insult which is kind of a surprise question this episode is is this the same insole on the left shoe as the right so I'm going to cut a little slit route of this one to see if it's the same material okay we got the little sliver taken out and after looking at it I can see that it is the same material from the left to the right shoe ones just put the one way the others look the other way so I don't know if that's a quality control issue or if it's a way that they do the manufacturing from the left shoe to the right shoe I definitely know and then to the last question I had before cutting these in half does this stitch around the toe a real structural stitch or is it just like a postage for looks if you look inside here you can see the stitching does stitch the upper to the sole so that's good to see so the last thing what is the difference between the Stan Smith's and the premium shoes that we have done and probably will continue to do the three main things that I noticed was the first thing in the Stan Smith's are going to get a cheaper a leather one that's gonna have a plastic coating on top and you're gonna get some fake leather the next thing was the way that it's built so on the Stan Smith's you guys really really thin matted material that as you wear this these little cells on the inside alright don't have the structure to compress evenly and you're gonna get some high spots and low spots in the heel and it's just not going to it's not going to mold to the shape of your foot like a fiber board and a compressed cardboard is going to do like in the premium ones and then do the final thing so that is the construction so this is mostly a cemented construction with some stitching on it versus the more premium ones are going to have a stitch line all the way through and a higher-quality sole so those are the three main differences it's kind of up to you if you are ok with those things 80 bucks you can usually get them on sale for a little bit cheaper not a bad price not a bad shoe got some leather in it but they're not gonna last as long so that pretty much wraps it up and let me know what you guys think do you think they're worth the money do you think I missed something in here and let me know what other shoes you want to do and let the companies know which shoes you want to see if there's on this channel cuz it helps me get sponsors and helps you see the shoes you want to see and don't forget the Father's Day wallet cell and the re-release of the Clayton wallet use the code what was it leather dad for 10% off and a free set of coasters thanks for everything you guys do see ya,2025-06-19 08:39:23.922754 UTC

HUwGgJcUxX0,ASICS GEL-LYTE III,foreign for the very first time in fact not just a sneaker but a brand as well and you've already seen that title in the thumbnail the sneaker that I'm gonna review today is an A6 sneaker and the sneaker is is six gel light three I'm not talking about the sneakers here so the sneakers originally released in 1990 these were the third model in the gel light series by Asics these are one of the most famous I'm one of the most comfortable sneakers of A6 when it comes to their lifestyle range yes initially or earlier I would say 1990s these sneakers were used as for running for jogging one for all of those purposes but lately they are more of Lifestyle shoe now because obviously we have got much much better sneakers when it comes to running and talking in everything and yes this is one of the most famous A6 model out there and one model that has got a lot of collaborations one of the most famous being one with Sean Witherspoon if you're not aware about Sean with a spoon Sean with a spoon is an independent designer that has done a lot of collaborations and is known worldwide uh he is one of the most famous work was with Air Max 97 and then he after that he did the a6j light 3 and after that he has also done the Adidas Superstars now getting a little bit more into detail of the sneaker here so as you can see it is one color sneaker so the top of the sneaker is basically made of ivory color the midsole and the outsole are made of green color and the leather they have used on the top of the sneaker is tumble leather and it's of a very very very premium quality this is one of the best quality leather I've seen in a very long time now the direction as you can see on the toe area it's very simple basic toe area made of the stumbled leather on both the sides you can see this A6 sign so it's same color is the reason it is not highlighted right now but if you see some other A6 gel like 3 models you will see that this A6 sign is mostly made of different color so that it is highlighted but in this one it is of the same color so it is giving this monotone look and now coming towards the tongue area of the shoe here so first of all you can see flat laces made of the same color of the shoe which is basically Ivory and beneath the laces you can see the split tongue now the idea panel is Straight Talk is to basically get more comfort and more accessibility to the foot so that you can easily you know open it like this and put your foot in though honestly I'm not a big fan of this flake tan though when I look at the shoe it looks really good but when I tried the sneakers on and I was wearing a dark brown colored sock the color of the sock was visible because my I got a purified foot and that is the reason uh the tank didn't close up properly when I was lacing them so that is one thing that I did not like about the shoe uh because if you also have got a very wide feet you might also face the same problem so the easy solution for that is to go for basically the same colored socks like I did uh later on and though it was still visible but because it was the same color and the laces were overlapping it is the reason it was not that big of a problem but yes every time when I wear these I will have to go for white socks I don't have another option uh but yes now coming towards the sock liner the sock line is also made of the same uh ivory color it is quite padded not very heavily heavily parrot but it's quite padded similarly to the tongue and talking about the insole insole is also of the same ivory color has got this A6 grinding on the top uh this is not that padded I would say it is very lightly padded I was expecting a little more padding in the insole but when I try the sneakers on feet they were quite comfortable uh so if I talk about the reader price the retail price is 10 000 rupees and I was lucky enough to get this sneakers for anywhere around 5500 rupees from rgo so rgo time to time bring up their really good sale and these were going for approximately six thousand six thousand five hundred rupees and then they had another coupon on the top of that and I ended up getting these for 5500 rupees and I feel that getting such a Timeless Classics didn't go for 5500 Rupees is an amazing deal and yes I will be putting down the links down in the description so that you can check it out for yourself now I'm not sure if these things are available right now or not the last time I checked they offer in fact this photo model was available in a lot of different colors so that you guys can check out some other colors as well I went for this ivory creamish color because as I mentioned earlier I love white on light colored singers and I do wear white sneakers the most you know though I got a lot of colored sneakers in my collection I bought almost every colored single in my collection but one color that I wear the most is white because it is very easy to style uh and wear white colored sneakers and they go with everything now talking about the sizing here so I am a UK 9 or a US 10 and I went for my true size and I feel the sneakers fit really well but again yes if you have got a very very wide feet go for probably half a size or probably a one size up but yes if you go to normal or just a slightly wide foot you can always go for your true size the sneakers fit really well now overall I feel it's a very very good show and I'm really happy that I'm trying a new sneaker this year uh but yes at the same time I would say that I would not pay the full MRP 10 000 rupees on these sneakers and I would only recommend if you can get these sneakers for a discounted price for anywhere around five to six thousand rupees anything above 7000 rupees would probably a bit costly according to me so try and find these sneakers for anywhere around 6000 rupees you can always check on rgo RG has got some great colors in these sneakers but yes overall singers are really good and I feel the sneakers are definitely a must try from the brand A6 and from the series of A6 gel light all right so we're gonna end the video over here thank you so much for watching the video till the end and if you like the video do the thumbs up button down there and comment down below what you think about these sneakers or have you ever tried a pair of Asics Gel night 3 in the past or not and yes if you

GesSiJjpywY,Nike Cortez,foreign how's it going everybody it's Sean here back today to give you guys a review of this size Nike Cortez in this flat cuter colorway today's video is always is sponsored by heffalux when it comes to sneakers Comfort is king So when you buy a pair of shoes and find out they're uncomfortable one of the easiest ways to fix that is to swap out the insoles so that's where heffalux comes into play if you check out their website which I've linked Down Below in the description box you'll see they sell a variety of etpu insoles which really is the same material you'll find inside adidas Boost so if you guys are curious to try a pair for yourself be sure to use the code Sean go at checkout and take 15 off your entire purchase and be sure to tell them I say you so this right here is a size exclusive Nike Cortez the official colorway for this shoe is flat pewter dark obsidian and sale and these retailed for a price of 145 Canadian dollars which is the equivalent to roughly 105 US dollars converted and I want to give a huge thank you over to size Canada for sending me over this pair currently these are sitting on the size Canada website so if you guys are curious to check them out I'll add a direct link down below for you guys to buy these so the Nike Cortez is one of Nike's most important and most historical sneakers of all time which debuted back in 1972 and after all these years it stood the test of time it's still one of Nike's Flagship models even though it might have a bit more of a niche and cult following compared to some of the other Silhouettes like for example an Air Force One or some of the shoes in the air max line still the Cortez is very famous in its own right and we're still seeing exclusive colorways released in 2023 just like this one so taking a deep dive into the details first off running down the toe box we have this Gray colored suede which is a very fuzzy long-haired Suede and it feels very plush to the touch the same suede covers the eye stays of the shoe and it's cut in this Jagged fashion and then surrounding the side panels of the shoe we also have a gray suede here but this suede is completely perforated all across overlaid on top of this mid panel we have this dark blue colored swoosh and the same dark blue leather covers the top portion of the heel and press the cross we have Nike branding in white beneath this wrapping around the bottom of the heel we have more of that shaggy long-haired suede that we saw earlier on the middle of the toe box and then as we turn our attention back to the front so attached to the laces these come with a metallic lace debris or lace lock and here we have Cortez 72 branding and as far as the laces go so these come with two different lace options the standard default lace is a flat style lace in the sail or cream color and this lace feels very broken and very vintage to the touch but if you're not feeling these laces they also give you a mixed gray and blue colored lace as well but for me I like the more vintage look of these cream laces so that's what I'm going to lace my shoe with underneath this we have your typical nylon tongue and to give it more of that vintage look the nylon is colored in this dark cream color and at the very top we have a white tag with the Nike logo in blue so the interior of the back half of the shoe is lined in this white colored synthetic leather which while it's not a genuine leather it still gives the shoe a bit more of an elevated look and feel and then as far as the insoles go so these come with your typical foam lined insole and it's lined in this orange colored textile on the top and we have Nike branding stamped on the heel in white so the upper of the Nike Cortez sits atop as basic foam midsole which is painted in this cream color but you'll see on the back half of the midsole we have a secondary layer of foam and this layer here is done in a dark blue color and then underneath the foam we have this basic Rubber outsole and this is done in the sail color and just like any other Nike Cortez we have a herringbone style attraction pattern that runs from heel to toe and we have the Nike branding right in the center so that breaks down the look and the construction of this pair and for those wondering about sizing to me these fit like most of my other Nike Cortez's so I would personally recommend going up a half size so my feet measures as a true size 10 slightly on The Wider side meaning when I go to a shoe store and step on a brandic device the thing that measures your foot I'm actually a size 10 in between a d and an e width so for the Nike Cortez I feel like it runs a little bit short so size can has sent me this pair in a size 10 and the width of the shoe is a little bit narrow but the length of the shoe is where the major problem is so rocking these true to size my toe is already hitting the edge of the shoe so because of that a 10 and a half would have been ideal for me so that's why I recommend you guys to go up a half size but if you're someone who's historically fine sticking true to size for the Cortez then I'd stick with that same size for this pair as well moving on to the Comfort so unfortunately the Cortez isn't that comfortable of a shoe keep in mind this is a model from 1972 and the tech is extremely outdated it's just a very basic foam underfoot so with that said to me at least it's not really a comfortable shoe whatsoever you can feel some of that compression of the foam but it's really nothing to write home about and I've never really been a huge fan of the Cortez in general both from an aesthetic standpoint but more importantly from a comfort standpoint so if you're someone that normally likes the Cortez's then you're gonna like these but if you're looking for a very comfortable sneaker to wear every day then I feel like there's a lot better models out there that I can recommend to you finally in terms of the overall quality and craftsmanship so first off material quality I thought it was decent suede like I mentioned before have this nice buttery feel to it and it doesn't have a synthetic felt like feel like a lot of Nike shoes utilize so at least from a material standpoint it was decent and from a build and craft strip standpoint I thought my pair was pretty solid there honestly wasn't any real major issues that I could see maybe a little bit of glue stains around the swoosh but after really examining these in person there's really nothing that I can complain about so I thought the Nike Factory that put these together did a pretty solid job foreign so with all that out of the way now let me toss these on feet I'll lace them up and I show you guys how these look like I mentioned earlier the Nike Cortez just isn't one of my favorite models when it comes to Nike shoes but looking at this objectively I think this is a decent pair it really has a vintage Vibe and feel to it in this colorway with a mix of gray and blue I'd say that it's a fairly easy shoe to pull off especially if this is a shoe you're considering to rock as your everyday sort of sneaker aside from that though I think the price point is also very enticing nowadays here in Canada I'm so used to shoes that cost 200 to 300 Canadian dollars so it's pretty refreshing to see an option being priced at 145 Canadian dollars instead so let me know in the comment section down below what you guys think about the size Nike Cortez and this flat pewter colorway what are your overall thoughts on this pair and let me know down below are you a fan of the Nike Cortez is it not really a model for you either way drop a comment and let's talk about this silhouette if you guys like this video be sure to like comment and subscribe

kocfVdL31ec,ASICS GEL-LYTE III,foreign what's up everybody it's Sean here here today to give you guys a review of the A6 gel A3 OG and this baked pink and French blue colorway today's video is brought to you by heffalux heffalux is my all-time favorite sneaker insoles and they sell ETP insoles which really is the same material you'll find inside adidas Boost so if you're looking at some additional Comfort inside your shoes be sure to check out their website which I've linked Down Below in the description box you'll see they sell a variety of different insoles so depending on the type of insole density and the cushioning setup you're looking for you're going to find there's a suitable pair for anyone so I've been a pain customer pepalux for years now and I personally find them to be very comfortable so if you guys want to check them out and try a pair for yourself be sure to use the code Sean go at checkout to get 15 off your entire purchase so this is a relatively new general release A6 July 3 which I picked up a couple weeks back so this is officially called the baked pink and French blue colorway and they retailed for 130 US dollars or 160 here in Canada so my initial thought when I first saw the colorway of this shoe is that it kind of reminds me of the a few Asics collaboration on the koi colorway with a slight mix of the kith salmon toe collab and because I don't own a pair of that koi collaboration with a few this was a pair that I was really curious to pick up and see how they were in real life so diving into the details of this shoe the front half of the sneaker on the toe box you can see this is constructed out of a pale pink colored suede this entire suede panel here on the toolbox is perforated and surrounding the front toe cap we have more that pale pink colored suede as well but this part is UN perforated next to this covering the eyelets we have this tan colored Suede and the middle two eyelets are constructed out of a pink colored TPU we have more of that beige suede covering the bottom of the mid panel as well and then in between this we have this perforated white leather and overlaid on top of this we have the A6 Stripes which is constructed out of a navy blue colored leather with a white layer underneath moving downwards surrounding the bottom of the heel and wrapping around the back we have more of that pink colored Suede and we have gel light 3 embroidered on the lateral side only and above this we have more that beige colored Suede and we have Asics embroidered in blue and the word gel below that embroidered in pink this being a gel light 3 of course we have that signature split tongue down the middle and the tongue here is constructed out of a white colored leather as far as the laces go so these come with these flat style laces in white and they have these pink colored lace tips and then the interior of the shoe is lined in this pale pink color textile which matches the color of the suede perfectly as far as the insole goes so these come with your standard foam line insole it's lined in a pale pink colored textile on top and we have A6 branding stamped on the heel in blue so the upper of the gel light 3 sits atop this white colored foam midsole and we have Asics branding found on the middle of the lateral side in case within the shoe but not visible to the eye we have Asics Gel technology which gives the shoe a ton of cushioning and comfort and then right above this surrounding the bottom of the heel we have this pale pink color TPU heel clip which gives you additional structure and support for the back end of the shoe finally flipping the shoe over to the bottom this is just your standard gel like 3 outsole and this is entirely constructed out of a dark blue colored rubber and in the middle you can see we have the A6 board mark so that breaks down the look and the construction of this pair for those wondering about sizing I feel like historically in the past maybe let's say five to ten years ago jet light 3's to me at least fit a lot more snug so I used to go up a half size but I found that for more recent gel light threes I can go true to size with these and they fit perfectly fine so my feet measures as a true size 10 they're slightly on The Wider side as well I got these in a size 10 and they fit me perfectly so whatever size you normally wear for recent gel i3s I'd stick with that same size for this pair moving on to the Comfort so the gel I3 in my opinion is an extremely comfortable shoe for casual use it's a little bit more on the softer side but it's not overly soft and mushy it still gives you a good amount of support as well and these are one of my top picks when people ask me for shoes that I consider to be the most comfortable so straight out of the box you can feel that compression and the softness of that foam midsole but with the inclusion of the gel technology it gives you a good amount of responsiveness and bounce back finally in terms of the overall quality and the craftsmanship on this shoe so first off material quality I just thought it was okay I feel like these are a little bit worse in quality than most my other Asics in my collection which I guess makes sense considering this is a general release and it's not to say the material quality is bad I just thought the suedes felt a little bit scratchy and thin and the leather on the tongue felt a little bit synthetic but I guess for the price that you're paying you still get decent materials they're just not great materials but from a craftsmanship and build standpoint I thought this pair was pretty flawless I didn't notice any flaws or issues no glue stains no loose stitching nothing like that so at least from that standpoint it was very solid foreign so with all that out of the way now let's toss these on feet and I'll show you guys how these look foreign release A6 release this is a very very nice colorway and one that caught my attention right from the beginning like I mentioned from the start this is basically a takedown version of the a few koi A6 gel like 3. so for anyone that doesn't own a pair of those this is a very solid alternative I think this is a very great spring or summer colorway and when you combine that with the comfort of the Asic Gel light 3 this is a perfect pairing so let me know in the comment section down below what you guys think about this colorway I'm guessing these will eventually go on sale if they're not already so if you can grab these for under retail that would be a definite no-brainer in my opinion if you guys like this

NM_mH3o8K9I,Adidas Samba,fun fact a shoe that was originally released in 1949 is currently trending today in 2023 hey what's good guys my name's Chris welcome back to the official wear testers.com YouTube channel today uh I thought it might be fun to look at a shoe that's currently trending why are they trending because they're simple and classic looking but these have been around since literally 1949 but like they've even been not trending were things trending back when we were kids I mean I'm sure they were but that probably wasn't the the term used like kwis was trending Sketchers was once trending you know what I mean but like these have just kind kind of always been in the consumer Zeitgeist like this was the Adidas outlet special forever so the fact that they are actually hard to obtain in store is insane to me but there's an option for that these guys right now are available under retail believe it or not in multiple sizes over at stockx they're also available with their new Express Ship where you can just like they go straight away like no waiting for a seller to package get to you and all that stuff so they don't have to like go through all the different hands which I thought was very interesting and because of that stockx actually wanted to sponsor this video and we said cut the check stockx just introduced its new Express Ship service where items are prever verified and ready to ship immediately no waiting for a seller to package ship to a stockx hub go through its verification process get it repackaged and then sent to you the items available for Express Ship are sourced from a select group of stockx sellers the sellers do set the prices for these items but again a lot of them are under retail such as the samb OG and as a buyer if you make a purchase from one of their Express Ship items stockx will immediately send them out for an additional $10 fee and then it'll be delivered in about three business days which is awesome if you happen to be a YouTuber that reviews shoes now they did say that we can actually pick something out and buy it uh to give away so I'm going to give something away to one of you guys right now I'm going to see what they have available for Express Ship Express Ship by the way does have a little rocket logo and it literally says Express Ship right next to it so it's pretty clear which one's which oh okay red cements I love a pair of fours you guys already know that so we're going to pick our size and then check out oh my God thank you shipping provider and here we are pre verified and ready to give away so if you're interested in checking out stock X's Express Ship feature make sure that you click the link Down Below in our description box it'll head you over to stock X's website or app where you can check everything out and if you see anything that You' like you can uh go ahead and check out and just wear a helmet now as far as the samba OG is concerned uh again this is a trending sneaker that is available currently in many different places stockx being one of them if you wanted to save some cash and grab them for under retail the shoe is not Tech heavy whatsoever it was originally intended as a football sneaker and by football I don't mean like American football I'm talking about like actual football football uh apparently the shoe itself was enabling players to practice or train on icy or hard ground without ruining like a cleat and stuff like that so I do think that it's an interesting look they eventually became kind of an indoor football or soccer if you're American type of shoe and now obviously they have transitioned into something trendy but even though they have been a staple on the feet of many people for decades what do they actually feature though uh not much just to let you guys know so getting them for under retail is the move I will say for comparison purposes if you're going to compare this to something around the same price point as a Nike sneaker at least the materials here are way nicer than anything you'll get over there so there is that tech-wise though same thing there isn't much as far as the outsole is concerned I really like it but it's because it's iconic it's kind of classic and everything there's not much to it as far as gimmicks Thrills Frills all that stuff but it's there it's simple it's nice when you read about how it's supposed to like hard surfaces or icy surfaces you kind of get what this little like weird I don't even know what to call this um but it's like bumpy and not spiky but kind of so you can see where they're coming from I think that it's very cool as far as the rest of the out soole which is basically one whole piece it is a cupsole and it's on the floor so if you're looking for a minimalist Barefoot type of feel this is kind of like something that you can start off with they are not a Barefoot shoe though so they're not like foot shaped so there's not spay room and all that stuff like a zero shoe would be but again it's it's something that's very interesting cuz it's so simple it's so clean you can wear this with damn near anything and get away with it and on top of that there's so many different material options too not just colors and materials but I'm talking about literal material options so this one right here is more along the lines of the actual OG hence the OG name where we've got leather we've got suede it's all over the place the tongue though is a little bit different so we've got a very thin cut leather tongue very nice it's actual leather you could see it in the cut line and everything but some of the SAS have a football style tongue where it's a little bit longer it's elongated it's kind of like a I don't want to call it a full shin guard because it doesn't go up that high but it's a guard and everything so it's interesting remember those I'm like picturing the ones where they almost come back down on top of the laces right it goes up and then folds okay so you're saying that one yeah okay that's like the soccer version or the football version and I believe that's to attach itself to the ball not literally but like so you have a little bit more control when you're cuing you know what I'm saying like doing tricks and then kicking it and stuff so I had no idea I think that's what it's for I could be wrong this tongue is obviously not performance tongue this is just a lifestyle tongue so uh this is the more simple version but what I really like about these is that again there's many different material options so if you love leather then this is an option for you if you don't maybe you're a vegan and you don't want to wear animal products on your feet or at all there's actual like plant-based versions which is really cool so go to Adidas's website if you wanted to check out all of their different varieties and then that way you can actually Google search or search on stockx or wherever you're looking at and use the actual name so you can find the specific version that you're looking for now as far as the insole is concerned that's really the only comfort that you're getting and yes it's a cheap piece of uh if you wanted to pull it out you can if you wanted to add a little bit of comfort and maybe some torsional rigidity cuz this is one of those shoes that it's just there's nothing in there then you might want to go with a move insole if you wanted to something that is not going to lift you completely out of the shoe and everything go with one of their regular insoles which would be the performance version there is the game day and the game day Pro I would recommend the game day because the shank plate is not quite as stiff so it's a little bit softer underneath your arches and stuff if you're not used to that but if you wanted something with a little bit more cushion then you can go with there all day just know that that insole is a lot thicker than the one that comes in here so it will alter the fit it'll make the toe box a little more snug it'll also lift your heel just a little bit which some people might not like so in that case you might want to go up half a size in the sneaker however sizing for most people is going to be true to size they fit perfect I really like the way that these fit I like the way that they look too I just don't know if they work with my cankles I bet your ankles would look really good in those I don't know no you look really good in low top shoes she's biased no I appreciate your legs a shs but with all that being said thank you guys so much for watching thank you so much for being here we greatly appreciate hanging out with you guys I didn't finish saying appreciate just like cut off the word no you're just doing your best Charles Barkley I'm pretty sure that's how he would say

are going to click checkout damn okay so we're just going to pick our size add to cart and then check out Jesus gosh why does it have to bounce off me like that you're throwing that really hard you told me to my shoulder hurts that was my co shot are we good we'll do it one more time this time I think I'm going to try to catch it,2025-06-19 08:40:57.862675 UTC
X1VACUYkYP8,Stan Smith,good day there How are you i've got the Adidas Originals men's Stan Smith sneaker here These are size 14 so quite large The Stan Smith line has been going for about 50 years I think So these are like a classic real easy wearing shoe It's got a rubber sole and you've got your stitching around the bottom there You've got um a leather upper as well That's how we're looking around the back The lace ups of course And then on the tongue you've got your iconic Stan Smith logo right there These are of course the white with the green trim but you can get other colors as well It says machine wash but I don't know I just generally use a bit of um soapy water and a cloth and then just dry them off afterwards I think that does the does the job pretty well as well I don't like the idea of them smashing around in the in the washing machine So with the laces of course you can get a bit more of a snugger fit And one thing I really like about what Adidas is up to at the moment or Adidas sorry if I'm saying that wrong is that they are introducing or have introduced and using more recycled materials which um is really important to me and if it is for you then these would be the way to go There's also a we note just saying size down by about half a size as the Stan Smith shoes tend to um be quite a large fit So that's just something to bear in mind as well So there we go That's the Adidas or Adidas classic men's Stan Smith sneaker A a timeless classic look with the uh the planet in mind A really nice simple yet very stylish shoe I love these guys and I'm sure you will,2025-06-19 08:39:27.899597 UTC

p0MTQJAgIqs,Adidas Gazelle,hello YouTube and uh welcome back and um I want to do like real real quick run through this uh this is latest purchase uh I decided to replace my old Adidas Samba which I had for about 5 years I think five or six years and they pretty you know worm out you know it's got almost like a hole in here and the so and I love them this is actually natural leather also like upper leather was you know but I hand them I try to was them and you know they you know they getting old and I decided you know went on I did this website and decided to go with different it's also originals but this is a gazelle model this is green and white I don't know if you can see the serial number or model number anyway so let's open up and do like real quick run through and later I'm going to put them on and you guys will see how they fit on me and uh just want to say I'm huge you know I grew up you know probably my first sneakers was Adidas and you know I'm old school I like kind of like this classic kind of Timeless design with three stripes uh so I this is probably my fifth or sixth pair of Adidas in the last 25 years and uh so I decided to do it again but this time the price was um H pretty hefty I think $120 and that's pretty crazy because this ones just you know 5 years ago was about 50 you know speaking of inflation this is pretty insane and as we know the sellers didn't grow up that fast so I was pretty uh hesitant about it and pretty skeptical but let's open up run through real quick uh and you know it's it's a it's a good good quality uh this ones actually run true to the size and keep in mind this is very narrow box oh here this is uh LOB books for those of you had like a wider feet get one size up or you know half size up because this is I don't know why but they designed when I think they designed in ' 70s and ' 80s it and it it always like this kind of like designed for narrow fit and I have a narrow fit for me it's fine and I still going half size you know or the size up and this is true the size because the old the sambba they actually was running small and I purchased in the store and that's why they size 10 but I always buy sneakers a little larger because I put like a thicker sock because this is all seasons you can wear them in the winter so you know you can spray with a silicone waterproof spray and good to go I love this so you can see this is pretty cool and um let's get all the details anyway so um this comes also want to one little detail that comes with extra laces which is like a white color you can put like a you know but I do like the green actually so but it's up to you but it's a nice touch uh insole is not unfortunately not removable I think I mentioned this and uh it just stays in there would be nice to have removal because you can just throw it a washing machine and and do the quick wash uh but that's not dealbreaker I think for some people deal breaker could be um actually the price I think this is 120 this is kind of a crazy so uh we may probably we enter in in different kind of a phase whereas we're not going back to 50 bucks anymore and I think looks like price is never going down so unfortunately but again if you buy it once like I do once since six years five and six years I certainly can afford it you know but this is something to consider I think this is biggest biggest downside is is a price I think would be to me they would worth maybe 70 you know maybe 75 bucks you know but not not 120 otherwise a great shoe and again I'm not shoe expert but they seem pretty flexible pretty durable and uh I just love it so I think it's a I just love the design and look of it and um um so yeah yeah like I said we talked I think I talked about the time this is gazelle indoors and the one which is regular gazila more designed for the soccer for the football I'm sorry and they have like a longer Tong here which is by almost half an inch even an inch could be very uncomfortable for some of you you know something to consider but otherwise it's pretty sliek looking and uh like I said uh this is classic Timeless design and people love him and that's all I have to say and um yep thank you so much for looking and you know don't go away so I'm going to put them on you'll see how they fit okay thank you for watching okay so I just put them on and uh I would say they pretty good Feit it's a little actually this run larger and let me tell you why because this is a okay let me just kind of compare this is actually old my old one and this is s it's not the same model but this is size 10 and I think this one I purchased in the store and the size 10 is actually run smaller looks like because this one fit me perfect and this is the new the gazelle they are looks like they kind of like my trueth to the size is 99 and2 I wear usually between 9 and 10 sneakers usually I get larger size so this is 9 and2 and I think it's pretty ample because keep in mind the toe box is very very small uh it's very narrow I would say not as small but as far as length they always as big as my sambers look at this I just compared them and assem is pretty much the same length and this is number 10 again so this is the green one the gazelle is 9 and2 and um there's a little subtle difference at the toe this this part of the toe box is slightly different design as you can see this one goes just straight and U this has like a little slight curve on it so a little different but it's it's cool this sued is very cool I love this sued and otherwise keep in mind guys this is all they usually this Adidas are very very narrow for like narrow feet and um you better go with one size up so otherwise you're going to be very uncomfortable in toe box so but this one is seems to be pretty good and uh I don't have any issues I think it's a pretty decent decent quality too and I actually like the this is kind of old school and I almost the reason why I got you the new ones are almost it's wearing out pretty you know probably in a 5 years or so I would say but this I think the so is pretty good A better quality it's almost like a natural rubber made they made look like natural Rubber and this is kind of like a more like a shiny so I like the new ones even this design is kind of slightly better so I don't know if you can see it I can put them on a desk and otherwise they look great and this is just true classic I I think I changed now in 30 years probably like five different pairs it's like either samb or gazelle and uh the gazelle is keep in mind that this is a indoors has a shorter this ton is slightly shorter if you get the regular there going to be right up here you know I remember purchase like 10 years ago I actually had to cut it out it was like very uncomfortable because designed for the football actually or for the soccer like they say and this is like I said this is if I spray it with the you know silicon spray the waterproof silicon spray you can it's it's a whole year round especially if you live it depends where you live in California you can wear it even in Midwest I mean so some milder winter climate so this is pretty much for me I you know it's a I would say uh even through the winter you can wear them uh you know most of the time I'm in the car anyway so yeah this is pretty nice and there's a lot of great colors the dark Blues they were not available so I got I went with a green but I do like it and the sued is perfect so again my size is regular size 9 and 1/2 this is 9 and 1/2 which is pretty much through this I could go maybe one small like half size smaller but if I wear like a thicker socks for the winter season uh you got to go like half a size up so I think uh this is just kind of like a summer suck and if I get the thicker sock you want to get warmer and U yeah thank you guys for watching okay and let me just show a little more up close change the camera so that you can see more details here yeah and you see this this slightly different design than um you know my samb but otherwise it's pretty pretty beautiful color actually you know I I probably my first green shoes I never had one and um I'm not big on green or red but this one is actually looking pretty good and uh yeah so that's a so again pretty cool pattern has a good truction if you do skateboarding just walking and running I think they they that's what I love about them they can do anything so pretty much uh or going to going out to the theater so okay thanks again for watching and please comment and um subscribe please if you like like it and put some likes and um see you in a few weeks,2025-06-23 14:39:01.361527 UTC
oBlLc3rHRP0,ASICS GEL-LYTE III,hello and welcome to the workshop today's video is a doozy and I don't know if I've ever used that word before in my entire life but it's kind of the only word that fits a doozy years in the making when I tell you years if you follow me on instagram at mr. palmer simpson then you have seen these many many times since the inception of my instagram account is that the right word okay no answer from buckets he's leaving me out to dry on my vocabulary adventures this has been a long time coming and you have also seen many update videos like this one right here buckets and eye buckets who's not saying anything he is behind the camera he is my brother for those of you who don't know and we like to wear our sneakers man it's just as simple as that and we usually do an update after a month or so sometimes a few months this was more than half a decade let that sink in six years this is an official update on the Asics GEL light three pros and cons after 6 years of wearing well technically I think it's five years and nine months but in this case I think we can round up in that time period I have worn these probably as much as any other sneaker I've owned in fact a couple years ago I basically sold my entire collection some of you may remember that and this was one of the handful of sneakers that I kept the New York ECP gel light three by Ronnie five buckets and I were actually in Miami for this release they released a Miami Dolphin colorway alongside of these and since then this pair you know being from New York being a huge fan of the Knicks and I just loved the sneaker they've been a staple since then sure sometimes I've worn them more than others it's like I wear them every day for six years but these have been heavily heavily worn I mean just look at the stress lines in the midsole and you can tell these things have seen some [ __ ] and there's still trucking so for starters let's talk about comfort they are just as comfortable as they wore back then they really really are they've been super consistent now is it an unbelievably comfortable shooting I'd say it's probably a seven out of ten maybe even a six but they've maintained at that level it isn't a shoe that breaks in and gets way more comfortable it also isn't a shoe that gets way less comfortable it's just it's slow and steady it's like the tortoise in the race to coziness I don't know if that makes sense but sounded better in my head now when you put this many miles on a sneaker when this much time passes it's worth it to note that the sneakers still fully intact and it's still holding up really really well and trust me when I tell you I didn't wear these carefully I just put them on and lived my life no cleaners or crease protectors or the little things that you put on the outsole so the bottoms don't get dirty none of that I just lived life and they've held up incredibly well all things considered another thing to note or mention is the value right there was a time right after these release time probably for the year or two that followed where these were reselling four six seven hundred bucks and now they're maybe 250 300 dollars I mentioned it to kind of prove a point we always talk about patience saves pockets but it's true and of course there's every sneaker drop in value no sometimes it goes the other way but a lot of them do eventually and sneakers in general they're kinda up and down it's just about being patient and staying on the hunt the popularity of runners in general has really cooled off back in 2012 2013 runners especially collabs they were on fire Ronnie five concepts other sneaker boutiques it was just booming and now not so much there's an ebb and flow to everything sometimes it's up sometimes it's down I guess it's kind of like the stock market that way such as life I'm just I'm proving a point but also in today's day and age where some sneakers are so valuable and there are all these resale values and it does fluctuate so much when you're talking about an update six years later I just think it's a very relevant topic to discuss or address and now in these update videos we always talk about the pros and the cons the good the bad the ugly there isn't really too much negative to say about the sneaker probably the only thing would be the materials I got pretty lucky but suede I mean I love suede it looks beautiful it feels beautiful but it just isn't great when going against the elements for lack of a better word snow rain even stains or you spill a drink no bueno with leather it's a lot more resilient that's a lot more sustainable and I guess maybe the comfort could be considered a negative if you wanted to kind of nitpick it's not like some super ultra comfortable sneaker when you compare it to some of the more comfortable sneakers on the market but it's comfortable enough it's not a sneaker eery like damn I think it's above average as far as comfort goes and like I said it stays very very steady so I don't look at that aspect as a negative it's a well-made shoe it holds up really well and that's the short verdict I think it's one of the best shoes Ronnie fight has ever done and he's done some really cool stuff so it's not like that doesn't mean much I mean that's saying something how do you feel about him no do you own a pair of gel light threes do you remember this particular release buckets and I do like I said we were in Miami we were ready to go this was a sneaker that we really really wanted are you in a six-person however you're feeling leave a comment

f81mCoiE2Bw,Veja Esplar,"here are all the reasons I will sadly not be repurchasing my Vega campos and what I am buying to replace them or what I have bought to replace them i'm also sorry for the door being open but it's in case my golden retriever wants to come visit um I do not make the rules in this house so you may have seen a video in which I unbox these lovely trainers and in that video I talk about all the reasons that I was excited to have purchased them the amount of thought that had gone into purchasing them and all of these things and whilst I absolutely stand by all of those reasons I love Vega as a company i think they are absolutely going about things in the right way i think the impetus behind the creation of the brand is is brilliant i I'm really so for them in so many ways however having owned a pair of these trainers now for like I say nearly 2 years I won't be repurchasing them sadly and I feel like I do need to explain why so the first sort of reason is that these are made out of vegan leather that just means plastic there's no real way around that i know that there are some sort of plant-based vegan leathers now and that's great obviously this kind of technology will just continue to develop brilliant but the problem with that is that these are the least breathable shoes I have ever worn and I mean you know forgive me if that's TMI but they really are there is no ventilation in them which does mean that these are actually quite waterproof for a trainer so you know that will put that in their you know in their favor but your feet get so hot in these and now generally during the winter I have a pair of like high top trainers that I tend to wear because they just keep your ankles a bit warmer so I'm generally wearing these in the summer or the spring summer you know when the weather is warmer okay non- breathable shoe warm weather i'll let you make draw your own conclusions so they're actually not comfortable to be wearing and the other reason there's a few reasons they're not very comfortable the other reason and you'll see that I have actually tried to combat this and actually quite successfully combed it by putting in a little insert in here they are totally unsupportive of your foot now most trainers are completely unsupportive of your foot now the brand of trainer that I have chosen to replace these actually is one of the ones I find more supportive so we'll get on to that in a second but I had to put one of these little inserts in because I have quite a high arch in my foot and I was just finding that basically the first brill like stretch of time that I wore these for I was uh I was working and I was stood playing on a stage for hours a day for about a week and I cannot describe to you the pain that my feet were in it honestly I could barely walk i was getting back to the room every night and having to like use a tennis ball to sort of massage my feet it was bad so if you are standing up for a long period of time these are not comfortable the other thing that made them not very comfortable you can kind of see it there by the way sorry for just sort of shoving a used shoe in your face i will wash my hands thoroughly after filming this but it's just there the it's the only way I can really show you can you see how it is worn at the back there and this happened really quite quickly now I should have I should preface all of this by saying I have worn these a lot because I love the look of them i absolutely love the look of them they're great they go with absolutely everything like I said they're quite waterproof for a trainer so when it's raining in the summer I've generally had these on and they've been great for that can you tell i'm really conflicted um but yeah these wore away and so they really now rub my heel these have gotten less comfortable the more I've owned them and I think that's also a bit of a problem with the vegan leather design is that obviously vegan leather doesn't soften with wear whereas if this was a leather pair of trainers they would have softened and molded to my foot and done all the things so yeah so they were just really quite uncomfortable another reason that I will not be repurchasing them is the way they've worn here you can really see that obviously you know as my foot has bent this has creased really really badly and well I say really really badly like it's fine but I like to wear these for work i'm a musician and for rehearsals and stuff you know we we can wear casual clothes it's fine but I've started to feel like these are a bit shabby really for work and that's not there i can't fix that like I couldn't have done anything to not for that to not happen if that makes sense so yes those are all the reasons for just kind of hating on this shoe i don't hate like I say I wanted and I did love this shoe i have loved wearing it but I have loved it less the longer I've owned it because it's it's gotten more and more uncomfortable like I say I've done various little things like inserts and stuff to make it more comfortable but ultimately it hasn't worked out for me and like I say I'm sad because I still love the look of them and I still put these on going ""Oh yeah but they look great and I really love how they look."" And then I spend like I get to the end of the day and I've got blisters on my heels and I'm like ""Yeah that's not the point of a trainer these are supposed to be really comfortable."" So yeah I'm so sorry VA i wanted not that they will see this video but I really wanted to love these and I'm probably not going to throw them out because like I said I mean they are just plastic so what's going to happen to these so I'm probably just going to hold on to them and wish I could wear them which is a bit sad and should really not do that but I think they do i mean I don't know their rest of their lines super super well but I know a few people that said they haven't found them that comfortable i don't know if they do do any leather shoes now if they do then maybe I would consider those but you know this this was a £140 pair of trainers i'm pretty sure it was 140 that's that's not that's not cheap okay it's not in the upper echelons by any stretch but it's not cheap and for that amount of money yes I know you're buying an ethical product and that do not get me wrong is hugely important and that is actually a slight criticism I potentially have of the trainers that I've chosen to buy uh to replace these you that was a that was a tussle that I had and so obviously like I say I love what these guys are doing i love the ethos i love the thinking behind it but sadly for me I'm not going to be repurchasing this and I felt like I should share that after the Yeah the video that I had unboxing these has done very well on my channel lots of people have seen it and I feel like I owe all those people a bit of a follow-up okay hands thoroughly washed feels weird holding your shoes when you're like kind of been walking around the floor but like I say it's the only one I can show you so I have purchased a pair of trainers which are the replacements to these and they they are probably going to come as no surprise to anyone because this pair of shoes went absolutely nutso about a year ago everyone and their dog had these shoes in fact I'm pretty sure I did see an Instagram somebody's dog wearing little baby versions anyway they went absolutely everywhere and of course that meant I went ""No I don't want the shoes that everybody else has i want something a bit different and I was pr proudly wearing my VES uh limping around my blisters and so I didn't Oh look they're trying to escape it's like a little spider leg isn't it pop that pop that back in there but I've had pairs of Adidas or Adidas however you say it trainers before and I have always loved them they suit the shape of my foot really really well and going back to the problem of standing for hours and having really you know really painful feet I did the same event the year before wore my Adidas Gazels all week and you know I mean yes I was stood up for hours a day so yes my feet were tired but they didn't hurt and so I was like okay when when I realized I wasn't going to be repurchasing those I started thinking about what I might like to get instead i wanted a shoe that was super super versatile i wanted something that was wellmade and was going to last me and primarily I wanted a shoe that was going to go with everything i was going to buy a black pair of Adidas gazels example a because I had those those were the sho the the Adidas that I had before and they like they were so comfy i loved how they looked loved the aesthetic of them but if I'm buying shoes to replace the vases then really they've got to go with stuff that you know white trainers will go with i want to be able to wear these like with dresses and things in the summer anyway enough chat i'm not embarrassed to show you these i I will explain why I went for these exact ones when I've got them out so these are the Adidas sambber originals and now yes they are in this color way which I know many people bought and loved and wore to absolute death and I know loads of people came out and said you know oh this was a trend and they've kind of gone now and they're kind of right but I have recently seen a few people here and there still wearing these and every time I've seen somebody wearing them I'm like I really really love that trainer it's such a good design because you've got the gray the white and the black it literally goes with everything particularly if you're wearing you know widelegg trousers say you're wearing like a beigy kind of widelegg trouser you've got the brown and the kind of grayy color they go if you're wearing black jeans you've got the black they go if you're wearing blue jeans all of these colors go they just work now I'd be interested to see if I can style these with dresses that's the only thing that's going against them but equally I don't really wear trainers and dresses a lot anyway it's not part of my regular wardrobe rotation so I'm really really excited to be styling these and wearing these i just really love the design of them i love how slim they are but equally they still have that slightly wider fit here which will mean that your foot can kind of move and bend they are suede and leather so liqu if you are also buying suede shoes please proof them i shall be doing that immediately but because they are leather these are going to breathe so your foot is not going to get quite so uncomfortable they have more of the arch support i do have some more little inserts if they are required it's not the worst thing that I'm going to have to do and I'm going to have to cut off all the little labels and things something I will say though if you are buying a pair of Adidas trainers is that I have to size up a half size in almost all of their designs i have a pair of the campus I think they are and in the suede and I have those in my regular size but in these I have sized up half size because that was my only problem really with my gazels i loved them but they were always just that tiny bit too small if I did a lot of walking in them the my just the edge of my toe would just feel a little bit tender because it kind of been squashed a little bit so I've sized up a half size in these and they fit perfectly so I would just say that just be aware because of the slightly slimmer design of these going up half a size just means you can adjust the laces and just give you you know tighten them up a little bit rather than having to like constantly feel like you're trying to loosen them and then they're a bit too short this way and yeah not not ideal so yeah let me know what you think would you have made the same decision do you disagree do you think these shoes are completely overdone i would agree with you on that point if you are one of those people apart from the fact that I think the people that were wearing these because they were a trend piece have now stopped wearing them and therefore the only people that are left wearing them are the ones that actually really just liked the design and I don't that that sounds a tiny bit snobbish i don't mean it to but genuinely I just really really like these and I think that goes for any kind of trend piece if it is something that you genuinely really enjoy the look of the aesthetic of it'll work really well with everything in your wardrobe and you know you will continue to wear it after it stops being a trend then go for it doesn't it it literally doesn't matter unless it is your job to show the latest trends crack on but to be honest all of us are just kind of making do with what we've got adding the odd new piece as we go and I will say these are also my one item one fashion item a month purchase for February did I buy these in March no these are my March ones i have a different February one which I actually haven't shown you yet so I'll probably record a little short for that but these were my one item a month purchase for March and I am very very happy with them and I'm very excited that I have now filmed this video and can actually get on with wearing them because they've been sat in my room for about two weeks i hope you have enjoyed this video let me know if it was helpful what is your favorite brand of trainer i genuinely be interested to know because I think I may be just an Adidas girl now i think this this may be it but then I said that about Converse so we shall have to see subscribe to my channel if you are not already and would like to see more from me and I will see you guys very very soon bye",2025-06-23 14:57:46.311212 UTC

TTwSDrAzOZw,on cloudmonster 2,hey everyone Matt here from Doc running and today we're going to do a full review of the on cloud monster 2 so this is On's higher cushioned daily training shoe the last version W really really did well and was kind of one of the first shoes that we on dror running was felt like was an actually cushioned on shoe now to be fair it's still a little on the firmer end and there is now a more cushion version called the oncloud Eclipse which it will have a video comparison to that fairly soon but this is version two and there's a lot of changes that still keep the essence of this shoe well really finessing a couple things and making something else a little bit different so let's talk about that stuff first talk about specs there is a higher stack height in this version now it's 35 mm in the heel 29 in the 4ot for a 6 mm drop that's up a couple millimet from the previous version it is still fairly cushion but fairly on the on the firmer end for how much foam there is there it's not Bare Bones but there's a lot more resiliency than compliance meaning the sole does bounce but it's not super soft it's just got good protective cushioning while still being a little bit on the firmer end there are two different densities of midsole here I believe it's both helon foam the 4ot foam now has a slightly softer feel the heel is slightly firmer and what that does is it makes the heel not bottom out as somebody who's a heel striker in the first version when I landed it felt like this was a negative drop shoe and I actually had some Achilles issues in version one I still liked it but it was just kind of difficult for me to run kind more mileage in when I wasn't really prepping my killes this version the way they've set that up really solves that where it's still this really nice rocker ride but it's more balanced now so it doesn't feel like the heel gives way when you land it transition you nicely forward and then you've got the softer foam which compresses a little bit more which kind of evens it out instead of the heel bottoming it out so really really nice on that roundout of regard uh despite there not being a massive bevel on this shoe it still has a really solid heel transition and I think that's cuz the clouds are actually doing a great job of compressing now again not a super soft ride but one that's definitely a little bit responsive that I was really really surprised out the forfoot though this Sho is a teeny bit stiff not the stiff it's but there is a speedboard in here that's Now hidden as they fill this in which actually it adds some rigidity to the soil and makes it inherently more stable to be honest with you um compared to the last version I felt like separated a little bit but back to for foot flexibility it's on the stiffer side and there's a good rocker that transitions you forward really nicely not too much tow spring here just a little bit so people that want their foot in a relatively neutral position their toes you should be fine here but the ride is actually fairly nice and responsive despite the fact the weight has gone up so men's size 9 is now coming in at 10.4 o women's side a is coming in at8 .1 o so it's a little bit heavier than the last version but I actually didn't have a problem with that cuz the foam is actually really the especially the the clouds are actually really nice and responsive with her I actually ran a 539 stroller Mile and the last Last Mile of of a 14 mile long R it actually did really really well is this a racing shoe no that's not how it's intended but it can still move if you push it so the weight I'm not as worried about based on the fact it is a fairly responsive Soul if that's something that you want which is really really great the upper where things really change the last version felt very normal maybe slightly wider this version is wide and much higher volume which is great because there's plenty of room if you have a wider or a higher volume foot this might work really really well the only challenge to that for my foot which is kind of more normal volume I really had to lock the laces down and unfortunately the tongue is extremely thin so I started irritating the dors of my foot or the top of my foot and some of you may have felt this before all of a sudden the top of your foot starts to really really hurt and it's kind of achy and sometimes that can happen because you've tied the lace is too tight and you're really compressing all your extent toe extensor tendons so that's what I got because I was just trying to lock the shoe down and unfortunately there's not enough protection here so if you're going to wear this shoe I would suggest either a if you have a higher volume foot you should be okay or B you're going to need to wear some thicker socks to take up some of the volume as well as provide some protection for you there are some very interesting ways to to modify this there's something there's variations of lacing techniques where you can actually instead of Crossing it can actually just come straight across and go up like this I have to share a video but look at lard lacing there's other forms of lacing you can use to take some pressure off your foot in that way but overall I think this shoe is is great I like it better than the previous version especially the way the soul is set up so I don't feel my achilles getting loaded as much but it's still in that same Regard in terms of a training shoe that can pick up the pace that's classic to on that's just a little bit more firm and responsive so that's something you're looking for that's great if you want something a little bit more relaxed the on cloud eclipse is probably a better option for you but a classic on style it's also a little bit firm hope this video helped you decide whether this shoe is right for you or not we'll have more soon so check back in with us,2025-06-23 14:41:10.127442 UTC
rt0NS-Zrw9I,on cloudmonster 2,hey everyone Matt here from dox running and today we're going to do a comparison review of the oncloud monster 2 and the oncloud eclipse so the reason for this comparison review is that these shoes on paper are actually quite similar in terms of both having helon Foams both having somewhat similar stack Heights and certainly similar weights I hope with this is to help you kind of figure out which one might work better for you if you're even interested in these shoes at all so the both shoes we have separate reviews on but let's compare them and see how things go so spec-wise first in my size 10 my the oncloud monster 2 is coming in at 304 G or about 10.7 Oz the oncloud eclipse is coming in at 298 G or about 10.5 Oz the stack height for the oncloud monster 2 is 36 in the heel 29 in the 4ot for a 6 mm drop the oncloud clips is coming in a little bit higher at 40 mm in the heel 35 in the 4 fo for a 5mm drop so outside of that in terms of function this is where these two really really start to separate so the oncloud monster 2 in my mind is kind of more like your normal daily training shoe it's kind of in that midweight range it's like in classic on slightly firmer but it's a little bit more responsive meaning it can do easy Paces but it can also go into a little bit faster Paces the encl eclipse is a very different shoe in that yes there's more foam underfoot but it feels much more comfortable going at easy Paces The Rocker is much more noticeable in the oncloud eclipse it also responds much better at slower Paces trying to pick up the pace this thing's just a little bit large and the foam does and the setup doesn't respond the same way so fast Paces don't feel as good but easy runs walking slow recovery jogs feel really really good the on the cloud Clips because I think that's the angle that you're going to compress both the cloud Tech as well as get that rocker to really really go the oncloud Monster again is going to be different where the cloud setup and the way the shoe is it's not nearly as rocker but it's a little bit more Snappy it tends to bounce a little bit more there's just a teeny bit more flexibility to the sole so if you want to move a little quicker and do daily Paces the oncloud monster 2 is going to be a little bit better now ironically despite this being the faster shoot it is actually the one to me that feels a little bit more stable so midfoot and the way the things are designed again I know the oncloud monster the out Cloud Eclipse I'm sorry it technically has what looks like a little bit more width but the way the soul is set up the oncloud monster 2 just works a little bit better so the sidewalls are a little bit better in the oncloud monster too um and it just the way the snappy just tends to push you forward fairly quickly the oncloud eclipse again because there's so much cut out of the midfoot when I run in this shoe and if I Collapse at all immediately I don't really have a lot so yes there is a sidewall here but I just feel like this shoe doesn't have the same medial guidance that the oncloud monster 2 does if you need lateral it's totally fine because of the curve setup and there is a fairly decent lateral sidewall but for stability needs or some guidance the oncloud monster 2o is going to be a little better but neither of them are true stability shoes to be honest with you the major difference here is where we start getting into the upper so both them have actually really comfortable fits the oncloud eclipse has the more comfortable fit because the upper is a little bit lighter um it's definitely more breathable and there's quite a bit more stretch to it the cloud monster 2 has a lot of volume that's something that we noticed in our review and the video review there's just a lot more room in this shoe and that's good for certain people that have higher volume feet the only challenge is that when I try to lock the laces down the tongue is really really thin in the oncloud monster too in the oncloud eclipse the tongue is thin but it is still padded so I can tighten down the laces and it didn't bother the top of my foot the oncloud monster 2 did so if you need more volume the oncloud monster 2 is probably going to be the best option if you need normal to just a little bit wider the encl is probably going to be your best bet just because you can see the 4 foot is a little bit wider in the cloud monster 2o but the 4 foot stretches a little bit more with being a normal fit in the oncloud eclipse so that's kind of the big difference there heel counters and the heel fit fairly similar and that but there is a little bit more flexibility in the oncloud clip so if you're a little sensitive to counters this may be a better option but they're fairly similar and Isabella also thinks so too as she's falling asleep but those are really the big differences between the shoe I like there's a little bit more versatility and speed with the

xie-qC7HDc4,Veja Esplar,hey everyone hope y'all are having a great day and i just wanted to give you all a quick on feet review of a pair of shoes that i recently got from a company that i haven't ever shopped from before this is an interesting brand based in france from paris actually and the ethos of this brand is all about sustainability recycling you know zero waste and um it's something that i think a lot of brands are really trying to take seriously and i like it because it's an independent brand you know it's not adidas nike puma you know big brands like that and so it's always nice to support smaller brands that are trying to do something big and so you can see the symbol of the brand it's kind of like a v symbol on the lateral and medial side and the name of the brand is on the back of this shoe it's called vasia v e j a so parisian brand around i think for a few years now and something that i've wanted to try out for a while and initial impressions of these shoes these are the esplars esp lars they run for around 120. you know my initial impression on these is that you can tell that they are reused and recycled materials because you know the quality of the leather is stiff i've worn these a few times now so you know you can see the way it creases it's stiff leather the shoes are i would say they're comfortable they're more comfortable than traditional chuck taylor but they're not as comfortable as say you know adidas stan smith's or something those are a lot more cushiony you know the rubber is more cushioned but i really like them i mean they look good they look extremely clean and they are something that not everybody is wearing and it's getting just harder and harder to find shoes like that that not every you know everybody's got yeezys everybody you know all the jordans um you know i wear a lot of adidas but people are really kind of getting into those old school adidas again so this is another option for people um i would recommend them i think they're very comfortable sizing is something if you look online that's tough on these and so i kind of size down half a size so if you look at the silhouette of the shoe it's kind of like a narrow long shoe you know kind of similar silhouette to say a um you know a stan smith from adidas or their continental shoes or their campus shoes kind of like the same low top silhouette and so i usually wear a size 12 in those i bought an 11 and a half in these and you know they fit perfectly so i would recommend going true to size or half a size down depending upon how you like the fit um the interior of the shoe is very roomy so you're not going to have a lot of toe problems and i like them even though they're hard um like you know the the rubber is hard the leather is hard i find them comfortable and i can wear for you know five six hours at a time without issues one thing with this particular version the esplar you can notice it's all this leather material but there's no ventilation so these do kind of get hot a little bit i mean i think they're awesome fall winter shoes but i don't know how good these would be in the summer there's a lot of different kinds of vegas shoes they have more traditional sneaker styles but i think from what i've seen like this silhouette is kind of like their classic or iconic silhouette and so that's where i want to start anyway these run for around 120 they're available at places like nordstrom and a bunch of other retailers so i mean definitely check them out you can find them on sale i got these for 70 bucks and i thought that was just a killer deal on them and so um i would i would definitely recommend these i'm surprised at how much i like them i would choose these over some stan smiths i would definitely choose choose these over like nike blazers or anything i think there's a much more interesting shoe anyway sorry as always i'm rambling i hope you enjoyed this quick on feet review of these really cool shoes these are the vezia esplars shoe anyway take care guys god bless have a good day,2025-06-23 14:57:44.416044 UTC
0ex_pCZw6HA,Adidas Gazelle,hey everyone it's Jen I hope you're doing well this video is a quick review and on foot of the Adidas gazelle indoor which is a slight variation of the Adidas gazelle Adidas retro this style because of the Gucci collab that recently dropped the price is crazy on those but that green colorway is nice this blue colorway is one of three that released in a pack and retailed for a whopping 150 I bought these during Adidas's 30 off sale which I recommend you do if you're looking to buy a pair gazelles also always go on sale either on Adidas's site or at retailers so research and patients are key this style is pretty straightforward and simple which is why I like the gazelle so much it's easy to style and I usually throw them on when I'm running errands so they get a ton of wear the blue suede really pops over the gum sole the suede is on the hairier side but is nice and soft the tongue is a thin felt material that's used on the regular gazelle and Samba and the ankle is lined with soft leather a few key differences between the gazelle indoor and regular gazelle is the toe box overlay there's more of a tea design on the indoor they also have different Souls the insole has a thin piece of leather on top of the foam usually the top layer is a super thin textile but they added a little something extra on the indoor insole this pair and the other two in the indoor pack come with an extra set of white laces which I think look better and give the upper a nice contrast I did also get the black pair on sale and I noticed the upper is more of a new book compared to the hairy suede on the blue pair so a minor detail if you're trying to figure out which one you want to buy sizing wise these fit like a typical gazelle I have narrow feet one a half size down in my men's size and they fit perfect for reference I go true to size and the Jordan 1 3 4 and most Air Max styles that wraps up the video let me know your thoughts on this retro Adidas style and thanks for watching foreign foreign,2025-06-23 14:38:59.350894 UTC

y6ba6OG9pXQ,Veja Esplar,hey everyone welcome back to my channel i hope you're all doing really well today's video is going to be a dedicated video to evasion trainers so i'm sure most of you probably have heard of vega trainers before they're basically a sustainable vegan leather trainer brand they've been around for a few years and they have really really just grown and gained so much popularity over the years my current evasion trainers collection consists of two pairs pair number one being the vasia s blood trainers i've had these for three or four years maybe over four years honestly a really long time these have been in my wardrobe for so long part of my trainer collection for a really long time so i feel like i can give you a really good review on these and same goes for pair number two these are the evasion v10 trainers these are slightly more recent edition within my shoedrobe i've had them for about seven months so still a substantial amount of time i think i can give you an in-depth review on both trainers so that's my plan for today's video my plan for this video is to start off with a mini review of both pairs of trainers i'll start off with the s blur and then i'll move on to the vaser v10 and from there i'll do a comparison between the two pairs as well if these two are on your wish list and you want to know a little bit more about both pairs then hopefully this video will answer all of your questions if there is anything that i miss out or i forget to mention or anything extra that you want to know that maybe you're interested in finding out then please just leave me a comment down below and i will get back to you so let's start off with the vajra s blood trainers first up i'll review the evasia s blood trainers purely because i've had these for the longer period of time so this is them i have the all white vegan leather version and i admittedly these weren't actually the ones i had wanted at the time this was the first pair of visa trainers that i introduced into my collection and i know that on my wish list i actually had the esbr trainers with the black detailing so this little v design detail that they have on most of their trainers was actually black and i believe that then this back section was also black however they didn't have those for some reason either they didn't have my size or they just didn't have that in stock at the time and i ended up going for the all-white version and in hindsight i'm so happy that i did honestly these have just been so good i've worn them so much i wear them all the time still like they're just never out of style in my opinion i honestly think i'll wear these forever they're just so good i've had these for about three or four years and honestly they're still in really tip-top shape they actually are still looking really good they've obviously got signs of wear which is just natural with a pair of trainers when you've had them for such a long period of time but they're still looking pretty good these have a suede section at the back where they have the branding which yes it's definitely like rubbing it probably doesn't look as good and as fresh as it did when i first got these but that's as expected with a general wear they haven't rubbed at all like they're not losing any sort of fabric inside or anything like that they're still in really good condition the soles haven't unstuck or anything like that they're just still doing really good i still get a lot of wear out of them and i'm sure that i will continue to do so as you can tell these are all white but the rubber section of the bottom is more of a cream slash beige tone this is actually quite common in a lot of visual trainers and initially this was something i wasn't quite sure of i did actually think i don't know if i like the fact that it isn't completely crisp white but i love it and actually isn't something that bothers me at all when i wear these and i also think it matches quite nicely with the back section as well this little suede section they kind of match a little bit i mean it's not a big deal but it's something that at first i thought could potentially be a deal breaker and actually be quite annoying when trying to style these but honestly had absolutely no issues with that whatsoever it's just got standard white laces the leather tongue that these trainers have are absolutely perfect they're actually in really good condition still they honestly almost look unwarm these have like a few scuffs and so on but nothing that's unexpected with this amount of wear they also don't have a lot of folding or anything as sometimes tends to happen with leather as they fold more regularly in certain places you can get some leather creasing but honestly there are a few bits of creasing just on this side here but again nothing substantial nothing that you're going to notice unless you're literally this close to a pair of trainers which i don't think typically you're not i mean i'm filming a video and obviously i have to have them quite close for me to share them with you but generally speaking i don't carry or hold my trainers this close to my face on a general day-to-day so that's just something i thought i would mention but isn't necessarily something that is a deal breaker or anything like that the soles of these are still also in really great condition these are kind of like a pebble design i don't find they slip or anything like that i actually find they're really good in terms of grip they're really quite good and i find them really comfortable also in terms of this tongue it's quite structured i really don't know how else to describe that other than saying it's structured but basically it's just a little bit thick and here you can actually see that there has been a little bit of wear and this is actually something that initially when i first got these it bothered me a little bit because it can start to rub a little bit on that kind of dip in your foot and that is something i noticed initially when i got these and it was something that i was like oh gosh i hope this gets better but it definitely does now they're definitely a bit more malleable a bit more flexible and actually it's kind of i mean you won't be able to see but it's kind of a little bit worn on this upper section here which i think is just from general rubbing on my foot but honestly something that doesn't bother me anymore it doesn't hurt and it never cut me or anything like that it was never anything drastic but it's definitely something i noticed with these i don't typically notice with other types of trainers and i just think it's purely down to the fact that it is so structured and it kind of stays in place i think that's the thing with this particular pair of esplar trainers if they're very structured they're so comfortable to wear so comfortable to walk around in i honestly do days in this i travel wearing these i just think they're a really really great pair of trainers to have they're classic but still quite dressed up and that's what i would always say about veishea trainers generally speaking that's an attribute that i really really do rate about the veishea trainers because i just think that they're a brand that does trainers but in a really elegant way i often choose these when i'm going for a smart casual look and i'm not quite sure what shoes to wear i want something that will be comfortable yet still look elegant and still look stylish basically a smart casual option and i think these are so great for that they look fantastic paired with trousers which is how i often wear them whether it be jeans or more form-fitting trousers like tailored trousers for example i think these look great these look great in the summer paired with dresses i love wearing these with midi dresses with mini dresses as well i just think they look so good with everything and that's another reason why i absolutely love this particular colorway because i think it's so easy to style with a multitude of different outfits they're not too colorful they're not too in your face they're just such a good trainer option to have in your collection and honestly i love these in terms of sizing i have my usual size in this i think that they are true to size i have actually seen varying reviews in terms of a sizing of the vaser trainers and that was actually something that initially i was a bit hesitant about going for veda trainers i ordered these online and i really really worried about sizing but in the end i decided to go for my usual size because i tend to be quite true to size i don't really vary footwear sizing much so that's the reason why i decided to go for my usual size and it's great they fit so well they're not too big they're not too small they're literally they're the perfect fit they're true to size so i would recommend going for your usual size unless you're a half size now this is where i think there are slight issues when it comes to vader trainers because i'm pretty certain that vagina don't do half sizes so if you happen to be a half size i would size up rather than sizing down because i've heard from other people who have these kind of trainers that you're better off sizing up rather than sizing down so for example if you are a five and a half you're better off sizing up to a size six rather than sizing down to a size five because they may just be a little bit too snug but that's just something to bear in mind obviously i didn't have that issue myself i'm not half size and i got my usual size and these fits absolutely perfect but it's something i wanted to mention in case that is something that is putting you off these or maybe something that you're slightly worried about i would recommend sizing up if you're a half size and i think that's pretty much my review of the vajra eslar trainers honestly they last amazingly well i think looking at them hopefully you can see that they are in really really great condition considering how much i wear them which trust me is a lot and if you follow me on instagram or even if you've watched any of my previous videos then you'll know how much i wear and style these they really are an integral part within my wardrobe these come in so many different colors as well and i will say that i do think the black version so with the black v and the black section here at the back is high up on my wish list i think it'll be a really nice addition to have but for now if you're unsure if you want something that will go for absolutely everything then i definitely think the vajra s blah or white are a really fantastic option on to my second pair now these are the vajra v10 trainers and i think compared to the others you can see there is a huge difference between them already these in my opinion definitely have more of a traditional chunky trainer vibe to them this pair has more color than the previous pair that i showed you so they are obviously an all white vegan leather then the v detail here is a navy leather it looks black but it's navy and then here at the back we have a pop of red i really love this honestly it's actually just so bright and colorful and i really like that so these are the v10 trainers they look completely different to the s blood trainers i'm sure you can tell these are definitely more of a traditional chunky masculine style of trainer so on the front they have these kind of like air pocket bubbles at the front which i think is very reminiscent of masculine trainers and then the sole of these is much thicker it's the same color though it's that cream colorway same as the esplanade trainers but this i think you can tell so much chunkier just in general this is definitely a chunkier trainer and i actually got these in the wintertime because i felt like these would be a really great option for the winter i like the fact that they are chunkier i like the fact that they had a little bit of color there as well just very subtle pops of color but still pops of color which i think are really nice in the winter time although i would still wear these summer time i'm just saying that i picked these up in the winter time and i think those are the things that drew me to this particular pair the back here is higher than on the espla trainers so once again a bit more of a chunkier classic trainer feel it's also very padded and cushioned so they're really comfortable the sole is so much thicker and it goes up slightly on the back so it's not as flat as the s blah trainers are these definitely have a bit more height there to them the laces are all white and then when it comes to the tongue on these trainers it's completely different to the vajra esplas style so this just feels way more malleable and just way more flimsy as well it's really easy to move this and it's not incredibly structured like it won't stay in place as much as the esblar one does and that's just something to bear in mind with that said i think it may actually be a good thing because i had absolutely no issues with this tongue at all i think because it is a bit more malleable and it has a bit more movement there it doesn't tend to rub and stay in the same spot so i haven't had absolutely any issues with these in terms of breaking them in or wearing them for prolonged periods of times or anything like that i really haven't had any issues with these whatsoever i went ahead and did the exact same thing in terms of sizing i went for my usual size and i have found them to be very true to size they fit incredibly well they're really comfortable they just give off a completely different vibe to the espla trainers they're definitely more of a classic style more of a classic trainer quite chunky a little bit more masculine as well so great to wear with jeans i think these are great for jeans in my opinion and i just think that super comfortable i've had these for about seven months and i think enough time for me to judge how comfortable they are and trust me they are very comfortable in terms of signs of wear these ones the leather of these ones is actually i think it's slightly less structured it's a bit more flimsy because with these i can see that there is a slight line here on the leather which is just as my foot bends as i walk so there is a slight bend here in the leather it's nothing crazy noticeable and funnily enough it's only in this upper section here which is made of a thinner leather compared to the outer section the outer section has a thicker leather similar to the visual espla trainers but this front bit is a much more thin malleable style leather the same sort of style as the tongue so just much more malleable and a bit easier to bend and fold and for that reason there is a little bend in the leather here which is obviously from where from walking your foot naturally bends so of course your trainers do too but there is a bit of a noticeable mark here nothing drastic nothing crazy i do actually think it's very well concealed by the detailing in this section here you actually can't tell it's once again something that i can only tell because i am literally holding my trainers this close to my face so naturally it's something that when you're out and about when you're walking when these are on your feet where they should be you're not going to see that at all and in terms of everywhere else literally no folds anywhere else on my s blah trainers i had some slight bending or like bends in the leather here but so far on these nothing that's coming through i do think as the years go by and with general aware that they will start to show a little bit but nothing drastic i do genuinely think that the leather is just so good on these it's really great quality vegan leather so a sustainable option but still the quality is still there the longevity is still there as well as proven with my first pair that then enticed me to buy a second pair of asia trainers because i do just really really like the brand oh and i almost forgot to show you the soul of the trainers as well so these are more of a trainer style so oh my gosh that sounds so silly obviously i'm not professional when it comes to describing trainers just i'm sure you've gathered by now but the soul of these it actually says they're made with wild rubber from amazonia and this one has a few more details it's actually got these pressure points here where your foot meets the ground in particular sections i don't know if that's just a design feature or if it actually does something but i thought i would mention that anyway so yeah these are the v10 trainers i've had these for about seven months and also really incredibly happy with these as well to finish off the video i promised you a comparison between the two pairs so my vajra s blood trainers and then my vajra v10 trainers so i think the first thing that we notice is obviously just the style the general style of these clearly the vajra v10 trainers are more of a typical style of trainer still quite casual and able to be worn dressed down and more casual vibes but definitely more of a classic trainer style whereas with the vajra s blood trainers you can see that there isn't as much of a typical trainer chunky trainer structure there it's definitely more of a flat trainer more of a casual you know one that you're not going to go running in you know you might go running in these i don't think you'd go running in these so that is the first noticeable difference between the two of them the second is of course the leather and the detailing on the leather these ones are pretty much plain they're also very structured leather as well as i mentioned whilst reviewing them the leather feels much less malleable compared to the v10 trainers where there is a little bit of movement there particularly on the front of these and also the back goes up a little bit more compared to the visual trainers i think you can see like this as i hold them up that the backs are completely different as well as the fronts they just look so different and next up the rubber soles they are obviously quite different the vajra espla trainers are quite a flat sole it's a very flat shoe but when it comes to the veij v10 trainers there's more height there generally speaking i think that makes them a bit more comfortable to wear just a bit more natural in terms of your foot if you have any issues like any foot concerns then sometimes flat trainers can actually lead to some problems i personally don't find any issues with them but just something that i thought i would bear in mind laces exactly the same the tongue on both of these is different i mentioned on the v10 it's more flimsy a bit more malleable a bit more movement there whereas on the s blood trainers the tongue is quite structured and can lead to a little bit of rubbing so it's just something to bear in mind with the two of these that this one is just generally more structured leather and this one slightly more malleable and i think it comes with the styles the v10 being a slightly more how should i say maybe fitness related or maybe not fitness but a bit more trainer style whereas the espla trainers are definitely more of a stylish trainer probably mostly to be worn as a casual trainer during the day rather than anything particularly sporty so that's my thought on the both of these if there's anything that i have maybe missed out or anything else that you are interested that i've forgotten to mention or i just haven't mentioned then please leave me a comment and i will get back to you of course and um yeah i hope you found today's video interesting and insightful i hope it answered some of

hCjG3Yz5SPQ,ASICS GEL-LYTE III,hey guys how's it going sneaker madness here and today I've got a big pick up for you guys today this is the one I said that you'd probably really really like this is a shoe I've been after for ages that well I say AJ's quite a few well about a year now finally got it walnut quite a lot since which I'm starting to right now but anyway I needed to wear it because it's just art one of my favorite releases of last last year yeah one of my favorite releases of last year and one of my favorite Asics of all the time I think so it's an a6 and that normal a six box so I got this off a website called collect I feel for now to collect so anyway it's called collect dots in up at lincoln description is basically like a massive site where sneaky community guykage littering is that they wanna sell and it's from pretty much all over the world so you got people from the states all over europe listen trainers that they they're selling and stuff so you contact them you paid by paypal blunted by bar something this up from a guide across or you get speaking to a pretty nice chap I've got quite a few kicks on that it's from Holland so yeah email them for a while you know the usual legit checks make sure the shoes okay in the condition that wanted so these are the Asics Joe right freeze and olive Burch colorway in the USA and a half sale to show you guys yeah probably know what they are now Java free st. Alfred's nicknamed Lake chores say yeah this is the olive umber colorway and there's UK seven-and-a-half if there are guys so as I said I have worn these about three or four times as soon as got them it's not being great over here either I just wanted to worry because I just needed to buy them yeah so I'll make these with the beige laces personally there I glued further places some probably gonna swap they swap again soon anyway so this shoe is probably one of my favorite gel-like furries of all time I just think it's a simple and clean and it's literally executed to perfection I am trying to get hold of a dead stock pair though cuz I just feel too bad for in these or the song because such beautiful show in my opinion so yeah so the shoe itself is a collaboration between Asics and st. Alfred and st. Alfred is chicago-based retailer and the shoe itself is nicknamed lake shores because it's it's inspired by the Chicago lakefront with a combination there's like these these are cool blues on the upper and then you've got my kind of like sandy beige on the on the bottom so that's pretty cool concept there see yes Saint Alfred do a lot of sneaker collaborations and stuff so there can't be free laces I'll show you that first first for you at this beige laces with that blue tip and then we've got three vases which personally in my favor and then you forgot the wine laces which I haven't tried in the tree yet so can't be good to give them a go see see how the chute is super super clean they've retailed at 119 pounds written exclusive really hard to get they actually got released June last year in 2013 so so yeah miss out on them on retail ever since I've been trying to get a pair prices I thought we're gonna drop it they didn't let just one up ended up buying this pair for I think they're warm one ended up buying them for like two hundred and thirty pounds which I know you guys is a lot of money to drop on more pair of sneakers but for me they are worth it they are one of my favorite sneakers of any time I've got to put out there they are they're just so simple and the way that executed this is brilliant and my eyes materials color way everything about this is this perfect more eyelet I would look for in a gel right free um so yeah drop to 30 on them I'm not I'm not saying that to try and show off that much of God just basically telling you guys how much I'm gonna try value this sneaker that's how much I was willing to pay for them I did sell a pair of trainers to help fund them so it wasn't like it was a stray cash I did get a bit funding from selling a pair of trainers that I no longer wear anymore I do like to wear my cake say so yeah if I'm not gonna wear a pair of trainers over either by Pat I've been after for ages that I feel comfortable wearing and I would happily rock so I went ahead and did that so the shoes themselves as I said is inspired like to make sure the lakefront sorry so yeah let's start from the bottom you got this gum midsole sort of guys should clean up but this gum gum outsole sorry it's dark I'm at the top that a seat from dinner and then at the bottom you've got more of a translation translucent done I see you tell the difference to come up on the midsole and then on this mid so you gots a nice base she's adding tell her it's got my they actually come bring yourself by the way guys often they actually cut in like we're looking a bit worn but really spongy soft material basics brand in there and then you can't got this you at the softness here again running up this bit here on the back feel that plastic support running around the back and again in that beige color looks really nice especially against ISA these different types of Blues you got like that darkness kind of suede at the back with that a cigs and Joanne Ostler Joel I free again and boss in the side that dark blue just sits there and back really nice then got that hit of a soft suede for the lighter kind of blue gray material that runs around the whole entire shoe so from front or upper you've got that one whole same color we have got this really nice as this conveyor boss branding it's this all one material these stripes usually slice layered up and stuff but I like how they've just done as one whole material one own underneath really cool underneath that you've got this underlay of perforated suede really nice perforated then on the toe box this is really nice way guys if you can see it's a slight change in color when I switch it from side to side totally my swag got detailed in hexa free and that there are now again on this side you got that nice suede exactly the same and a perforated underlay you think got these nice detailed stitching they've really shot in the in the camera as well the stitching guys when they're taking pictures and stuff which which I really like about the shoe you then got that split something they see almost job like for it well every July free and then you've got the laces or these dot plastic and then guys like lace lacing weather Lacey's go for pass pass for you but this uh plastic dark blue detailing that and again on the other side on the inside of the shoe so guys this looks a bit warm probably sweat and stuff I personally know people wash but a nice soft leather Misaka off-white material inside there you then got this why Asics insole again and never it's a really nice hunt like a a memory foam material stitched in as well with choices high-quality so yeah this pair of shoes is probably as I said my favorite y'all are free to edible release I'm happy I managed to finally pick these up I don't think I've ever ever let these though I'm probably not gonna wear them as much in the winter though because I don't want to ruin them I'd rather save them for summer

XJkAvkLMhxY,Vans Old Skool,hey guys obvious back here back again with another vans video and today we are looking at the skate old school colorway is black white size 13 and retail on these was 70 so today i want to go over the brand new skateboarding classics line which we'll be launching officially as of march 4th but you might start to see these trickle into your local either van store skate shop but i believe online is going to be the hard launch on the march 4th so keep your eye out for these so starting off with the box here obviously you guys can see that we have something totally different this is going to be the box going forward for any kind of pro skate skate classic type shoe on the top of the box here we do have a little faded graphic of the shoe that we will be covering today of course you got the checkerboard flag on the side which we will also be seeing moving forward skateboarding branding throughout the box checkerboard patterns got checkered tissue paper in there so here i picked up just your basic black and white old school the first the initial launch of these you're going to see all of the classic colorways black white old school black white skate high black white slip-on black white authentic black white half cab black black calf cab black black old school skate high slip-on authentic there's also a classic white color that's coming across the board and pretty much all those silhouettes excluding the half cab and a navy as well all the silhouettes excluding the half cab and then from there on out i'm sure that any new colorways that come out for any you know what was pro skate shoe will now be under the skateboarding classics line so um as far as why vance is doing this uh one of the big parts so one of the big pushes on this is to make the shoe more inclusive so by branding them as a pro shoe you know amateurs that might pick these up you know they might even think like hey this is not for me you know what i mean it's it's too good it's for the professionals only so um and rebranding it as skateboarding classics it's kind of you know open to to everybody at this point whether you're pro amateur um also kind of making it a little more user friendly for the customer that's shopping around and doesn't know you know like why this one is different than the classics right so if they pick up the shoe they'll see the skateboarding on the heel and note immediately like okay like this is the skate version also giving it the name skate old school um you know it kind of puts it in your face that it's a skate shoe so that was definitely one of the big reasons behind it but also i think they just needed a change for the pro skate line so you will no longer see it as pro skate if you're looking on the website or anywhere else it will from here on out be either skateboarding classics or skate classics so even with the box and the name here where it says skate old school every single style that comes out with this will be skate and then whatever the style is so to compare and contrast with the new and the old here i have my sci-fi fantasy old school pros that i will be using to show you guys the differences there's not really too much that's different about the shoes mostly just aesthetics but we will definitely take a look at that so first and foremost as i mentioned you on the box here the checkerboard flag on the side this is definitely a lot different and it stands out immediately to me i'm so used to seeing that red flag for the old school pro so it will always have a checkered flag on the side of it you do have the vans hit on the bottom too which is pretty cool um but yeah any shoe that comes out through pro skate will have this little flag somewhere on it so the skate sports that i just did the review on had it on the heel here i've seen it in all different places with these new ones um but i do like that it's not like the vans logo right in your face i always love the subtle ones as far as like the actual uppers of the shoe here exactly the same you got your suede and your canvas combination that we've seen a million times over and the suede like quality is is nothing fantastic you know as far as just being a gr it's you can kind of see it too it looks a little rough there but um you know it's meant to be a skate shoe so having that top-notch weight isn't really going to make too big a difference we do see these newer midsoles which you can see are shiny so this i feel like is gonna be a big uh part of the change i don't know if people are gonna be on board with this some will some won't i personally love it i think it's rad um you know i always love the the anaheim factory versions and you know it's just kind of like a nod to the the retro styles and you will see this on every single shoot this like shiny soul so even if it's a gum sole if it's a black sole any colored sole whatsoever will have the shiny gloss on it still do see the duracap technology the duracap technology is is underlays of rubber to add to the durability of the shoe so we do see it around the toe bumper here it's a little bit thicker than what you normally see also underneath the toe box there's actually like a big piece of rubber that's under here that will help uh to just add another layer if you guys are skating through these so that remains the same they just put it in a different spot now for the logo so you can see before it was actually on the toe bumper now it's just on the side here the skateboarding heel tab of course you know rebranding it versus the the old pro ones here i think that's pretty cool so it's the same thing where it kind of pops out a little bit too on the actual outsole of the shoe this features a new rubber compound that they are calling six stick and it's basically going to be deeper than the tread that you would normally have on the pro i was comparing these side by side and it's it's pretty minimal like it is a little bit deeper on these new ones but like you probably can't even tell in this video to be honest with you but it is a little bit deeper for the new ones it is also going to be a grippier rubber so these this technology is already available on the roan pro and i believe that's the only vans pro shoe that actually has that type of rubber right now but um yeah so it's supposed to add to that grip and the durability of the shoe of course we still see our standard premium cotton laces here and the white and they do come with extra laces too so we got the black on there we no longer have a pro eyelet so if you look on the top there you can see it's just still a metal eyelet but it's just pretty bare versus having the actual pro hit on it under the tongue of the shoe we see world's number one skateboarding shoe with the checkered logo on this one and this older one um just basically replacing the pro there with the checkered on the actual interior of the shoe we do still see the pop kush insoles which we have seen before this is not a new technology for vans except it's just it looks a little different as all so you can tell on the bottom here just a different tread um and then being a little more obvious that it's a pop-push insole so the benefit of the pop kush insole is supposed to be that it it won't flatten on you so it'll take the impact and then like regain its shape if you guys are taking these you know to the extreme and i mean actually just feeling the insoles themselves they yeah they totally feel like exactly the same so i i don't think there is any difference in this pop kush versus you know the older pop kush but you know i could be wrong um underneath the tongue here we do see straps so this is also a new feature that we did not see with the regular pro classes and as you can tell desperately needed it with these the tongue is just like totally crooked on this which is always a bummer especially with skate highs it's the worst so having the straps here to lock down that tongue super helpful you will see this on every single model on the actual lining of the collar here we do have a vinyl a white vinyl material that lines the collar so that will also hopefully add to the durability of the inside here won't get torn up uh but other than that i believe that's it there's like i said there's really not too much difference the main things are gonna be the gloss on the side here the deeper tread um the locked in tongue with the straps and then the the heel on the inside here i mean it's gonna look different you'll you'll see this checkerboard design on every shoe and then you got the little red trim on it but it's the same reinforced heel as the the older pro so nothing crazy there of course you got the skateboarding branding on the actual insole um the flag too i guess that's also gonna be you know a big difference but other than that yeah that's pretty much it so fit on these is exactly the same i was really trying to figure out like if there was maybe it wasn't as shallow anymore because the thick insoles and that whole thing that the pros had before but it's exactly the same price on these is 70 which i believe was what the pros were initially priced at you can if you guys go to your local van store right now all the like pro skate shoes are marked down since they're trying to get rid of them so uh i would definitely if you guys are a fan of the old ones definitely grab them now before they're gone because these will be taking over very soon well anyways hope you guys enjoyed the this review and be sure to stay tuned for the on feed you,2025-06-23 14:38:22.282800 UTC
4IP2Yj4WOds,Adidas Superstar,hey guys one here thanks for dropping by my channel and checking out this video today we're gonna be reviewing or taking a really good look at the classic adidas superstars well hey guys one here now recently I did a shoe review is my first shoe review on a different Adidas shoe well today we're going to take a good look at the adidas superstar classics the ones that have been around for many many years and we're gonna watch some very cool b-roll that gives you a good look of the shoe all the way around but first let's talk a little bit about the history of this shoe so when this shoe first come out it was the very first basketball shoe that would be the low tops and all leather all the way around and then it featured what is now famous the rubber shell toe so with the rubber top and the skid resistance traction and caught a lot of attention from some of the famous n-c-double-a and NBA players and most notably Kareem abdul-jabbar and then over the course of a few years it would transition from the courts to the streets where then it would gain so much popularity through a rap band called Run DMC now growing up as a kid I remember some of the rap fans I would wear them and I remember Run DMC specifically wearing their these superstars I thought how cool they were because they had the three black stripes you know and the big white shoes and they would wear like black jeans and they were wear black you know as polyester track coats and pants so the white shoes stuck out really well but as a kid I never owned them so it took quite a few years for me to finally get my first pair of Adidas superstars now my wife did buy these for me for Christmas I wanted the black stripe ones these are actually the navy blue but they still we still look pretty cool while people another native we got my hell my feet from a distance they look like and so when Run DMC would wear these they would wear them without shoe laces so some of the tongue would stick out in him so yes to each their own they were big-time fans of adidas superstar so just like the Converse Chuck Taylors the adidas superstars have become iconic and have stood the test of time and had our still a popular shoe in fashion and culture today so I when you go to the mall I mean it's nothing to see at least two or three different people wearing that these superstars now I did wear these shoes one time usually before I do a product review or show something like this I want it to be pristine and clean but I did wear these one time so I have to confess that and give you a little warning but I will tell you in the day that I wore these they were very comfortable for being an old shoe like that they were still comfortable and I got all kinds of compliments that day that I did wear them so let's take a look at some b-roll footage of the adidas superstar well thanks for watching this video guys if you liked this video go ahead and hit thumbs up on this and maybe even subscribe to this channel so I can catch you back on the next video I do reviews all the time and I do some Christian videos and I'll catch you guys in the next video but until then be creative,2025-06-23 14:43:35.637254 UTC
q2TWTBqbMHM,Converse Chuck Taylor All Star,hey guys that's right today we're going to be talking about Chuck Taylor Allstars by Converse or Chucks um you might be wondering why I'm going to be talking about such a common item however this is a piece of gear that I used while I was traveling for the last two years so I thought it merited a review and I'll throw a little history at you maybe a couple fun facts and uh my own impressions of this so hopefully you'll be entertained uh as for the design these were originally marked as just Allstars by Converse in 1917 it wasn't until later that year when a young high school player by the name of Chuck Taylor uh ended up choosing these as his favorite shoe over the next couple of years he ended up becoming their most famous salesman and he made a few suggestions to the design for example he suggested a non-slip soul and in the standard version these are the low top oxfords in the standard version he recommended a patch on the side to protect the ankle and that patch ended up having his name that's where they renamed it the Chuck Taylor All-Star since that time these have become the most successful shoe in history I mean to date I think they sold something like 750 million pairs worldwide no other shoe comes close to how popular these have been I mean seriously in popular culture where else will you find a clothing item where the Ramones Kurt Cobain from Nirvana Punky Brewster AAL LaVine Kino from the Y yes Chuck D from Public Enemy and Ferell Williams from the netes all wear the same thing I mean this has become not just a part of western culture but part of world culture as well um while I was traveling um actually I'll I'll tell you I got these in Delhi India um I've been wearing flip-flops for like a month straight and I needed a decent pair of shoes and so I walked to different stores and another thing when you're in Asia you're going to find a lot of copies I actually found a legit pair of Converse bought these for full price and ended up wearing them all over my travels I walked all over India in these uh Island hopped in Greece um I ran away from three crackheads and sicy trying to rob me that's another story for another time and when I was in Spain I ran with the bulls and pona and these guys so I mean I got a lot of sentimental value attached to this pair if I wear them out I'm probably going to just stick them in a box and keep them just for sentimental value but yeah um everywhere I've gone it's weird to be in Nepal and to see a sherpa wearing Chucks and then later that year to be in Sydney Australia in a bar and to be served by a waitress wearing Chucks I mean it's amazing how this is penetrated not just into Western culture but World culture uh you see these shoes everywhere I mean just turn on the television watch a television show or a movie and you'll see Chucks all over the place and it's with good reason I realize these are a simple design it's an old design but it works I mean they're incredibly comfortable uh granted it's a little bit heavier than a comparable modern design sneaker just because that the sole is complete Rubber and it has just a canvas top instead of some weird polymer vinyl nylon blend but they're comfortable I mean everyone I know has a pair of Chucks you put them on and you don't realize that the this is like a heavy sole I mean it just fits your foot and it's very very comfortable and um that's the cool thing this is one of those designs where men and wear women wear the same exact design and it looks fashionable on both guys wear it with jeans I've seen girls wear it with skirts looks perfectly fine um very durable I mean you just heard me like what the kind of wear like the kind of abuse I put it through the only wear issues I have here is right here when you bend it a lot the so tends to separate a little bit from the canvas upper but I mean that's not really a problem that doesn't affect functioning at all if you can see there just kind of splits on the side but that's not really a big issue it just put some Sho glue or something like that Soul after a year of hard use has worn incredibly well and it's still grippy when I'm walking around and that's another thing this is the only shoe I know that looks better when it's worn and dirty in fact I get kind of embarrassed when I wear a brand new pair of Chucks when it's like gleaming white I try to like kick something and try to get like scuffs on it cuz it just doesn't look honest without a little bit of good wear on the side of them uh these are actually a little bit too clean for my taste got to wear them in a little bit more uh fun facts let's see I already told you about the 750 million pairs but I bet you didn't know these shoes even though they were originally meant for basketball players and of course they're not popular anymore they're still popular right now with powerlifters that's right the reason for that is because the so is an even height the heel in most shoes is higher than the rest of the the soul but these are flat and powerlifters like that because they can get a good stable stance and because of that it helps them with squats and deadlifts plus because these are rubber soles they don't have as much of a cushioning as normal shoes and they feel that they can get more Force off because their force of lifting the barbell isn't absorbed by the shock in the sols of normal shoes so yeah it's weird if you turn on the Olympics you'll see a lot of powerlifters wearing Chucks that's pretty cool these come in more varieties than any other shoe you can find I mean you got these low top oxfords which I prefer you have the standard high tops I mean I've seen knee tops as well and they come in a variety of different materials instead of the standard canvas leather suede vinyl uh hemp even um you can find anything they come in different colors and designs originally these actually came out as black and just White by the way Chuck Taylor his favorite was the White Version even though black is still the most popular color but you can get them in a variety of colors and designs I mean you get different designers putting like their different marks on them different autographs on them I know so many people who actually just collect checks like different types of Chucks and when a new design comes in they're the kinds of people that wait up all night in front of a shoe store to get like a special limited edition pair I'm not really that type but I can understand it because this is such a Timeless design I know this might sound like a complete love letter and to Chucks instead of just a review but there is one thing I don't like about them and that is the price for something that is made of just canvas and rubber and for a design that's over 90 years old these things are a bit expensive um Chucks on average run about $445 at least for like a standard pair I mean that's not even counting anything special uh I think that's a little bit too expensive I blame Hollywood for the fact that you see them all over the place warn by musicians and movie stars um for something that's made of such simple materials and is probably pretty cheap to make these should be cheaper but I mean because you got such a great marketing campaign um they can charge it and you know what I'll probably pay it just because I think they're so comfy and I like wearing them so much uh also for those of you who are interested uh if you're worried about the laces uh Converse also markets uh what's called slips which are basically Chucks but without the laces and the tongue is held into the rest of the shoe by elastic so you can just slip them on like a slipper um I'll probably get a pair of those later on but yeah that's my review and my uh little spiel about uh Chuck Taylor Converse Allstars I hope you enjoyed it and uh if you don't have a pair get one uh I don't think you'll be disappointed thanks for watching guys and have a great day bye,2025-06-23 11:21:43.007083 UTC
pegU9blg1vQ,Reebok Club C 85 Vintage shoes,hey guys today I'm going to review the Reebok Club cat5 vintage in the gray color way I managed to hunt down a pair of decent size so I co-taught UK plus 65 pounds which is around so few euros at a time and these shoes are delivered in three days when you cater to Jimmy and I'm pretty excited because these are my first pair of Reeboks and because I've only worn Nikes my entire life the upper of the shoe is made of a really soft leather which is very flexible comfortable and effortless walking the letter crease is quite easily as it is very soft but I don't really mind since it's the aesthetic of the shoe on the side we have two Reebok logo in grey along with a Union Jack and on the medial side it's just plain leather panels with no wordings or logos on a heel of the shoe you do find a Reebok logo in grey there are also a lot of details on the upper such as a thin piece of fabric sewn along the heel multiple layering of letter elements and a lot of non-functional stitches that make the shoe look very defined in terms of support the base is really flat and it does not give you the high boost like you get on an arrow max plus there's a small hue contr which provides more stability on a heel as it locks your heel down to the shoe as you strike and in the toe box area we find three rows of perforations to allow ventilation the tongue is made of a really thick piece of yellow foam which is lined with fabric on the outer side and line for the resolve and microfiber line fabric inner inner side of the shoe the sights are also seams shut so that no foam is exposed on the top of the tongue we also find the Reebok Burma in gray and the classic Reebok logo in grey and red which are all embroidered onto a piece of fabric that extends all the way to the back of the tongue and are stitched together on the same spot the sock liner of the shoe is made of the same material which is found on the back of the tongue and Pat it with a yellow foam underneath it is soft and has a texture of a microfiber cloth the sock liner is relatively thick as well which Nestle's your feet really well and is very comfortable where the insole consists of two layers the upper layer is the microfiber like material which is really soft and the bottom a heart of foamy material which provides most structural support moving on to the midsole the midsole of the shoe is made of a hard foam which is lined with rubber in a darker shade of chalk you can find a rebuff Logan Mira Q and small bumps covering the whole midsole of the shoe on the medial side we have a recessed midsole near arc of the foot and you can see the two layers of foam and rubber the soles are relatively basic which consists of shallow ridges in a diamond crosshatch pattern and a circle surrounded by two concentric circles near the toe area you can also find the Reebok logo around the area where arc of the Fidesz so that's it for the review I'm really happy that I got these shoes because they are really nice I've been looking at them for a long time and they're really comfortable thank you all for watching and I'll close this review with a couple of on foot footage,2025-06-19 08:38:08.256534 UTC
AWphcGq4BVo,Stan Smith,hey guys welcome back for the channel my name is Dorian this is Ashley hello hello today we're gonna talk about whether the adidas Stan Smith's are worth it yep so so we just get into it yeah I think so this is a new series for us we've done a couple other videos about it related to white sneakers as well so if you're interested in these you might want to check out the other one we'll link it below but ash I think we just get into it let's talk about the pros of the adidas Stan Smith's like what makes them so great why are they such a big big big part of all of the shoes you recommend if you're recommending a sneaker specifically a white sneaker it's always going to be these yep tell the audience without fail tell them what because price price comparison to the quality of the shoe that designed the shoe it's just it's unbeatable it's crazy inexpensive they're like what 80 it depends yeah it could be like 70 to 80 to 90 days you can find them on sale so the put the price is super super inexpensive under 100 bucks it's a pretty clean design it's all white pretty much and then you can also the back of it this is it all white this is the triple white but you can also get it in green blue they have like a Stephen King red a bunch of different colors that you can kind of just personalize it to your personality into your sense of style but it's a really clean silhouette slim profile round toe not too bulky not too slim so ass I think it's safe to say that pound per pound dollar for dollar these are gonna be the best value you're gonna find as far as white sneakers are concerned certainly there's cheaper options out there but they're gonna have downsides and the design and comfortability and wear and tear on them so really what are the downsides of Stan Smith specifically so I would say the downsides I mean it's pretty minimal but I think it's really important to find an essential item that has the cleanest design possible so I would my wishes are that obviously the perforated holes here which represent the three stripes for Adidas were gone I wish it was just cleaner um and I mean that's really it what has the name you're not a victim yeah it was the name wasn't stamped into the rubber sole I don't necessarily mind that it's on the back of the shoe and on the tongue of the shoe it's pretty minimal but I would say those are like my two biggest things it's it could be a cleaner design and I think that that's what you should always strive for when you have when you're filling your closets up a closet up with essential item closets mini all the closet fill them all one or two whatever so I would say that's the biggest downside it could be a cleaner design so comparatively ash how do they stack up against everybody else in the white sneaker space I guess is a way to describe it I mean you have your common projects which super clean design very minimal and then these fit into the more inexpensive versions the more fast fashion and so I would say they go they can go toe to toe with any of the more inexpensive white sneakers out there these are one of my favorite ones just because it's a it's one of the cleaner designs but sometimes with your white sneakers you want a little bit of uniqueness to it so if that's what you want if you want to if you're adding additional white sneakers to your closet then that's really great but I think that for your first here I love this dance myths I think you should go with them for your first pair it feels to me a little bit like you're implying that they're cheaply made and not quality no I'm asked fashion stuff let's get real it's not gonna last it's gonna look great for a couple of weeks and then it's not gonna do well hmmm forever21 white sneakers yeah so Stan Smith leather you've got the this whole leather upper you've got the white rubber it's a really really good shoe I've had mine for you yes you've had yours for years and I've had mine for years just give him a nice clean off every now and then or taking to a tennis a sneaker shoe cleaning place they'll look pretty damn close to as good as new I've done that two and three times at least with one of my pairs and they look great so that's not to imply that they're bad for the price actually I would say the value is really high like you get close to common projects level value out of these without paying common projects level pricing which i think is extremely good and the reason why I personally love and wear these all the time as well so you were implying a little bit that these were well why don't you ask me are they worth it that is the question that I need to answer and I will say 100% without reservation without hesitation they are definitely worth it I think that regardless if you can afford more in a more expensive sneaker or not you should have this sneaker in your shoe closet at the end of the day if you really just mess them up like you really get them dirty and you just worn them and like to the point where there is no no going back they can never look like new again guess what you can easily buy another pair and it's not gonna break the bank so that's why I think that you should definitely have them regardless if they're your first pair second pair third pair fourth pair definitely have these in your closet that's it I don't know what else to say alright

cc_Vnmcsvw4,Reebok Club C 85 Vintage shoes,hey guys welcome back to a brand new video on the channel today we're going to be going over a new pair of shoes if you saw my recent shorts or one of them I was we're going to do a video on the club c85 vintage by reok so if you're not already please subscribe and like the video so let's get on to this haul to be warned I already um took the tissue paper and things out out so first let's go over the box so the box I was really hoping I was going to get that really cool box that was like had like the UK flag I think it was but this one's fun too it's just a box so it's navy blue with the reok logo on the top and then it like red in the front like that as you can see and then it splits a little bit and it goes down like that and then it's back to Blue so it's a pretty simple box there's a lot lot of different boxes I could have got but this is the one I came with this one and if you're wondering what size I got I got a 7 and A2 us it's A40 and it's it says it's a unisex but I'm pretty sure this isn't men's sizes and yeah so let's get into the shoe It also says tennis for some reason I guess this is a tennis shoe so this is the first look at them it is leather it is very soft leather I don't know if that has anything it's very it feels very good quality also these these retail for $90 I got mine from Paxon for on sale and then I had like some like their like rewards cash too so I got I picked them up for about $60 so they have these air holes on the front and it's all of this the all this leather is all it's all of its top leather and it's like this off-white vintagey color and then it has this is very grippy texture to the sole so the bottom of the sole don't mind that I wore them for like two seconds and it's like this darker tan color it says rebok this little swirly thing there and this is the one's inside part so this is what you don't see when you're walking and it has like this Gap here which is like rock material that's like the only way I can describe it it's a different kind of foam this is like hard rubber this is like this is like a basketball this is like a Croc that's as easy that's how I'm going to explain it and it's pretty blank on this side then this is the front where the first part you see like any detail to anything is the shoelaces obviously and then the rebok tag on these it says rebok and it's I got the green way it's green and then it has like this little red I don't know exactly what that is meant for but that's how it is then if you flip to this side you have the UK flag I'm pretty sure and the rebok in green on the side here and then it is this like same leather material all around and then on the back it says rebok in green and like this retro looking logo or I think that is just her logo how is my dog okay so and then the rest of the tag it says Athletes Shoe and you can probably hear pause to read if you want to read this um I'll read it anyway but it says from a tradition of over a hundred years these handmade athletic shoes meet the demand for Quality performance required for today's athlete and then so little details that are about the shoe this part here is not from being worn that is just like the Vintage look I think it looks pretty cool also this is all around here is like this soft material which is pretty nice and so with this part it's like a different soft material but in the inside you see there that green writing it says rebok on the foam which looks pretty cool so that's the shoe now let's get into the shoe on foot all right so these are what the shoes look like on foot as you can see D I'm just wearing nikie socks and these are what they look like from a higher point of view,2025-06-19 08:38:10.923834 UTC
WoMLtJZYp1w,Veja Esplar,hey guys welcome back to my channel and hello if you are new here today i'm so excited to be doing an unboxing and a review video of visual trainers now i'm really not good at pronouncing things and i've watched so many videos and listen to so many different people some people say visual some people say vedja some people say vajra so anyway this brand i'm going to talk about these trainers because everyone is wearing them so why am i doing a video about these trainers because they are on everyone's feet right now they have been for like the last two years and i am late on the hype and i just thought why are people talking about these why are they so good so i got two of the most popular pairs and thought i would talk you through them so first things first let's just get straight into it and let's talk about why this brand has just kind of taken over this sneaker industry now i've watched lots of videos about the brand itself and they just talk about how they basically wanted to reinvent this sneaker they wanted to reinvent like a product that everyone wears and it comes with a little booklet when you get your products they actually i believe started in france basically they started in 2005 and they create sneakers in a different way mixing social projects economic justice and ecological materials they use brazilian and peruvian organic cotton for the canvas and laces amazonian robert for the soles and various innovative materials such as recycled plastic bottles so a lot of people do say that these are sustainable trainers in terms of price point of the trainers they are more expensive than your standard trainer they actually start from around 95 pounds and go up to around 125 pounds depending on where you're buying them from and i will leave links below where they are in stock and obviously that's more expensive than your traditional kind of white sneaker like stan smith which i think is super comfortable and is on par with these and so i will link those below as well if you do want like an affordable comfortable trainer but basically that's a background so let's go into the trainer so we have the campo trainer first now the campo is basically the one that everyone is obsessed with and i think people are obsessed with it because they say it's just a really smart looking chunky trainer i liken this to when i need to go on a really long walk but i want to pop into a really nice brunch spot on route and i want to look nice but i need phil to get my steps in and it's not always easy to get your steps in in really nice say gucci shoes or something and you just need a nice pair of trainers i think the leather is so stunning on them and it really does make a gorgeous trainer as much as i love my adidas stan smith for some reason this brand does seem more premium i mean it is it's more expensive it's not a sports brand as such it's more of like i would say a looks trainer brand that happens to be sustainable too people say that this is the most comfortable trainer ever and you can get this in different colors depending on where you buy it from i actually like the black i thought the black was really cool and obviously you can tie the lace in whichever way you wish but i just think how gorgeous it has this kind of quite nice chunky sole i just feel like this would go with everything whether it's a little mini skirt a little cute tennis skirt or obviously jeans i have friends who wear these all the time they have kind of replaced their converse and they're just that smart gorgeous shoe now most of you will know that i am a huge meghan markle fan i think her fashion is just amazing i love the way she dresses and actually meghan markle wore the v10 so i did some research i was like what's the difference between the v10s so i'm going to pop a picture of the v10 on screen here i would say the v10 are actually more sporty they kind of have the breathing holes in front of the toe and they're also a little bit higher i personally think these look smarter but it's completely up to you and from what i've seen these are actually the ones that everyone is wearing so next up the second pair that again everyone is talking about are these ones so these are different i mean these are vibrant i only got this color because it was the only color available these trainers seem to sell out very quickly now these are the s blah and again i might be pronouncing that wrong but these are basically canvas so if we do a comparison of the two they do look very similar apart from this is a little bit chunkier on the sole and this is actually a canvas material whereas this is leather now i do believe you can get the espla in the leather however i would say that i probably won't be keeping the canvas one because i don't want canvas shoes i feel like they will get absolutely battered you can apparently just clean this with cold water and some soap but i feel like i need leather trainers because i need that durability from my trainers i do actually quite like the pink i don't know what you guys think let me know would you prefer a canvas trainer or would you prefer a leather trainer the camera feels more sturdy as well and this one definitely feels a lot kind of thinner not flimsy but just thinner more breathable probably more of a complete summer shoe in comparison to this which is kind of all seasons so basically the woman's espla are just a low top canvas trainer whilst the campo are the leather ones with a chunkier sole and a wider fit now i am basically a duck i have such wide feet so the white ones are going to be better for me so in terms of durability honestly i have watched so many videos on these babies and so many people say they've worn them over 100 times into the ground and sizing-wise they just got their standard size so i cannot wait to keep wearing these and report back and let you know how i get on with them so like i say in terms of costs they're not the cheapest trainers they are you know made for premium materials they are made more sustainably and of course that means that the price is going to go up the brand itself says that the cost is higher because of the production process they actually said somewhere that it cost them five times more to produce their trainers than other brands now don't quote me on that but that is apparently what they said they said it's down to the materials that they use as well so that's an interesting point if you are looking for maybe some more sustainable trainers and yeah i just thought it would be nice to finally get my hands on some unbox them talk you through it talk you through my research and see what you guys think as well like i say they are the hottest trainer right now everyone is wearing them they look so classy they are such an easy wear they go with every single outfit every time i see people wearing them i'm like you look amazing you know you can go on a nice long walk and feel comfortable but then you can't pop into brunch and you don't feel like you're wearing your running trainers if it's somewhere say that maybe you want to wear smart trainers too so there we have it guys thank you so much for watching this video do leave a comment if you have any of these trainers or if you're looking to buy any and i will speak to you guys soon you can follow me on instagram shell x thank you so much for watching,2025-06-23 14:57:50.165402 UTC
O6NxaH3DN4E,Converse Chuck Taylor All Star,hey guys welcome back to my channel and welcome to today's video so in today's video I will be reviewing the converse platform sneakers if you're new here hi my name is Angela and I'm so happy that you're here if you love anything fashion I would love it for you to subscribe to my channel and if you do so don't forget to turn on the Bell notifications so you won't miss out on any of my new videos now grab your snack your drink and let's jump right into the video alright alright so I have both pairs you guys I have it in black and in white so let me just start with the black one this is what it looks like I love that the detail is black and white and also on the back it's just like your regular Converse except for the platform Sole and I just love these so so much I think they're so easy to style you've probably seen this all over Instagram and Pinterest a lot of influencers wear this and I got influence as well when I saw these I was like oh my goodness because I always had a love for like the classic Converse Chuck Taylors and I knew that I wanted this pair as soon as I saw them because I love platform shoes anything platforms even now when we look at like the Uggs platforms they're just so adorable and I really really love these now this is the one in white and I love that this Stitch here is black because I think on the regular classic it's like either a navy and a red I would say but everything here is just black and white even for the logo and I just love how minimal it looks and again this one I wore all over summer this year this is my favorite like summer sneaker it is so so easy to style as well honestly I could just not pick between black and white I think you need them both both and they're just such a staple in my wardrobe now let's talk about sizing so my regular shoe size is a us-7 and that is a European 38 and I actually size down quite a bit with this one I actually got this in a European 37 so I think usually I would be a European 38 and then I thought I would have to size down half a size which is 37.5 but I actually sized down a whole size to European 37 and that is a us-6 to be honest I regret it a little bit so when I went to Paris for the summer I wore these two the black and the white ones we were walking a lot and exploring the whole city so I feel like the 37 and a half was a little bit bigger than I would usually go for so I thought you know what instead of sizing down half a size I will do a full size and when I try them on in the store it was perfect I thought yes these fit great in the front in the bag on the sides I will go for a 37 and when I went to Paris last summer I took these babies with me and I wore them every day I would walk in these babies for like 12 hours a day and they hurt and I think it's my own fault because I should have just gone down half a size and I didn't I did a full size right so that is something to note that you'll probably have to size down but do not size down a whole size I would probably just size down half a size and it's just also nice to have a little bit of extra space in case you want to wear thicker socks in the winter days just please don't make the same mistake as I did now funny enough even though I got them both in the same size I feel like the white one is just a tad bigger I feel like the black one is a little little bit more snug so on the inside the sole is very very comfortable it's kind of cushiony which makes it very comfortable if you walk for long hours and what I also like is that the material is also a tiny bit cushiony but I think that is because it's double lined so it's just nice to have that because you definitely feel it when you have it on and they do not dig into my heels whatsoever so I do consider these very very comfortable again I feel like I could get away with it if I just wear it for let's say like six to eight hours but because I should have sized down half the size and this is a full size after 12 hours my feet hurt now I also brought these on my last trip to Bangkok and it was pouring every single day I wore this in crazy weather condition they're definitely not waterproof or anything they will get wet but what I like is because of the platform it won't get into the soul so of course all these parts because they're exposed to the Rain would get wet but the inside wasn't wet and because the platform is quite big the rain would maybe only be up to like here or maybe a little bit up to here now I just think these are classic classic sneakers you could wear this with shorts with denim with trousers with a skirt with a mini dress I just think these are super adorable and they just go with literally everything if you think about getting these I highly recommend them I do think they are worth the price now if you guys would want to see a styling video on these babies please let me know in the comments down below I would love to do a little lookbook styling the converse platforms but I think it's safe to say that these are my favorite everyday sneakers they're so classic but they're still stylish and I just love these so so much and that is a for today's video guys thank you so much for watching this mini review on the conference platforms and if you like this video don't forget to give it a thumbs up and make sure before you leave that you're subscribed to my channel love you guys and see you in the next video bye,2025-06-23 11:21:40.759495 UTC
l_I3cx_6KvM,Veja Esplar,hey guys welcome back to my channel i hope you are well i just want to start this video by saying i'm really sorry if the likey's changing we are having like four seasons in one today we've had rain we've had snow we've had hail and now we have bright sunshine so i believe the light's probably gonna drop again in a second but i just wanted to start the video by apologizing so i hope you guys are well and if you've been following me on instagram stories you'll see i've been doing a lot of travels recently and you will probably notice that these babies came with me so if you are new to my channel you probably won't have seen it but if you are an og to my channel you probably saw that i did a review of asia trainers so so long ago so i thought it was time to do an update i got lots of questions asking me how i'm getting on with them if i'm actually finding them comfy and i think it's really important after doing an unboxing to actually say okay let's be critical this is how good or bad they are these are the things i love these are things i hate they're obviously an expensive trainer so i thought it would be a good time to do a proper full-blown review and now i've had a chance to wear them in so if you don't know the brand i'm pronouncing it invasion but it might be pronounced baja i heard someone the other day said like that avery i don't know it could be pronounced in whichever way you guys decide to pronounce it i'm probably pronouncing it wrong but i'm going to call them phasers they are absolutely beautiful trainers you can get so many different types and my absolute favorite are the baja espla again i'm probably pronouncing that wrong but i just think they're absolutely divine basically a gorgeous pair of leather sneakers with a rubber sole however the reason people have gone so wild for this brand is because they are not your average pair of sneakers so the brand is basically a social kind of brand they say social first and sales second they basically mix social projects economic justice and even environmental things to make this brand which i think is amazing people love sustainable products and they want products in their life that are going to last forever and they say that they want these trainers to be on your life for 10 years and i am here for that there's actually a post on my blog with a guide to my top trainers whether you're looking for something to go on long walks in whether you're looking for something to run runs in so i will leave that below it's just mtalks.com so you guys can check that out as well so for me i'm someone that really likes going on long walks and i'm someone that likes to go for food and if i'm saying in new york i don't want to wear gym trainers because gym trainers and running trainers are very different to nice sneakers these are the perfect kind of beautiful pair of sneakers that actually look good with your dress and actually you look good with your jeans but they look good enough and well they're not designer but high-end enough to go to like a beautiful restaurant or a beautiful brunch without feeling as if you just finished a run you know and that's kind of what i'm always looking for there's these ones and then there's a pair that i'll pop on screen which are usually around 50 off so i'll link those below they're my two kind of go-to's that actually look good with my outfits but i can actually walk a lot of steps in them so that was kind of my reason for wanting some beiges i wanted to mix up my all white ones that i just showed on the screen with something else it was just a really nice high quality brand that i'm going to have for years that actually looks good with my outfits but it's comfortable so the brand uses brazilian and peruvian cotton for the laces and then amazonian rubber for the soles i'm not going to show you the soles because they're dirty and they basically use innovative materials to make these trainers so things like recycle polyester or recycle plastic bottles i mean i think that is very cool this brand is a sustainable and ethical brand which i think is fantastic they use upcycling so that they can produce things seasonally and actually when i was in paris a few weeks ago i did sport in galleries lafayette they had a repair center for vegas which again helps with their sustainability project so i'm gonna leave a link below so you can find out more about the brand because i don't want to kind of bore you but i also think it's really important that that kind of helps justify the price point they really are ethically made sustainably made and i think that's why everyone's obsessed with them and the fact that they're super comfy so back up to what i was saying they are so so so comfy so as soon as you take them out of the box they are ready to wear unlike the white ones i popped on screen they kind of take a few words to get molded into your feet and to be comfortable i promise i took these straight out of the box and i did like a two hour walk in them and they were so so so comfortable the only thing that i found uncomfortable about them and it took about an hour and a half for this to happen and i had read reviews warning me about this is i don't know what you call this do you call it like the lip well this part of the trainer or sneaker basically rubs into you i don't know why but that basically rubs into you and i've never ever ever had that on a pair of trainers so that is the worst thing about these trainers however there is a hack and i've seen so many things online if you type in like evasia espla hack this comes up or the tongue is called it's called the tongue hack you basically just push it to the side when you're wearing them and then it doesn't hurt anymore so that's the only annoying thing when you're wearing it for a very very long period but the positive to take from that is that you can wear them for long periods as long as the tongue is tucked in or you're wearing appropriate socks and my socks were like lower than it which is why it was rubbing onto my foot so you can wear them i've managed to do 20 000 30 000 steps in them they're not battered they're not damaged they're beautiful hard wearing leather even though it's smooth leather which i was a little bit worried about they still look absolutely gorgeous the soles still look gorgeous if not a little bit dirty because i like white china's um but they still look absolutely beautiful and of course you could take the laces out and pop them in the washing machine i'm unsure how you would wash your actual trainers i usually throw my trainers in the washing machine but i really don't want to break these and ruin them but i would say they are heavy duty and hardwiring and great for lots and lots of steps i'm very wide footed and i got my standard size a size uk six and trust me i'm like a dog and these were so comfy like i say straight out of the box i did not need to hold my feet to them i didn't need to walk around for two hours because i thought oh i might get blisters none of that happened they were just comfortable apart from the tub so in terms of the look i think the silhouette is absolutely gorgeous they have almost like a boiler shoe you know like if you're going bowling but and when i wear bowling shoes i like really ugly because the colors are horrible but the way that it fits on like the front of my foot i always think oh that's really flattering i think they're just really flattering because they kind of go thin here i have wide feet and my feet don't look wide in them i actually think my feet look really nice in them so i feel like they're very flattering to wear they look very slimline so they look gorgeous with like jeans or trousers or leggings one with my leggings the other day and a new jumper that i bought i love it and i just felt like i don't know like i'm walking on air they feel lightweight they look lightweight and they just look easy they're just easy to wear with any outfit in terms of support they're not heavily cushioned but they do provide enough firm support so that you can wear them for 20 000 steps and feel as if your feet are secure and comfy in terms of how on earth i'm going to keep them clean i actually bought something for my boucle chairs which you spray on like leather and you spray on suede and i think i'm going to spray on these because apparently if anything gets on them you can then wipe it off i think that's my next thing to do because i don't want them to get ruined but obviously white trainers wearing them every day they are inevitably going to get some wear and tear if you have any other questions about the trainers please do leave them below i would love to help you but i just wanted to give a really quick whistle stop tour of these price range it depends where you buy them from and i'm going to leave some links below i'll let you know if they're on discount anywhere as well but generally these are around 100 pounds i paid 100 for these to 145 pounds depending on which color which depending on which color you get and where you get them from so i will link them below i know that sounds expensive but considering how sustainably sourced they are that's actually really great and if they are gonna last you for 10 years then um that's really really great so i hope you like this video and thank you so much as always for watching let me know if there's anything else you would like me to review or talk about and let me know if you have these trainers thank you guys see you next time,2025-06-23 14:57:44.038763 UTC
w42-85t1x0M,ASICS GEL-LYTE III,hey guys what's going on before i get this video started I just wanted to let you sort of give you an a channel update what we're going to be doing now is I'm going to stick with the unboxing videos those are going to be sort of the only thing that stays in the channel I guess the only two things are the unboxing videos right now and the weekly sneaker rotations which I am doing away with just because I don't have that many shoes and I don't want things to get repetitive and making videos just for the sake of making videos so what we're going to be doing is I'm going to be doing let's say I get in a shoe let's say in about a month or something I by the UI by the North Carolina UNC ones which I most likely will be buying but I get those in I do the unboxing that's normal and then what we're going to do is I'm going to show you an in-depth video of what the materials are like the little different sort of features on them the details you know just give you a closer look at them and then give you an on foot video just kind of odd be having three videos per shoe pretty much um met I depending on what shoot it I may or may not do and with some of the ones I already have uh if like they're already beat I'm not going to really show you I might show you an on foot but i'm not going to do over keep a review probably going to do it on foot for most of them but just wanted to give you guys that before this video get started hey guys what's going on today we've got an in-depth look and review of the asics gel lyte 3 in the future camo colorway if you haven't already seen my unboxing video please go ahead and watch that I gonna have the link up up here somewhere but i'm just going to show you the one shoe because it's not like the what the are there different but what we're looking at here is mainly a black leather upper you got that sort of like but actually the midsole right here is a grey and then it the midsole what we're looking at it's grey here white red and then grey all the way back around until it gets back to the White you've got on the inside got the asics logo got that minty green liner and then an insole along with the minty green laces and sort of like the green kind of outlined for the asics logo on the side here also on that side and then my favorite part about the shoe is what they call the future camo and I honestly can't say why it's this why it's called that but it's I just think it looks really nice um and I think this is one of my favorite ASIC gel lyte threes that they've released in a while and no hype on this one seeing I mean I got this for like forty dollars from finish line if you I might have to look into these and just kind of find out why this colorway is called the future camo but I actually haven't worn these yet I was just about to wear them but i figured for you guys i would do and review and look at them first before get somewhere into them while they're still dead stock but give you a look at the back there the red asics logo and the green gel logo behind that a that mesh a closer look you like three logo see that leather what else the toe box is kind of toe box isn't leather it's just kind of like a plush soft kind of mesh like material I guess but not completely see around the laces we've got the red eyelets I might have to swap the laces out on these for baby some shorter ones because you can see here there really like pulled out and they're still like that far out so when I tie them actually time they are the laces go out to like here and I I don't really like that on the bottom we've got mostly black made up with a few hits of the mint green along with the red around the back um really that's about it for this shoe if you guys are interested not only in buying this pair specifically but any asics gel lyte threes I was thinking that I was going to have to go half size up at least um but they didn't have anything bigger than a 13 but the 13 works perfectly I've heard people say go half size up go a size up I don't see that I think you can go true to size in these and usually when people say go a half size up I have to follow that rule because my foots I'm just kind of pretty big but true to size on these you can definitely i'll have some links in the description below to where you can find maybe not this shoe specifically but some other gel lyte threes but that's all for the review guys stay tuned for the on foot section not investigated video in a separate video but that will be coming up next and I will see you guys next time,2025-06-23 14:47:22.679550 UTC

LxTRqg0K4Fw,on cloudmonster 2,hey people welcome to the Run testers and in this video we are looking at the followup to one of On's most popular recent shoes we've had the new oncloud monster 2 in for the Run tester treatment now the first gen monster was a big stack highly rocket daily trainer that many used for easier miles but could move up the gears a bit too so what's new with the Gen 2 well on says this reimagined monster now has extreme cushioning that's been maximized for unreal bounce if you found the first shoe a little stiff or firm that might be just exactly what you wanted to hear but have we got a better monster on our hands here well here is what we made of it in our multi-tester review of the oncloud monster 2 some quick details then starting with the biggest stack that now comes in at 35 Ms in the heel and 29 m in the for foot that's up 6 millim across the entire midso versus the first gen which had 29 Ms in the hill and 23 in the 4ot but the drop stays at 6 mm when it comes to weight it lands at 10.5 o or 297 G in my UK men's 8 and 1 half test shoe size that's about an ounce or 20 G heavier than the old monster price-wise it's also gotten heftier it's now 170 in the UK up20 on the last gen it's not so bad State side but it still rises to £179.99 in the US that puts it at the same price as the cloud eclipse and makes it one of the priciest daily trainers going so let's give you a quick Whistle Stop of the cloud monster 2 starting with the midsole which has a new dual density foam construction with cushioning increased to a maximum it's a surprise not to see the domino effect Cloud elements that we got on the eclipse we thought that might come to the monster instead you've still got the regular kind of cloud Tech here those little bubbles there's a nylon blend speed board plate in the middle of that midsole that's been reshaped with the aim of working with that midsole to provide greater efficiency from touchdown to toe off up top you've got relatively flexible breathable uppers that are virtually identical if not identical to the first generation they are quite structured but with some perforations here to boost the breathability the heel collar carry pretty much the same medium padding as the first gen it's perhaps marginally more cushy overall just very very slightly the thin tongues are pretty similar too perhaps there's a smid and less structure to them they're a little bit more flexible versus the first gen the lacing structure remains largely the same though the eyelets here have been swapped from those sort of fabric tabs to these kind of stitch like Loops flip them over and you've got a similar covering of out soole rubber the grip patterns have changed on these little elements here with larger studs the other big thing to note is that deep middle Groove here has been filled in uh there's still a central Channel but it looks 100% less Stone catchy now when it comes to fit and testing I ran in my regular UK and a half that's the same size I ran in the original Monster if I was being generous I'd say I found the whole thing roomy but in truth I thought everything was just a touch loose and lacked like a 100% reliable dialed in feel the heel hold wasn't as secure as I'd like and I had to really draw the laces quite tight across the midfoot to get that locked down and even then it didn't feel quite right I had sort of no real problems Pera rubbing or hotpots but I don't think I'd go half a size down but I wasn't convinced by the fit overall so the fit of the cloud monster 2 was really good for me in my normal running shoe size the uk9 here which is a us99.5 it's got enough room in the toe box for sure I've got enough of a secure hold around the heel and midfoot as well there's not loads of padding around the shoe on the color and tongue which is a bit different to lots of very cushion shoes but it's still a really comfortable fit nice breathable upper yeah all around no concerns at all with the fit in my normal size so fit for me the cloud monster 2 I think it's actually been better than it was on the original cloud monster I think with the first shoe I definitely found it sat a little bit snug up front here in the toe box and I do think that has changed and I had that in a UK size eight this is a UK size eight as well too but what I think has changed it definitely feels a lot R up in the front of this shoe and I think that's for the better I have found it in general a more comfortable shoe and a less snug fitting shoe in my usual kind of size I would go in on shoes and other Road running shoes as well too elsewhere it's pretty much a similar story from the first shoe I think you get a good hold in the midfoot it's a similar style um tongue and laces combination so and those kind of sat very snug and you know securely for me and it's a similar level of heel padding as well no slippage no issues in terms of lockdown at the hill so from that point of view all very similar I think the main thing for me is that the original did feel a little bit snug in the toes I definitely think that has changed it just because on I think it's opened up what you get here in the front of the shoe and I think it's definitely for the positive overall so then in testing I've run around 50 miles in the cloud monster 2 I did plenty of that long and slow from plotting up to marathon pace I also did a progression run that took me from easy to 10K Pace most of that was on roads some of it was on the river pars next to the river temps and I also did a few kilom on the treadmill to boot now for a long time Honor's comeing for criticism for its shoes being too firm too stiff sometimes lacking the energy of Rivals the cloud Monster's big stack of helium was a response to that but while it added more Mido for a soft and more cushioned ride than many of On's other shoes what I really liked about the cloud monster was it actually retained some of that firmness and stiffness I was adding a bit more cushion and that worked with the rocker to make it snappier and more responsive than many of the max cushion Rivals that were out there if felt like it kind of had different gears you know you could go from slow to more uptempo now the first thing you notice with the monster 2 is that it's much softer that bigger stack has made it much squigger Under Foot so if you thought the original Monster though was still wasn't soft enough for you you might actually really like this upgrade for me personally however I think it's doled the ride and with the extra weight you were getting in the shoe everything is now just a bit more clumpy just a bit more flaccid it's not as Snappy it's not as versatile and I think the overall feel on the foot is much more baggy and look loose it just lacks the Precision that you got in the last gen to keep your feet feeling cradled so along with all that extra weight and the soften ride there's just something a bit flat about the whole thing with this shoe stability though is pretty good thanks to a big wide base that you've still got here and when it comes to durability I think the uppers here should last as well as the first gen which was pretty good when you flip them over the out soes are almost identical and those did tend to show weing all the kind of key impact zones on the heels and that as you racked up the miles in the first gen so they're not the most durable out soes and I'm not really seeing anywhere right now I expect those to perform pretty much the same because they haven't changed too much now another good thing I do like is that sort of main channel here the original cloud monster was a shoe that did grow on me over time I think it was a pretty interesting cushion shoe it wasn't maxed out in terms of Stack height and it wasn't very soft but it was reasonably protective it was comfortable to use for a variety of runs and had a little bit of Versatility that you don't always see from cushion shoes it's not like it was one of my favorite shoes out there but I thought it was a pretty good shoe and almost marked the new direction from on moving away from the very similar style of shoes they'd had for lots of shoes towards slightly more cushioned and interesting offerings that led to things like the cloud Surfer and Cloud Eclipse which I do think are very good shoes the cloud monster 2 hasn't really hit home for me I'd say it's not really a shoe I've really uh meshed with very well during my run test like I think it's okay but I don't think it's an improvement on the original shoe and I don't think it stands out compared to On's other shoes or indeed other cushion shoes on the market you got this increased stack height uh which obviously adds to the weight of the shoe and I think it is quite a heavy shoe now especially if you think the stack heite is 35 mm it's coming in as heavy or heavier lots of shoes that hit 40 mm so the cloudtech Helen combo has never been the lightest and I think that does stand out with the new oncloud monster 2 even compared to the oncloud monster one which I do think was quite a light feeling shoe on the foot this feels quite big quite heavy really pushes it very much into that category of easy recovery day shoe and for that it's got quite a firm stiff ride now I'm sure there'll be people out there who quite like that and think you know because it is quite different in the cushion shoe world to have a ride like that and it's naturally quite stable as a result but it's not really what I'm looking for and I'm going out for a nice easy run I want a slightly softer feel or I want a very rocket shoe or anything really that gives me a bit more of a feeling of comfort and makes me look forward to those easy runs a bit more like I didn't mind running in the shoe but I did find pling through easy runs or recovery runs I'm quite deep into marathon training right now high mileage weeks for me and pulling this one for my recovery runs felt fine it was protective enough but it didn't feel as good as pulling on like a range of other shoes that either a bit softer or for notably more rocked I like a more rocked shoe just to roll through those easy runs and yeah it was okay but yeah quite Firma I do think that's an odds with lots of shoes out there I think it's probably more of an acquired taste as it always has been kind of with on shoes you've got there's that more of an acquired taste to them and I think you still have that with a cloud monster 2 but it's a bit beefier a bit heavier Without Really adding a load of comfort so don't necessarily think the changes have worked that much in the midell for me just you know making it bigger has reduced what was some of the appeal of the cloud monster for me without adding loads and loads of comfort there so while it does you protect the legs I K yeah it doesn't feel uh particularly plush and cushioned underfoot or like I said doesn't have much of a rocker so while the run test was fine for me I've done about you 45 50k of running in the shoe during High marage weeks and you know it's fulfilled its job fine I think there are shoes I would reach for ahead of it uh to do that job so into that run test I have to say my experience with the original oncloud Monster now it definitely at that time was On's best shoe probably the shoe I had the best experience with but it still was a little bit firm I still wanted a little bit more out of it I didn't quite feel like it had the same versatility that maybe some of the other guys in the team thought it did I still thought it was a shoe that you'd use for kind of easy kind of recovery runs slow runs definitely had a lot of protection and it was very stable I think there are traits of that sort of similar traits in the oncloud monster 2 I think there are some changes some I think you know have they absolutely worked I'm not entirely convinced here one thing I definitely noticed when I first put this on my first run and that was kind of8 mil mil and it was kind of eight kind of 18 minute mile Pace I dropped it down below that so to go and pick the pace up a little bit had some kind of long stretches to run on and I think ultimately what I found is now the still cloudtech it is I say you know it does feel a little bit softer the design of the pods have changed they're a little bit smaller in comparison to the ones on the original on cloud monster so it's almost like you've got a few more in there so it feels a little bit tighter in terms of that design and you know as say you press into it you definitely feel they are little bit softer feeling uh just pressing into that mid ultimately the feeling of it you know it's still a little on the firm side for me a little bit firmer than I would expect I still think it is a very protective ride a very stable ride in general there's a little bit of Bounce The Rocker isn't massively pronounced here um you know particularly think of what has happened with things like the cloud Surfer and the on cloud Eclipse I was almost hoping that maybe that's how on would push the cloud monster 2 on and have maybe an amalgamation of what we got on the on cloud eclipse and the on cloud Surfer and really build that into on cloud monster I think that was a direction it needed to go with this shoe But ultimately what it's probably thought here is that we still you know still people want that kind of firmer feeling kind of Max kushin Shu but almost Tred to say well we're going to soften it up a little bit but I don't think it's really been enough and it almost sits in between the two things in terms of being you know Fir and maybe not soft enough to give you that kind of you know kind of ride that you know you do get from something like the on cloud Eclipse as I said you know I haven't had a bad run in this shoe but I think you know I a bit like the first shoe I don't think it had the versatility for me you know the the kind of quicker runs it was fine it can handle it but I just think you just feel this shoe a lot more than the original it just feels heavier it's definitely heavier you know we've tested shoes that have gone heavier than their predecessors and I think things that come to like P velocity Nitro 3 it's a different shoe But ultimately I don't think the added weight has been at De detent of the experience of running that shoe compared to its previous shoe but I think with the cloud monster 2 I do think you notice this shoe a lot more I think you know when you want a Sho to kind of disappear when you are running those longer miles I don't think you get that with a cloud monster 2 as I said I think there's Hallmarks of the original I think it is a ride that is protective I think it stable I think you know there is some bounce and there is a little bit of a a kind of a rocker in there but not a huge amount there but I doely don't know if this has really pushed things forward in terms of what we saw on the original cloud monster and I also think just because of what's happening around its On's range with the cloud Sur and the cloud Eclipse I almost hoped it would go in that direction but it hasn't really gone a Direction so for me the cloud monster has been a Solitude to running it has it really pushed things on I'm not 100% convinced and I was almost hoping maybe on would go a little bit of a different direction and also think the added weight issue really that's the thing that's really stood out for me that is really s you know alter the experience of this compared to the original oncloud Monster which I think you know you could almost live with some of the other aspects because the weight was good the cushioning you know level of cushioning was good and if you wanted that slightly firmer ride and protective ride then it had that I think with the cloud monster 2 it almost feels like it's caught between two things that on wants it this shoe to be ultimately it's falling a little bit somewhere in the middle where as I said I don't think it's really pushed things forward for the cloud monster and on in this range now verdict then I really like the oncloud monster the first gen I enjoyed it a lot for a lot of varied miles it was a great chew to choose if you weren't really sure how you'd run that day so I was hoping for good things from the second gen but this upgrade for me you know the changes that you've got here with the bigger stack the softer midsole the extra weight the bigger price tag to me they don't add up to a better shoe this is one where I think they've taken a step back the fit is a bit sloppy the ride is okay but it's lost some of the livel of the original monster that's been replaced by kind of mushier ACC cushioning that's not as plush as Rivals like the Nimbus or the 1080 v13 I think the shoe now Falls between two stalls where it's not got that really really pillowy cushioned sort of daily trainer thing going on but it's also lost a snap of some of the faster miles so it's a bit confused I much prefer the cloud Eclipse which is the same price and the same weight I definitely also choose the original cloud monster over this update not least because it's a chunk cheaper and for me I'd definitely pick up the ride 17 soer ride 17 over this one as well so verdict on the cloud Master 2 for me is that it's a shoot that doesn't really work so well for me and I don't think the changes have necessarily improved it for me as a runner it's not one I'd really uh go for myself it's quite expensive now as well there's quite a big price rise which is a bit of a shame because it was one of the cheaper shoes in the on- range in a way the cushion shoes and yeah it doesn't really stand out now for me on the market because you know it's got that different feeling that firmer stiffer feeling but it doesn't translate to it being a more versatile shoe than loads of other cushion shoes that are a bit softer or bouncier or more rocked or just lighter whilst having more cushioning and a lot of them are cheaper too so yeah it makes it hard for me to recommend the cloud monster 2 you know it's okay does its job prefer the CL moner one also prefer the cloud Surfer which is a softer shoe not sure it's like the best of very long runs all the time but I do think it's a much more fun shoe to run around in for kind of shorter daily mileage it's a bit more verstile it's a lot lighter it's softer and more cushioned it's got that very smooth Cloud Tech phase cushioning and the cloud eclips I think is a more accomplished shoe around if you're looking for a maxed out shoe with a really good rocker on it it's efficient ride that means it is a bit more versatile than the cloud monster 2 for sure and I found it probably a bit more comfortable for easy runs as well because of the way the rocker moves you through your foot strike outside of on are Lo of shoes I've be looking at instead of it including some that are fair bit cheaper like the Brooks ghost Max the pum magnify Nitro 2 really like both those shoes as cushion shoes that do a good job on easy runs a little bit of Versatility but in general they just nice mileage you know munchers and they do that a really good job of that and then there's things like s trium 21 ride 17 which I also think just better all around cushion shoes there's lots of shoes in this area I think with on obviously getting the paying a little bit of premium for the great design and lots of people would like to use these as casual shoes as well I work for a casual shoe for a very long pub crawl on Saturday and you know protected the legs quite well on that considering I did that after a 20- mile run but you know looking at purely on performance I think there are better cushion shoes out there certainly better value options and I just don't like I say the changes made here hav really improved the experience of running in the shoe for me uh what I do think the cloud monster just as a slightly more enjoyable shoe to use that because it was that little bit more Nimble so my verdict on the oncloud monster 2 is that if we look back to the original the first shoe I think that was a real pivotal moment for on shoes and terms of Direction I feel like it needed to go I didn't absolutely love that shoe but I could definitely appreciate the changes or the the direction on was going with that shoe and I feel like it was a positive move for on overall now with the cloud lster to is that pushing things forward I'm not entirely sure it has I do feel like it's a shoe that doesn't disappear in the same way that the cloud monster did I think that it feels a little bit heavier um you know I think you know when you see what an has done with the cloud Surfer and the cloud Eclipse particularly and the way those shoes have kind of Taken kind of its cushioning Tech technology I feel like this is almost trying to be a bit of both things and ultimately it kind of sits somewhere in the middle and I don't think it as I said I don't really think it really matches what we got on the on cloud monster the original and it it just feels like a little bit out of place for me I I don't think it really pushes the range forward and you know if it was me and I had to pick between this and the on cloud monster and saying that you know I didn't absolutely love the cloud monster I would be going for the original I think as I said I feel that that the weight of that shoot just works a bit better the experience the versatility of that shoe that it does have albeit being a little bit firmer than some some other Max cushion shoes I do think there was a lot more things to you know kind of praise it for I think the cloud monster 2 is a solid shoe but I think when you think where it's come from I don't think as I said I don't think it's really pushing forward in terms of their R and I just think when you look at something of the oncloud Eclipse which I think it's a shoe that I've really loved running I still love running in and I know it's a different experience a little bit of a softer experience in terms of that Mido technology I think that's where on needs to go with its kind of Max Cush approach and ultimately I think I was hoping maybe that's what we'd get with the cloud monster to disappointedly that's not what we've got here said I think it is a good Max cushion shoe I haven't had a bad run but I can't say I've had really memorable you know spectacular runs in this shoe that made me think actually this is a step up from the original cloud monster so for me yeah maybe a little bit of a Miss for me with the cloud monster 2 you know I would probably go still up for the original ultimately I'd be going for the cloud Eclipse over this different exper but ultim I think a better kind of Max cushion style shoe that's a bit more versatile a bit better in terms of overall weight and just feels like a Slicker kind of operate in general as well so there you have it that's been our multitester review of the new oncloud monster 2 hope you found it enlightening and helpful if so we'd love it if you'd be so kind as to hit like maybe even share this

this shoe and we hope to see you again soon on the Run testers thanks for watching people and happy running out there,2025-06-23 14:41:03.640133 UTC
J7l8dIh0p6E,on cloudmonster 2,"hey welcome to the channel just so we're clear from the start I am not a professional runner i'm just a regular guy who runs who maybe obsesses a little much over running shoes today I'm comparing two shoes I've worn a ton the Hoka Clifton 9 and the OnCloud Monster 2 i bought the Clifton 9 back in May of 2024 so I've had those for about a year now look how clean they look when they came out of the box not a scratch on them yeah not quite the same story now but we'll get to that and then there's the Cloud Monster 2OS which I picked up in July of 2024 so they're about 2 months younger these things look like they were straight out of Star Wars when I unboxed them sleek kind of wild looking but yeah these have taken some hits too over the past year I've swapped between both pairs while doing my 10,000 steps a day plus a little bit of track work once a week so this review is coming from actual long-term use not just a first impressions vibe and no just to be clear I'm not sponsored by either brand nobody's paying me to say anything here i bought these shoes with my own money and this review is 100% my own opinion now I figured the best way to break this video down is with a Q&A type of format basically I asked myself a bunch of questions that I wish I had answers to before buying these shoes and maybe you had the same questions too so hopefully my experience helps you make a decision and if there's something that I didn't cover feel free to drop your questions in the comment section down below i'm happy to answer whatever you've got first question why did I choose the OnCloud Monster 2OS and the Hoka Clifton 9 to review after dealing with a few frustrating injuries I decided to look for running shoes with a low heel totoe drop i'd been experimenting with barefoot running using popular brands like Vivo Barefoot Zero Shoes and Vibram Shoes unfortunately the experiment didn't go as planned and I ended up getting planter fasciitis and getting some Achilles tendon issues which basically made me not be able to run or walk long distances for about 3 months now to be fair there are plenty of people out there who swear by barefoot shoes i'm just not one of them once I recovered I wanted to change back to traditional running shoes but I didn't want to throw out everything I had learned from my barefoot experience one thing that barefoot running taught me was how impactful heel to toe drop can be most standard running shoes have about 8 to 11 mm of heel totoe drop while barefoot shoes have about 1 to 2 mm i realized that a lower heel totoe drop somewhere between 3 to 5 mm felt better on my knees and align more naturally with how I move interestingly that lower heel totoe drop is also what I prefer in my weightlifting shoes somewhere around 2 to 3 mm and even my everyday sneakers like my Stan Smiths and my OnCloud Rogers so when I came across the Encloud Monster 2os and the Hoka Clifton 9 both with relatively low heel totoe drops they seem like strong contenders and that's what sparked the review why did you test these particular shoes against each other honestly I was seeing the Encloud Monster 2OS and the Hoka Clifton 9 everywhere youtube Instagram you name it as someone who reviews a lot of health and fitness products my feed is constantly filled with ads for running shoes and these two brands seem to dominate during and after the pandemic I felt like an and Hoka were quietly taking over the running world so with both brands catching my eye it made sense to put these brands head-to-head to narrow down my choices I used a site I really liked called runrepeat.com if you're ever shopping for running shoes I highly recommend it they offer super detailed breakdowns rating from one to 100 and even suggest similar shoes based on your preferences you just plug in a type of shoe you're looking for and it will show you a bunch of options tailored to your foot type and running style in my case I have a neutral gate a standard arch and pretty average feet overall based on that input the Cloud Monster 2 rated 89 out of 100 and the Clifton 9ines rated 86 out of 100 popped up as top contenders so they naturally became the two that I wanted to compare are these shoes for runners or walkers it might sound like a funny question at first but it's actually an important one a lot of people assume that if you're just walking you don't really need running shoes but I found if you do as much walking as I do 10,000 steps a day which is actually about 5 miles you definitely want the comfort and support of good running shoes that's a lot of daily wear and tear on your feet and your shoes i wouldn't want to walk 5 miles a day in my Stan Smiths or my Encloud Rogers that would wreck my feet at the same time I'm a runner too once a week my virtual trainer through my future fitness app gives me a running routine each session has about three miles of running in it it's usually a mix of sprints intervals and tempo work which absolutely calls for running shoes so to answer the question I'm both a runner and a walker and that's exactly why I care so much about finding versatile supportive shoes that can handle both which shoe did I think I was going to like more going into the test honestly I didn't have a clear favorite at first but if I had a hunch I actually thought I would not like the Cloud Monster 2 that's because I had a pretty rough experience with a previous Ono the OnCloud 10 which I bought back in June of 2022 the collar on that one was unusually high almost like a midtop and the thin stiff lining rubbed hard against my ankles it was uncomfortable from the start i wore them once and that was enough i sent them straight back so heading into this review I didn't have high hopes for the Encloud Master 2s because I figure they might have the same issues but I kept an open mind because every model is different and sometimes brands learn from earlier missteps was I right well I didn't actually think I'd like the Hoka Clifton 9 either and honestly that was mostly based on looks even though I was skeptical about the OnCloud Monster 2 at least they looked cool i mean come on these things have a vibe they're sleek and modern looking the Clipton 9 on the other hand totally turned me off at first that massive midsole looked cartoonish to me like somebody pumped it full of dermal filler i remember thinking to myself why would anybody need that much shoe i also figured I'd feel pretty ridiculous wearing them but as it turns out looks aren't everything funnily enough I actually thought the Clifton 9 were going to have a higher heel to toe drop ratio because of the thick midsole but I was wrong they actually have a smaller heel totoe drop than the Encloud Monster 2OS 5 mm versus 6 mm so yeah I was wrong on a couple of fronts i'm glad I gave both pairs a fair shot how much did the Cloud Monster 2Os and the Hoka Clifton 9 cost when I bought the OnCloud Monster 2Os about a year ago they ran me 180 bucks the Hoka Clifton 9 were a bit more affordable at 145 bucks now I know that's a lot of money for a pair of running shoes but if you've looked at prices lately you'll see that those prices are pretty standard for higherend running shoes the good news you don't have to pay full price if you shop smart i recently saw on Run Repeat that you can find a pair of Encloud Monster 2 running shoes for between 135 and $144 and the Clifton 9 for around $95 that's not bad so hey look at that i might have already saved you guys some cash what do the shoes look like now we'll start with the OnCloud Monster 2s here's a simple before and after before and after brand new after a year you can immediately see how much dirt the midsoles have picked up since they're white they show everything dust from the streets dirt from the track all of it the upper and laces also absorbed a bit of grime over time inside the shoe the collar looks pretty solid but the heel tap inside the left shoe has begun to wear down there's a small hole forming and if you've had running shoes long enough you know that's only going to get worse flip them over and you'll notice some clear wear on the crush pad and outsole nothing surprising here honestly this is the kind of wear and tear I expect over a year of use no structural issues just standard wear and tear now on to the Hoka Clifton 9 here's a before shot and the after brand new and after a year same story with the dirt and the dust but because they are blue it's a little harder to see still it's there one noticeable difference is the wear and tear on the inside of the heel tabs of both shoes the Hocas wore down a bit faster probably because I use the Hokas more frequently when you flip them over you'll see the outsole and the crush pad have worn down in a similar way to the Enclouds in fact just by comparing the outsoles it's pretty clear which pair saw more miles why did I end up wearing the Hoka Clifton 9 more often simple answer they were just more comfortable overall but the secret might be because of the socks that I wear i usually wear features highperformance tab socks either the ultra light or max cushions versions and they pair perfectly with the Hocas the fit feels spot-on no pressure points no rubbing just easy all day comfort with the Cloud Monster 2s it's a different story when I wear my usual tab socks the thin tongue of the shoe rubs right above the bridge of my foot where it meets the lower shin it's not unbearable but it's definitely noticeable to fix it I have to switch to quarter socks which cover that area and prevent the rubbing but I can still feel it a little bit so because the Hokas work seamlessly with the socks I like one of the reasons being their thicker tongue they ended up getting more use which pair would I buy again if you've been following along this probably won't come as a surprise i'd absolutely buy the Hoka Clifton 9 again in fact I'm probably going to order another pair as soon as I finish filming this video they've become my go-to running and walking shoe and now that they're going for about 95 bucks a pair that's a steal and I don't want to miss out what's amazing to me is I thought I was going to hate this shoe now it's the one that I measure everything else against it's earned the top spot in my rotation and going forward it will be my baseline for testing other running shoes so stay tuned more running shoe comparisons coming soon what score would I give each shoe on a scale of 1 to 10 i'd give the Hoka Clifton 9 a solid 8 out of 10 they're super comfortable versatile and have become my daily go-to as I alluded to earlier there's a little room for improvement maybe in durability and in design but overall they've totally won me over as for the OnCloud Monster 2os I'd give them a 6 out of 10 i really like the look and the unique ride but they tend to squeak a bit and don't match up comfortwise especially with how picky I've become with sock fit and tongue pressure for me they're not a repeat purchase so while both have their strengths only one earns a spot in my rotation moving forward all right that's a wrap for this video if you enjoyed it go ahead and hit that like button and subscribe for more reviews like this got questions or want to share your own

VrkW9oWhObk,Adidas Superstar,hey what's going on YouTube today I got another classic shoot for you guys today this is the adidas superstar commonly known as the shell-toes this particular version is the originals version in the white and black colorway these retail for $80 but you can definitely find these cheaper than that I got these at Dick's Sporting Goods for 59.99 so a pretty good chunk off retail anyways let's get these open so there it is the infamous shell toe let's get them both out here quick background on these the superstars were originally released as a basketball shoe back in 1969 within a few years it was actually being worn by a majority of mpa players at the time it was then made more famous in the 80s when Run DMC wore them they actually signed an endorsement deal with the Diaz and it was the first time a hip-hop artist signed an endorsement deal with a large corporation so tons of history with issue moving on to the materials of the shoe of course it's got a full grain leather upper and a rubber outsole now for the features the main feature of the shoe of course is the rubber shell toe it sits very prominently at the front and well looks like a shell it's got an X pattern and it goes really well with the rest of the shoe and it also has a lot of stitching details around it moving on to the side we got the iconic three stripes with perforations for breathability and the Goldstar lettering on the tongue we have more gold on the adidas logo lining of the shoe is a nice mesh material that's also padded here at the back we got the adidas logo again on a black tab that looks really good on the outsole on the side here the rubber has a distinct pattern I really don't even know how to describe it but it's really nice looking detail which almost kind of like a camouflage but it looks really good at the bottom of the shoe we have a simple herringbone pattern so really not much going on there lastly the shoe does feature a removable insole the insole is a lightweight ortholite foam that is also a Dita's branding overall the adidas superstar is an iconic shoe with a pretty awesome history behind it it's a timeless shoe that you really can't go wrong with for under 100 bucks anyways that's pretty much all you need to know about these shoe let's get these off beat to be honest I wasn't really feeling these shoes before buying them but I knew it was a shoe I wanted to try out after putting em on though I was really digging them this shoe in my opinion looks better on feet than it does in hand they have a really round toe box shape similar to a Stan Smith but the shell toe with the black stripes really set it off these do fit true to size and we're pretty comfortable I'm afraid though that over time they will become uncomfortable just because of the lack of midsole and because the insole is really thin but only time will tell I'm gonna make these my dailies to see if that's the case anyways that's gonna be it for me make sure to LIKE and subscribe if you guys enjoyed the video as it really helps out I make videos like this one and right now I'm doing shoes that are good for the summer so stay tuned for that like always I'll see you guys in the next you,2025-06-23 14:43:40.351775 UTC
nO_4P9qtBa8,Nike Cortez,hey what's going on gang over 2 years ago I made a video about what happened to the Nike Cortez at the time they became a really hot commodity as they were unavailable in stores and on nike.com due to mainly supply chain issues because of the uh vid pandemic they were selling for crazy prices on third party resale sites for a shoe that pre-World changing event cost only $60 so for this video I wanted to take a look look at the state of the Cortez see if they're back to that privid uh State and just to see if things are back to normal availability wise on the Nike website where they were previously unavailable they are now readily available with a bit of a catch for one they no longer retail for $60 which is to be expected because of you know the inflation that's been happening so it is expected they now retail for $90 with different versions and like special colorways going for more you can also now Build A Bear your own Cortez for $120 they have a variety of colorways available and they also have a textile version of the Cortez alongside the classic leather version noticeably missing though is that classic red white and blue version that Forest Gump colorway which really sucks because that was my my favorite classic colorway of the sneaker like I said you can still build your own but it's going to cost you that $120 now what about availability in stores in the previous video I actually did hit up uh a couple places I hit up Shoe Palace Finish Line Foot Locker and a local spot named core in that video they were not available anywhere except for core for 190 plus and I went to go revisit these stores nowadays starting with Shoe Palace and I was able to find them in the Black Version and the white version as well as a this white and brown version of the shoe so they were available there and they were going for that 90 MSRP at Finish Line they were also available in a couple different color ways they had a pretty good spread next up at Foot Locker they did not have them at all and lastly at core they did have them again but only in Black Version and they only had them in size 14 and 15 for $170 which is ridiculous I was curious also to see how much they ran for on stockx the 2024 version of the Forest Gump Cortez that was released which was the one I looked at uh and retailed for $110 uh but the resale now for the popular sizes of 8 to 12 at the time of recording this video they resold between about 115 to 155 so they are still reselling for a decent amount for the that Forest Gump colorway it looks like they really made it more of a limited colorway which sucks because like I said pre viid it was one of the Mainstay colorways alongside the black and white versions which is sad in the previous video I actually had a conspiracy theory that I mentioned that Nike was trying to do what it did with the Jordan Ones and the dunks which was trying to Garden her hype for the shoe by making it super limited and I also made a prediction check it out the upcoming Union collabs and the Sakai collabs which are fire by the way Nike is definitely going to be riding out that hype train all the way to the bank I'm thinking their plan might be to discontinue the classic colorways to Hype up the collabs and the Cortez silhouette in general then when they done with the big collabs they'll drop small limited numbers of the classic colorways in between smaller collabs thus creating more demand for the shoe I could be wrong though like I said could be completely wrong now was my prediction correct pretty much you know I don't want to brag I don't want to toot my horn or anything but it was pretty correct if we take it back to 2022 with the release of the Sakai Cortez it was a pretty hyped up release but on the resale Market which is what we know is a good measure of hype it really did not do too well they retailed for $180 when they originally dropped and now many sizes are available Below Retail so if you bought this for the hype to try to resell it for to get those hype prices you you you're going to end up losing they also released the Union La collaborations which was also pretty hyped up but even those they're still available on the Nike website itself they're going for 130 bucks most sizes are gone but it's funny that they're still available and then you had smaller drops like you had some Brown version uh the light orwood brown released you had a sale version of the of the Cortez and then again another high powered drop another high powerered collaboration with clot so yeah clot ended up releasing three colorways which was the Bruce Lee colorway the yin-yang colorway and they Rel released a Forest Gump colorway now the most sought after one was a br Le that one still actually does have good resale value but the ying yangang and the Forest Gump they're way Below Retail on the resale Market they retailed for $150 and the vast majority of sizes are way below that $150 then like I said more drops in between the high powerered ones and then they finally in 2023 they released the classic black and white Cortez that had been gone for so long more kind of non- hype color waves that they released then finally February 2024 they re-released the Forest Gump color W and that one retailed for $110 so it does seem like the regular black and white ones are going to be fully available now they're keeping that Forest Gump colorway more limited so it does seem like they were trying to do that whole they were trying to give it the Jordan 1 dunk treatment by having these high powered collabs and then having them hype up all the other shoes but it really just just did not work because their collaborations just weren't hitting on the market and the market was already tapering down anyways so really it it just did not work and now it looks like they're back to trying to release all the other ones the only one they are hanging on to like I said is that Forest gum color way I hope they release more stock of it because I do want to get my hands on one of them my pair is getting kind of worn so I really hope they become more available because it is it does suck that they're keeping that one out of all of them but anyways guys let me know what you guys think let me know down below comment like subscribe do all that good stuff and I'll see you guys in the next one,2025-06-23 11:22:05.833838 UTC
kyJ5EQ33-2Y,New balance 550,hey what's going on guys today we'll be comparing the two thickies we got the new balance 550 the new thicky on the block and then we got the nike air force one the og 50. we're gonna be comparing the prices and colorways the silhouette the leather quality and lastly we'll be comparing how they both feel on feet then we're going to be answering the question which one should you buy so let's get into it starting off with the prices the regular black and white air force one retails for a hundred and ten dollars used to be ninety dollars for the longest but those days are long gone and the 550s come in at the same price 110 even however as most of us know once nike puts any type of color on the air force one the prices just tend to go up from there and they can go anywhere from 120 to 150 at that point and if it's a really special collab it can go even higher than that new balance tends to stay at that 110 dollar price tag which is nice although that one collab i'm not even gonna attempt to pronounce it this collab does go up to 130 but for the most part the new balance 550s tend to stay at about 110 to 120 i'm thinking once the 550s become more popular we're gonna start seeing more expensive colorways and more expensive collapse but right now the 550s are just not as well established as the air force ones which as we know have a ton of colorways near infinite colorways moving on to the silhouette both shoes were made with a very similar design language a chunky low top old school basketball sneaker and both shoes accomplished that really well which one looks better is really up to you the 550s have a ton of leather overlays and they even incorporated some mesh at the rear personally i really like those perforations on the side i think it really gives it that extra basketball look to it meanwhile the air force one keeps it simple it sports a really classic design that has made it popular since the 80s but while the chunky silhouettes are very similar there are a few key differences for one the air force one does tend to run about a half size big while the 550s run more true to size the 550 also has a smaller toe box than the air force one the air force one has a blockier toe box while the 550s toe box is a lot sleeker also it seems like the air force one has a more round toe box than the 550s next up the air force ones obviously have the nike air technology which for those of you who don't know is the an air pocket in the midsole while the 550s use purely eva in the midsole now i'm not 100 sure but i think that air pocket might be the reason why the air force one is just a little bit taller than the new balance 550s side by side they both seem to have the same height but if you look closer the stitch line on the air force ones is actually a little bit higher than the stitch line on the 550s now i confirmed it also by obviously feeling inside and inside you can tell that the air force ones are actually just a little bit taller than the 550s so the air force ones are gonna give you that extra little bit of height on to the leather quality the 550s leather feels pretty rough but it is also firm while the new balance is leather feels a lot smoother a lot sleeker and it's also just as firm as the 550s leather overall both shoes have really stiff nice leather which is really expected for that 110 price tag now let's talk comfort both are very comfortable on feet both feel very similar on feet as you guys can see i got both shoes on i got 550s on this one af ones on this side now i've been wearing both for a couple days now and like i said they're both very similar in comfort a couple little differences i did notice though is that the heel to toe motion on the new balance 550s does tend to feel a little bit smoother because it is a little bit shorter in length so the heel to toe motion just a little bit smoother than the air force one however the air force one because of that bigger toe box it feels roomier on the upper than the 550s and personally i prefer the comfier upper of the air force one than the 550s like i said both very comfortable shoes both great shoes but i think in terms of comfort might have to give it to the air force one but that's just my personal opinion so which ones should you guys buy honestly that's kind of a hard question to answer both shoes are really great if you've never if you haven't owned either of these shoes and you really only want to buy one of them or you only have enough money to buy one of these shoes i would have to give it to the air force one air force one is just a classic you really can't go wrong with it and it just feels like it has more heritage and history to it so if you haven't owned either of these and you're on the fence about which one to buy i would personally go with the air force one however if you do own a pair of air force ones but you just want another you want to switch it up and you want a chunky sneaker that's different from the air force one i would go with the 550s i think a lot of people who own air force ones are gonna find this shoe refreshing because it is very similar to an air force one but well it's different and i really think new balance did a really good job with this shoe so overall both shoes very similar great shoes so let me know guys down in the comments is the 550 a really good alternative to an air force one which shoe do you guys prefer do you guys prefer the 550s or the air force ones so guys that's gonna be it for the video i really hope you guys found it helpful hope you guys enjoyed it and i'll see you guys in the next one peace,2025-06-23 14:50:46.073286 UTC
b-BeHYmiNfk,Stan Smith,hey what's going on youtube today i'm gonna be giving some reasons on why i think you should cop a pair of stan smith we're also gonna be doing a review of the stan smiths that i've had for two years it's coming up on like three but yeah doing a quick little two-year review with that being said let's get the culprit out here let me take them all i have them on my shoe let me take them off so here they are i know i know they're pretty beat and i definitely abuse these look at me like that don't mind all right so now that we've gotten the uh the old boys out here let's uh let's take a look at the new yeah nice crispy adidas box brand new pair i mean there's nothing better than a brand new pair of shoes look at that difference what a difference two years makes this is me before kovit and this is me after coving you know first thing i want to talk about with these ones is pretty much the durability so the durability has surprisingly been pretty good especially after two years the upper has held up pretty well of course we got some blemishes in the front and then some scuffs around the upper but overall definitely pretty good the leather kind of has the leather on this one it's not the best i started to peel a little bit in the front and the leather has started to kind of crack by some of these holes she's also got a little bit of wrinkles you know she she's showing her age but overall not too bad onto the lining the lining is also held up pretty well normally normally especially with like canvas shoes that have like the canvas lining after you know two years at least for me anyways the lining will usually start to rip but that was it wasn't the case with these shoes so i'm really happy with that and that obviously because of the leather lining so it hasn't worn down at all same with the insert the insert has not worn down still the same old insert it's a little bit dirty but it hasn't really worn down or broken down as is the case with other shoes so overall pretty good on the inside as well on to the outsole the treading in the common areas has obviously started to fade a bit like on the heel and on the toe area the yellowing on the sole hasn't really been that severe either i've seen other people's pairs and their pair tends to yellow really really badly i'm not too sure why mine hasn't yellow that bad i mean maybe maybe it has yellow i was texting me i don't have any friends or else i wouldn't be doing this it was my mom it's time to go eat why am i housing over that maybe maybe it it has and it's just so damn very you can't tell but but overall outsole has held up pretty well let's talk about the comfort with these so with the comfort wise they really just have this insert it's this eba foam it is really thick though which is really nice i really like that and then on the bottom we just have kind of a fiber board and then a and then it's just a rubber on the bottom the comfort has been good on the shoes i really can't complain too much on the comfort even though it doesn't have any crazy midsole like a like a you know eva midsole they're still very comfortable just because that insert is so thick so yeah comfort definitely good no problems at all with comfort next reason why i think you should get a pair of stan smith it's because they're so they're just so damn versatile the shoe is versatile and then the outfits you can wear with these are versatile the shoe they come in tons of different color ways and tons of different like graphics on them you know adidas is always coming out with like a brand new different pair of sand smiths that you could buy i got the uh og colorway they're also versatile in terms of like what type of technology they use a couple years ago they released a lot of the boost version of the adidas there's ones that have the boost outsole someone had the primary upper and then they released a version that had both so really versatile in terms of like what adidas does with these shoes and what type of technology they incorporate into the shoes so yeah they do a lot of crazy things with these even some not so great things like the adidas slip-ons that just why why adidas why why did we need a stan smith slip on uh let's not talk about this same with the super stance what was up with that just absolutely horrible that shoe looks like it was built in a lab by some crazy mad scientist and you know they created a freaking frankenshoe with the super stamp and now it goes around haunting little kids who just wanted a superstar imagine being a kid who just wanted a pair of superstars and then your parents come at you they say hey little timmy here's your present little timmy opens up the box and this ungodly contraption of the super stand comes out you know how terrifying that would be those shoes are horrible on the tongue they freaking used they overlapped the logos on the tongue they freaking they painted the toe cap to make it look like you know they peeled the shell toe off they painted stripes on it it's a stan smith that's dressed up like a superstar it's just horrible i don't know why they would do that i have a theory that they just got some leftover stan smith and then maybe a couple superstars and they're like you know what you know what super stan and then they just combined the things and they just kind of painted it uh let's not talk about the shoe i went off on a crazy engine also in terms of versatility just style-wise right you can wear these with anything i like wearing mine with a pair of jeans you know they also look good in pairs of shorts of course you know on youtube you can see people wearing these with all type of outfits and they're rocking them and they look dope and because you have so many options in terms of different colors and stuff like that your options are basically limitless let's move on to the next point or the reason why i think you should copy pair the history these shoes have such a cool history like if you learn what's behind the face and what went into the design i think it's really cool and i'll give you a new appreciation on the shoe it's kind of like owning a little piece of history i'm not going to go into so much detail about the history of the shoes if you really want to dig into the history of the shoes definitely check out uh nacho average finds video on the stan smith there's a ton of other videos on the history of sneakers so definitely go check that out i'm just gonna mention some of the cool things i i found out about the history that i really liked for example like how most tennis shoes before the stan smith were really made out of canvas adidas came along and basically just added a leather upper instead of having a canvas upper and that really that was really received well by by tennis players they they really liked the support that the leather offered also with the name you know it was it was actually this shoe was originally called the robert haylett he actually was endorsing the shoe before stan smith did and then once he retired um adidas was looking for another person to kind of take up the mantle of endorsing the shoe after robert hayley retired and so that's when stan smith came along and uh yeah basically this guy has a lifetime deal with this face right here this little face right here has a lifetime deal with adidas to endorse the shoe and it's crazy because up until uh 05 it was actually a flat deal he was getting a flat fee to endorse the shoe um and then after 05 they actually negotiated royalties so literally for every pair you buy this guy adidas cuts this guy a check which is pretty awesome imagine having a lifetime deal man that's not too many people could say that so next reason is the prominence i there's tons of celebrities that have worn these and now i'm not saying that you need to buy a pair just because some celebrities or whatever what i am saying is that these shoes are pretty much appreciated by so many people they're appreciated by regular folk and celebrities alike you know and i know they're not as popular as they were before but these are just a shoe that just doesn't go out of style in my opinion this is just a widely beloved shoe both by men and women as well it's a very unisex shoe you know according to google trends as well you know these peaked around the uh 2016-2017 era you know that's when you know kanye was wearing them and everything even though they don't have that level of popularity as they did back in 2016 and 2017 these are still a timeless shoe you know you can't go wrong with these all right last reason is the price 80 bucks for these not bad if you ask me that's pretty affordable for these if you're one of those person who doesn't like spending like over 60 on a shoe or something like that just wait for the sales you know you wait for the sales usually you can get these for or if you even if you shop around you can find these for you know 60 or under usually so definitely very affordable and like i mentioned before the leather even though i'm not the biggest fan of the leather they have versions out there that are you know they're 90 to 100 and with that you're getting a lot better leather so that would actually increase the life of the shoe you know obviously the better quality leather so that is always an option available to you if you want to get a better version of the shoe it's gonna be more expensive but yeah you'll get better leather and your shoe will most likely last you longer than than the 80 pair of the originals that's pretty much gonna be it for the video we're gonna go try these on right now and i'm gonna give you guys a little montage of the shoes so you guys can kind of see what they look on feet so maybe we kind of look with different fits but i thank you guys for watching uh subscribe if you haven't already really appreciate it and i'll see you guys in the next one [Applause] is [Applause] uh earlier is you,2025-06-19 08:39:27.538637 UTC
YxxKwCe5lkY,Reebok Club C 85 Vintage shoes,hey what's going on youtube today we're going to be looking at three different versions of the club c85 we got the regular club c85 we have the club c85 vintage and then we have the club c85 tv we're going to be looking at some of the differences and then i'm going to be giving my opinion on which ones i think you should buy and the reason i'm doing this video because i feel like there's a lot of confusion surrounding like um which shoes what's the difference between all three models especially these two there seems to be a lot of confusion as to what the difference is between the vintage and the tv is because they look so similar so before we actually take a look at the differences i want to look at the boxes so the box for the regular club sees it's just your typical reebok classic box it's got the navy with the red just your typical box nothing really special about it um and then for the vintage we have the union jack because it's part of the vintage line so we got the union jack on the box and then for the tvs it's the same box actually as the vintages for me they came with the sleeve um i bought them on end clothing because unfortunately they didn't have the tvs in my size on reebok.com and they sent it to me with the sleeve i'm not sure if it comes with the sleeve directly from reebok or and clothing actually put it on themselves so you know do what you will with that info all right now let's talk about the price differences because they actually all have different price ranges regular eclipses retail at 70 the vintages retail at 75 and then the tvs retail at 90. so obviously there's going to be some differences between them all right moving on to the color of these shoes the differences anyways for the regular klepsies they come in quite a few different colorways um you have obviously this one's the white with the navy and then there's also a white with the green accents and then there's an all black one so there's a couple of different color options for the regular club c's now for the vintages they pretty much only come in the chalk paper white with the green for the men's they do have some special editions of these shoes but they're obviously they're not readily available to everyone and you can only really get them on their party sites like stockx the women are a bit luckier they actually do get um a blue version of the vintage shoes so you know good for them but other than that it's pretty much only this one for the men's in terms of color waves and then the tvs it's the same colorway as the vintage is to my knowledge there's no special edition colorway for the tvs at all it's pretty much just this colorway all right now let's talk about the leather so the leather for all three is actually different for all three of them for the um regular eclipses the leather is a lot sturdier and it feels more synthetic-y but it's not like it's not a bad leather it's a pretty decent leather i i like the leather but like i said it's stiff and it feels a lot more plasticky and then once we get to the vintages the leather is buttery smooth but it creases very very easily but it is a nice leather and then lastly we do have the tvs now obviously it's genuine leather you even get a little charm that tells you it says the little charm says the original garment leather athletic shoes so very very nice um but you are paying a higher price and the reason for the higher price is pretty much the leather leather does feel better than the leather on the vintages i wouldn't say it feels like amazingly better um it obviously still creases pretty easily not as easily as the vintages but the tvs do crease obviously it's and the leather is still very soft all right so now we're going to get into some of the little minor differences between the shoes i'm only really going to compare these two from now on just because the tvs and the vintages are almost identical except for the leather really and also because the my vintages are they're pretty dirty so when they're using these are brand new so for the lining on the tvs you get this terry cloth lining that feels really really nice and it feels almost like a towel like material and then for the uh regular club sees you know it's not a towel-like material it's just it's it's a soft material it's pretty much just a regular cloth on the vintages and the tvs you actually get a reebok stamp on the regular club season you don't get anything i'm sorry if you guys can hear the uh lawnmower in the background um i never decided to cut his grass right now so or no it's not a llama it's a blower he decided to blow his yard so um you guys can hear it my bad also the reebok stamps on the back are a little bit different it's kind of hard to tell the differences but they are a little different same with the stamps on the side the reebok logos are a little bit different so i mentioned the lining so the lining in here you it's just a plain lining i'll show you guys in the b-roll but on the lining for the vintages and the tvs you get you know you get a little more detail you get some nice reebok all over print which looks really cool so the tvs and the vintages feel a lot lighter than the regular ones there's a pretty significant difference between the weight also i noticed that the on the vintages and tvs you get an exposed eva but on the regular ones you don't get such a thing it's just straight rubber and also worth mentioning profiles the silhouettes are a little bit different this one has a lower the tvs and the vintages have a little bit lower profile than the regular ones insoles are a little bit different when you compare the tvs and the vintages and then just the regular eclipses they have the same gray eva insole but on the vintages and tvs you get this extra little yellow padding on it so it's a little bit more cushioning than your regular ones um but it's nothing too significant however what was significant and what i found out is i remember trying both of these on and i remember them feeling a little bit different and i was like wow you know like the eva be hitting a little bit different on these it feels a little stiffer in reality is that these have no eva midsole like none at all the rubber i thought it was just i thought the rubber was just covering the eva when in reality there's just no rubber found out when i was comparing the phone the insoles i cut my shoe a little bit i'll show you guys the b-roll but i basically cut this little lining on the bottom to kind of reveal what was under it and under it it's just straight rubber that's it you don't you don't get anything else there's no eva midsole or anything so that pretty much explains why these feel heavier than these ones and why just the regular eclipses they they have this rubber basically so it all started to make sense which is kind of disappointing i really thought they were pretty much all the same except for you know slight differences between like the leather and stuff like that which means objectively that these two are going to be more comfortable so yeah there's that which brings me into my next segway comfort so the regular eclipses you know they're comfortable you know just because they don't have the eva midsole doesn't mean they're oh they're going to be uncomfortable now they're still comfortable they have a very thick insole so it's comfortable and the rubber on the bottom isn't like this super hard rock rubber it's a it's a little bit of a soft rubber and the leather on the toe cap um because the leather is thicker on these ones on your toe they're gonna feel a little bit stiffer so these shoes overall are stiffer they're just a little more sturdier and then when you compare the these two the tvs and the vintages it's just more comfortable just because you have that eva midsole you got the extra little padding on top of the top of the insole and then because the leather is so soft it feels really nice on the toes it doesn't feel like this hard shell when you compare it to just the regular eclipse so objectively these are more comfortable these two versions anyways are going to be more comfortable than the regular reebok club sees all right now on to which one i think you should buy i would buy the regular club c's if you're just looking for more uh color options or if you just don't like this colorway because like i said for these ones you're pretty much only limited to this colorway so for these ones there's a whole lot more color options and they're a little bit cheaper than both of these i mean it's only five bucks cheaper than this one like i said more color options and they're a little bit cheaper just because they don't have the eva midsole doesn't mean they're going to be super uncomfortable or anything like i said they're still going to be very very comfortable and just a just a great shoe overall all right now for the vintages you know obviously if you really care about comfort you should probably get one of these too or if you really also just like the colorway you know this colorway isn't available in this version of the shoe it's literally only limited to the vintage and tvs so if you like the colorway of the shoe you like that old-school look to it definitely recommend this one prefer the klepsie 85 tv um this one i wouldn't really recommend it to a whole lot of people i would only really recommend it if you're that type of person who just really really likes to have that genuine leather shoe you know you really you really you have to have that you know good leather because the leather like i said it is better than the vintages but i don't know if you know it's worth paying 90 or 15 extra dollars when the leather feels a little bit better really it's up to you if you can if you don't mind paying 90 bucks for a little bit better leather for the same shoe then go for it but other than that i think most people they had to choose between this these two they would mostly pick the vintages just because they're gonna be they're gonna be cheaper these are 75 these are 90. that's pretty much it for the video for the differences and everything i hope you guys found that very helpful let me know if you guys have any um suggestions on what other shoes i should compare and do the differences on but other than that guys like and subscribe if you guys enjoyed it and see you guys in the next video peace there goes the blower,2025-06-19 08:38:07.895925 UTC
DmATPIyCoE0,Nike Cortez,hey what's happening y'all it's your old pal Mr butter coming back at you again today I want to take a look at a pair of kicks that is an absolute classic these also shared a special Spotlight in one of my favorite movies of all time if you you're ear in the kicks and you feel like hanging out then hit that subscribe button let's take a look at these Forest Gump Nike Cortez as I mentioned in the intro this pair was featured in one of the greatest movies of all time in my opinion I was in high school whenever Forest Gump came out I actually liked it so much that I went to see it twice in the movie theaters whenever it came out the soundtrack was absolutely goated back at that time and also Tom Hanks just did an amazing job portraying the character fors Gump it wasn't a new silhouette during that movie or anything like that but there was a scene where Jenny bought him a new pair of shoes and he really liked them and that is this colorway that we'll see here they come in a standard Nike box it's orangish red like we always get Nike branding on it nothing really to review there the tag reads Nike Cortez the colors are white white Varsity Red and Varsity Blue I went with my true to size a size 10 in this pair hello what the heck was that did Jenny get you those shoes what these no I bought them and who's Jenny never mind about that who are you my name is butter Gump you could call me butter Gump your dog had to go poo poo hello dog well those look like comfortable shoes you are wearing what these shoes that I'm wearing these are the fire red fours they're not comfortable my feet hurt oh okay well then I will go running go okay man catch you later all right y'all sorry about that Interruption I have never seen that guy around here before but anyhow here they are these things just have a classic look and honestly the fact that they were in a movie that I love so much that makes me love them even more the Cortez doesn't get as much attention I don't know if it's like an East Coast thing or a West Coast thing but I think they're way more popular out west I really don't see many people wearing these in my area but that kind of makes me like them even more just because even though this is a silhouette that has been around forever it's just unique to me because it's not the same thing that I see it's not a dunk it's not a Jordan but it still has a very very classic style to it I did read that Nike was trying to make this pair as close to the original as they possibly could I did notice that the shape on these seems a little bit different and I don't know if that's closer to the original shape but I was thinking whenever I got these shoes before in the front it was more of a gradual slope on its way up and these things are actually really really boxy I'm not sure if you can tell there in the front but the shape of these in the front is actually really really boxy I will say that with my first look at these and my first impression I think that the quality control on this pair is actually really really good mama always said that Noy quality control is like a box of chocolates you never know what you're going to get I really don't think that your mom has ever said that do you have any Dr Peppa no sorry I don't have any Dr Pepper I will go find Lieutenant Dan he don't have no legs as you can see it's a pretty classic style it's a very simple design it's all just a pretty synthetic feeling leather on the upper it's got a white base and then of course that really allows that blue and that Varsity Red to pop off of there looking at the out soole it's got a pretty classic looking traction pattern it's got Nike braining there at the midfoot and it's all white on the out soole then as we come up to the midsole it's white but then we have that nice pop of blue in there and I think it looks really clean coming to the upper it does just feel like it's a pretty synthetic leather and in my opinion it does have a boxier shape at the tow than other Cortez models that I've had whether or not that's more true to the original I'm not sure but I do think that these red overlays for the swooshes it does look like it's a really nice big swoosh and I like that because I know that's more of the classic Runner style that Nike had back in the day we also have a nice red overlay with some Nike branding there on the heel I've always liked the zigzag that we have on the edge of this overlay that goes up the ice stays and I kind of think it even ties in the zigzags that we have at the edge of the outo as well for the traction but I just think that's always been a unique design element of these shoes but really all the leather aside from the red overlays is just bright white and as I said it does feel pretty synthetic but I think these were like 90 bucks or something like that they were very affordable and Nike just released these again so they're sitting most places I'll put an affiliate link down here if you're interested in grabbing them but I like it when you can get a shoe that has such classic style and you don't have to break the bank for it the tongue feels kind of comparable to like dunk tongues or Jordan one tongues it's just like a Nyon material but that's a white color and then the piping along the edges of that is white and we have a white tag with some red Nike branding there at the top these came with just flat bright white laces it didn't come with any spares but I can't imagine putting anything different in these anyhow we have a white sock liner and that does kind of remind you of the sock liners that we saw back in the day and then we have a blue insole with some white Nike branding on it all right well that was a pretty quick look at these things I love them I like the classic design I like the classic style and these things really do hold a special place in my heart just because I love that movie so much when whenever I was younger and like I said I went to see it twice in the movie theaters whenever I was in high school so this just kind of takes me back to that and reminds me of that and I'm a sucker for Nostalgia I apologize for all those interruptions it looks like he's finally gone now but let me know what you all think about these and I hope you all have a wonderful Halloween I'm out I sure wish this wind would stop so I could finish my SE do you have any chocolate maybe a dock of pepper I'll take that as a no,2025-06-23 11:22:10.613167 UTC
eMGIciKbz6g,Air Jordan 1,hey what's up Zach here and if you've seen the last dance on Netflix I'm sure you caught the sneaker episode where Michael Jordan was talking about his feet being soaked in Blood and absolutely killing him after wearing the Jordan 1 for his last game at Madison Square Garden back in 1998 years after its initial release and also after a season of wearing the Jordan 13 but if the Jordan 1 was good enough for Jordan years earlier in the 80s and it's arguably one of the most worn sneakers on the Planet why did they tear his feet up so bad the last time he wore them in a game and is the Jordan one dangerous for you to wear let's find out now to answer this you first have to look at what both the Jordan one and the Jordan 13 are made of and what their performance characteristics are I mean there's no point in denying that Jordan 1 was a real turning point for sneakers and for its time in 1985 they were a real head turning design with a more up midsole really strong upper overlays made of that action leather which is really just cow leather with a polyurethane coating not to mention the famous Jordan 1 out Souls with that Bullseye Traction in the forefoot as well as all this compartmentalized rubber in the heel and there's also plenty of video evidence of Michael Jordan absolutely destroying defenders in these shoes when they were his regular game day shoe but fast forward in 1998 when Michael Jordan was playing in the Jordan 13s for the bulk of that season and after 13 years you know they featured a lot more forgiving materials in the midfoot and especially the uppers with more soft Leathers more textile fibers and in the midsole you had two Zoom airbags plus just the midsole that was a lot more ergonomic it just fit the bottom of the foot a little bit better so it cradled the arch exponentially better than a flat rubberized midsole which obviously offered less than optimal shock absorption when talking about the Jordan 1es and you know the outsole on the 13s is actually a personal favorite of mine now it's modeled after a Black Panther's paw and these have exceptional lateral stability but they're also solid as a rock and how they cradle What's called the gabrius junction of your foot now what is that the gabrius junction of your foot is where the bottom of your foot in the top of your foot meet where the skin meets and you can actually tell exactly where that is because the skin on the bottom of your foot is going to look a lot different than the top and that equator of your foot is also where the shoe is going to have the maximum potential to stabilize your foot going side to side and the Jordan 13s do this better than actually a lot of modern day shoes do and when you put these two sneakers head-to-head on court looking at their speed on the suicide test the Jordan 13s came in at 14.90 seconds and and really did their best work when cornering with that mid and out soole just made perfectly for grabbing the court when the foot was off center now versus the Jordan one that came in at 15.76% how the shoe made me work for that time because when you look inside the Jordan 1es they're almost a flat sole Without Really any wide lateral flange or any Dynamic elements to really redistribute the weight so each stride induces much more shock into the foot and leg versus on the 13s Plus on turns the foot is kind of allowed to slide back and forth within the shoe on the insole or the strobo board so there's more friction and heat buildt up with each cut pivot or turn however when looking at just the traction both on an asphalt or concrete and a hardwood Court the Jordan one's traction holds up just uncommonly well even against brand new outsole designs designed with AI and loads of player data it just really goes to show you that sometimes a good design can hold up over a long period of time and if you're a fan of Jordan brand or just a sneaker head in general I'm sure you realized I did that suicide test on a clear rubber outsole on the Jordan 1 and as a lot of us know it clear rubber does not grip as well on asphalt or concrete as a dyed Rubber outsole and I was still getting really terrific grip even on this clear rubber outsole so it just shows you just how well the Jordan 1's outsole was designed even on the more slick outsole tread it's still grabbing around those corners but I think is even more interesting than the grip of the Jordan 1es is how that grip almost Dooms the shoe because when you're stopping on the court the Jordan one is grabbing really well however it's not grabbing your foot inside the shoe that well so all that inertia and body weight even even though the shoe is stopped is still moving within the shoe so the grip of the Jordan 1es and how great it is also really accentuates how bad the shoe is for holding you inside the shoe but I think my favorite part of the performance comparison of these shoes was a jump height test and now when I compared both models jump height scores the Jordan 13s gave me 34 cm of jump height on average which I really thought was pretty remarkable given how old the shoe is however what was more impressive to me was the Jordan 1's jump pight scores which I got 27 CM on average of jump height which is better than some new shoes I've tested recently and for me the key factors in both these shoes jump height scores came down to their respective midsoles the Jordan 13 just has a much more ballistic type midsole it's also a lot more ergonomic remember it has the carbon fiber shank and zoom airbags on both sides of it plus that midsole is much more cradling to those really large Arch muscles so the shoes just easier to get up off the ground plus it gives you a little bit of a spring board effect from the carbon fiber and on the Jordan 1's kind of an opposite effect remember the midsole and the Jordan 1's a little more rubberized and just gives them a little bit more pop versus shoes nowadays with more standard Eva or etpu midsoles but once again the problem in the Jordan 1's comes down to what happens when you land from that jump on the 13s the midsole foam and the air disperse that Force into the shoe whereas on the ones once again they force your foot muscles to make up that difference in shock absorption I think one of the the biggest differences between the ones and the 13s that really goes into the radar and has a ton to do with how much the foot is allowed to slip back and forth in the shoe is just how much stiffer and more resilient the 13's heel counter is this little plastic piece that goes up here that controls your heel motion whereas on the ones I mean I cut right through it it's just made a really flimsy material and on the 13s it's really stiff so it's holding that foot and it's holding that healing and honestly that more than anything brings me to why Michael Jordan's feet were soaked in blood all of these factors all increase friction and heat within the shoe and when you're playing pro basketball they will lead to your skin breaking down pretty quick from abrasions and blistering even though Michael Jordan had a really great game that night it was Michael Jordan's body that was making up for all these performance metrics versus when he was playing in the 13s when they were just doing a lot of that work for him and that's also the reason his feet were fine in the Jordan 1es a decade before and writhing in them 13 years later your body just gets used to what's around it same reason a carpenter's hand gets blistered the first time they use a hammer for an extended period and after their skin adapts it's no big deal and in Jordan's case he built up all that skin tolerance and muscles in his foot only presented with much more plush options later down the road as new Jordan shoes came down the line and then once he got adapted to those all of a sudden you throw the Jordan Ones in the mix during a really high level of play and that cycle just has to start all over again and your body being 13 years older well that's really hard transition to make over just one game but so to answer the question are the Jordan 1es dangerous for you to play in if they were able to do that to Michael Jordan's foot one of the greatest of all time well no I mean your foot's going to get used to whatever you put it in and remember his foot being soaked in blood I mean that can happen with just a big blister so you know sometimes you know Netflix with these documentaries they're they're trying to Hype it up a little bit and they're trying to get you to click and watch longer so just because his foot was soaked in blood doesn't mean you know the shoe was literally tearing his foot from his ankle but I do think if you're used to playing in shoes like the Jordan 13 or shoes that have just come out this year remember you're going to be used to that plush feeling under foot you're going to be used to the stack under your foot and when you go to a shoe that pretty much has none in the forefoot you know your body is not going to like that for a little while it's the same reason why you can't just start barefoot running a marathon right away if you've been using maximalist type Hoka running shoes remember your foot just has to get used to whatever it's in slowly and remember there are some people that just do not do well with low stacked shoes and there are people that do just fine with them so it really is on a caseby Case basis however if you are somebody that is used to the modern-day basketball shoe it's probably better off that you stay with that modern-day basketball shoe because while your body is trying to adjust to it you could be leaving yourself susceptible to stress fractures btis or even really bad bad skin issues like blistering or abrasions and also there are ways to make the Jordan 1 feel like a more modern-day shoe and that usually comes down to putting an orthotic in the shoe whether it be over- the- counter or custom now if you are interested in custom orthotics and kind of don't know where to start I do have a four-page digital download with my favorite builds for orthotics for certain foot types as well as people of different weights and measures of their foot so if you want to check that out that is down in the description for download but you know I think one of the biggest points that got driven home to me when I was making this video is that sometimes newer isn't always better I mean especially in the case of the Jordan 13 I mean honestly this shoe is a lot better than a lot of modern-day basketball shoes that I've reviewed this year and honestly the design of it is pretty simple I mean the design of the outsole is designed after a panther paw you know just something you find in nature it's just a simple Herring bone design and it's a really ergonomic midsole it just mimics the shape of the bottom of the foot and with a lot of these other shoes now they're made with more player data and force plate analysis and they're using AI to design the outsole I mean sometimes I think this kind of gets more to analysis to paralysis they're just trying to find a solution to a problem that doesn't exist you know in 1998 they figured this out and they found a pretty darn good design that holds up just as well today but you know honestly I'd love to hear from you do you ever find yourself playing competitively in the Jordan 1 and you know what's your experience been with them and you know if not the Jordan one then what's your favorite Jordan shoe to play in let me know in the comments down below and you know like Jordan said in that episode of The Last Dance there's been a lot of innovation in shoe technology from the 1 to the 13 so if you want to see all the innovation in technology from the 13 to the 36 make sure you click on this video up above and subscribe down below respect Rubber and foam and action leather I'll see you in the next video,2025-06-19

zbwC56lJOuc,Adidas Superstar,hey what's up guys today I'm going to share with you guys my thoughts on this Adidas Superstar tool and I will do a little bit comparison between the Adidas original Superstar and this [Applause] model I bet I trying to push the Superstar model back to the market after the cool off of the Adidas Samba you will see Adidas will use this model for their collaboration in the near future much more than just the collaboration with Fel or clar uh in my opinion this model won't do as well as the Adidas Samba even though the rubber shelto is a hero detail of the show it's been shaving our culture for last decades however it's also the detail that throw up a lot of people some say is a little bit too stiff some say is a little bit junky in the toll shape area but to me my love with the Adida Superstar is really begin in my junior high year I were trying to looking for a white sneaker that I can afford and also stay away from the Nike Air Force One that's what my friend around me often wear during that time so that's when I found the Superstar model in B viim in Fifth Avenue Brooklyn New York it's was very affordable I only paid like $45 or $50 for my first pair and this colorway is also the colorway that I bought my first pair of Adidas superstar in white and black stripe the Superstar is so iconic in this color ways ever since my first I did a superstar as an adult I'm still collecting Superstar type of show from the Adidas original to the special collaboration ones the first one I will share with you is this Adidas Superstar without three stripe in hairy s leather very nice it look premium I think the retail wor 120 or something but I got it for very cheap 6 $5 is worth on sale on this love that insole in Gold colors and the collaboration between Rick Owens and Adidas during that time the thigh high or sock like type of show Rick Owens really popular that style so he make another version in the collaboration between his brand and Adidas they create this show in the Superstar rubber shell to toolings the outo is a little bit different it's more aggressive in short T unlike the original ID Super Store it's just a regular less aggressive hering bones patterns and the rubber shelter on this collaboration model is slimmer compared it to your regular Adidas Superstore the last shoes in my collection that I want to share with you guys is another collaboration between Rick Owens and Adida the master D this one I own two pair I sold one in black colorways I think it's a trendy model right now I guess because everybody love chunky type of show in the Superstar right and you see the recent collaboration between forel and Adidas that's is a little bit chunky too but this one is the m master of that one right very nice shoes very comfortable the thing is is quite heavy look at this tooling is so damn thick right even the rubber shell to but this junky rubber shell to is matched with Rick Owen aesthetic so those are my superar style collection that I have in my closet through are so many many years finally Adidas released the Adidas Superstar to it's more comfortable than the original Adida super star that I have here on my hand because they have more paddings around the collar and as the tongue and one of the key point that make the shoes very comfortable is the rer shell toe on the Adida Superstar too they are slightly thinner and if you focus on the edge of the rubber shelter they are smoother as well that area right there the gap between the upper material and the rubber shelter that's where I got discomfort and it take me couple weeks to break it in on the original Adidas Superstore at the front you can see this the original Adidas Superstar they had more like a three stripe detail unlike the Adidas Superstar too they have only two strip and the synthetic material that are used on the Adidas Super Store to they are softer as well so with this combinations you will feel very flexible lacing system they use thicker laces on the Adidas Superstar tool and when you focus on the quarter where the three stripe at you see that perforated hold they have four instead of five right you can compare it side byze and the stitching closer to the counter is more routed the original Superstar is more pointy and at the back of the Hue counter the mustage panel they are slightly different I don't know if my is defect but on the Adidas super star the mustach panel they are a symmetrical you can see in the medial size and in the lateral side they have different thickness now let's get a closer up into the tooling on these two shoes comparisons they basically have the same constructions but the Adida Superstar 2 they are slightly thicker not much I think it's like 2 3 mm in height and the comparison on the outo tool Lings the patterns they are the same but the Superstar to they have engrave Adidas branding logo at the age of the Hue I think that is very a good touch on the detail sizing why I would recommend you just go for Chu side the whip on this Superstar too is slightly wider so that mean give me a better fitting on my y feet the more I get in depth into this Adidas original Superstar and the Superstar 2o is kind of remind me another video that I creat the comparison between the Adidas Samba and the Adidas XL overall the Adidas Superstar to is a much try out shoes in the 2025 maybe even 2026 the shoes got a lot of improvements from the comfort to the detail compared to the original Adida Superstar styling with this shoes super easy everybody can rock with everything will look good with this beauty you don't need to be stylish or in fashion to know how to style with this ad Superstar too and up next I'm going to share with you guys how I would like to style them what so there you have it what you think about my Superstar collections that I share with you guys in the beginning of this video and if you guys haven't watched the video comparison between Adidas Samba and Adidas Samba XL I'm going to leave the link in the description box below they are very similar bro the Improvement and the detail are very similar on this comparison video and if you like one of the look in this video give me a thumb up and subscribe to my channel for more video I have a lot of video coming up every single week and I can wait to share with you guys I'm out,2025-06-23 14:43:38.768129 UTC
7ZpVDbdAplg,Vans Old Skool,hey what's up this is angry here for this video we take a look at a new little collab in the form of vans and The North Face coming together for a little capsule collection so some of these things are North Face products with a kind of vans emblem logo thing and the other half which is arguably the more exciting half our vans shoes with North Face branding and some of their technical features so I took the liberty of picking up these old schools probably the most classic vans silhouette these came in white as you can see here as long as that I picked up there was a yellow version of these and they also did skate highs in both black and red so first of all I'm gonna take a little look at the visual aspect of these and then move on to what exactly did the North Face include technical features wise to make these a little bit better than your average bands chances are if you've been into a shoe shop or browsed for sneakers at any point in your life and you will have come across this silhouette before so it really does need no introduction but what kind of interesting of visual things have we got going on with this shoe specifically well you'll notice on the sidewalls here there's this kind of suede esque material which is a little bit nicer than what you might find on your average pair of vans the kind of cheaper normal ones they tend to be a canvas material whereas this bit on the side is a little bit more plush on the back and on the toe cap there's a different material which is kind of vaguely similar to the Presto utility you'll also find this material used up along the sides of the laces and underneath the laces it goes back to a more soft suede type material those little waves on the side as well are made of a kind of plastic e type thing there are different material to the toe cap on the back rounding off this clean looking shoe towards the back is a big North Face stamp so that everyone knows you've bought something that's a little bit different T average pair of fans this particular colorway is very very clean looking you've got a crisp white and black working together here which i think looks really really nice one thing to note though is that the suede material is not actually pure white it kind of does look white in some of the product photos but it's really more of a light gray color so that is a little bit of contrast between those white toe caps and most of the side panel which is this slightly gray suede so that gives it a little bit more of interest compared to your average pair of white vans which would be totally white all over but the thing is with these is that your average pair of vans costs maybe 55 pounds these retailed much higher at 95 pounds which is a pretty significant difference to be honest so I don't think looks are enough to warrant this extra price so what exactly are vans on the North Face doing to help justify that well luckily there are quite a few nifty little features in this which do help justify that cost first of all you'll notice two outsole on these is much thicker and much more durable than your standard waffle grip vans I already mentioned the different material on the toe cap and on the back of the shoe and in fact compare that material to the Presto utilities and that is because these sections are very much water resistant I did a quick test with these to check the water repellency so I poured a bit of water over the toe cap section over the suede and over this part underneath the laces as well and although it did seem like the water repelled over the toe cap quite nicely and perhaps the suede also has been treated with some kind of water repellent coating as it seemed like the water beaded off there quite quickly as well but water does go through in this part here underneath the laces so it doesn't really offer proper protection from rain but you will definitely get some kind of resistance so if you're walking you know it's a little bit wet out there a bit of puddle and stuff then you won't suffer as much in these as in a regular pair of vans however do still be warned they don't have that water repellency of something like a presto utility the differences of these aren't just on the outside but inside is a lot plusher and a bit thicker than your average para vans and I found this made a really big difference comfort wise I'm not a massive fan of vans really in terms of comfort at all but these were significantly more wearable they just felt a little bit snugger on my feet and a little bit less kind of harsh when wearing them another thing that vans mentioned with this shoe is that there is a heat retaining layer so basically you've got on the inside this plush material on the outside you've got the sway and you've got the toe cap but in between those two layers is what I presume is a kind of foil type thing and that's gonna help insulate your foot a little bit better so these will be warmer than your average para vans and indeed when I was wearing these around the house they did definitely feel quite warm I have to admit that when these were a noun and when I ordered them I was actually expecting to not really like them just based on my experience with previous bands I don't wear them that much because I don't find them very comfortable however I really was pleasantly surprised with these they feel much more comfortable to wear they're still not on par with a lot of the other things that I've reviewed on this channel and I'd say they're probably not quite as comfortable as oppressed a utility however they're definitely much better than an average pair of hands so if you've been burned by vans before but you want to give them another go and this is exactly the kind of thing that you could perhaps consider jumping in with I also like that they've actually included some technology to elevate this shoe over and above your average pair of vans they could have easily just stuck a North Face logo on the back and called it a day however as I say they've got that extra comfort they've got that foil layer for warmth you've got these little water-resistant sections okay in practice perhaps these aren't as useful as they could be because water does still come in I think it's gonna give you better protection than a normal pair of vans and I feel like your average vans wearer is probably gonna appreciate having that little bit extra than just no water resistance at all although I'm not wild on the North Face logo being on the back and being quite prominent and quite large I don't think it's a bad inclusion and it certainly works well with this colorway which is very sort of clean and quite crisp looking it's just it's nice to have another bit of contrast sitting now on the back tee so I'm not too mad about that one so is it worth it is it worth spending that extra money to get a North Face pair of vans over a regular pair of vans you want them both next to each other which ones are you gonna buy if it was me personally I would go for the North Face ones because as I say that comfort definitely does make a big difference to me I'm gonna be more likely to wear these than I would a normal pair of vans and I do think there's value in the durable solve the extra warmth that waterproofing maybe it's not in practice gonna be that effective but at least it will give you something but your mileage may vary a bit on this one if you don't find a regular vans that uncomfortable and you're perfectly happy wearing them and you don't really think that it gets cold enough where you live or your feet just don't really feel the cold as much and you're probably not gonna benefit from the North Face ones that much and I probably wouldn't spend the extra money how do these old schools specifically though fit into tech wear well I think with an all-black fit these a little bit too garish to work them in there they really are quite white there's a lot of white on them as you can see with little black accents so I think if you're wearing sort of like full tech ninja gear and then you have these I think they're gonna stand out a little bit however if you've got something on your upper half which is white you go like white jacket black cargos and then these I think that could be quite a nice little color-block sort of thing I think mixing black and white in the rest of your outfit is definitely the way to go with these and because they are vans I think you have a lot of flexibility with other sorts of things you can wear you can get away with quite like tech and injury type things but also these are going to be fine in a much more casual look I'm not going to look out of place like for example a presto utility or the acronym Presto's would my main criticism of these though apart from the waterproofing perhaps not being as effective as it could be is what they didn't do for example why did they not make a black version of the whole school that would be perfect look much better and be even more flexible and kind of tech wear and general wearing fits and why did they not make a slip on at all a slip on version of these with that waterproof material all the way over that would just be perfect you can even do something weird but the North Face logo and like have it stretched over both issues and do it like a turtle or something that would be really really cool so I'm a bit upset that they didn't do that however I do still think that this is a cool collab and that's all I really have to say about those once I got them in hand and tried them on and stuff my opinion of them definitely became more positive and I would be more likely to recommend them I think having actually owned these for a little bit of time but do let me know what you think about them if you like this look if you think the features and the functionality are worth that extra cost or whether you think don't waste your money just get a cheap pair and then you know if they get whatever just wear them anyway and then replace them when they wear out I'd be really interested to hear what you guys think about these ones I know they're not the most tech and injuries shoe in the world but they do still have some cool features and cool performance that I think is worth talking about and in general they're quite an interesting little release as always of course if you'd enjoy the video do remember to give it a little like I super appreciate it and that's everything so thank you so much for watching and I will catch you guys in the next video shoutout to the sarchie James who gave loads of information about Kevin sizing on the last video he clearly has a lot more experience with Brandon ID he owns over 30 pieces he said so definitely take his advice especially if you're buying older camp stuff because it seems like the sizing does vary from year to year and shout-out to Alexis for mentioning the rather than worthy nike air foot skate mid utility DM if they come out UK retailer I'm definitely gonna pick some up because they look super cool definitely worth a review and worth talking about I think and in fact shout-out to everyone who has commented recently there's been like a little bit of discussion and people talking back and forth amongst themselves in the comments which i think is really nice to see and it's cool that you guys are keen to get involved and like to talk about all this tech my stuff because I'm really interested in it and I'm glad of course that you guys are as well enough for sentimentality and let's talk about some business if you want to watch some more videos those of course will be going up there and if you haven't subscribed yet but you've got all the way to the end of this video you evidently liked it

pePwgAOt7M8,Adidas Superstar,hey y'all it's meredith today we are going to be talking about the battle of the adidas two pairs come in only one can come out so today we are going to be talking about the adidas superstars versus the adidas grand courts what are the difference how do they fit and which ones do i prefer first of all let's talk about some differences between the two pairs so these are the superstars and these are the grand courts one of the major differences between these two shoes are the toes so the superstars have a hard shell sole and the grand court it's soft you can hear it squishy so that is one of the major differences another difference is the grand quartz are not made out of leather the adidas superstars do have leather and a harder sole another difference is the profile the superstars have a bit of a lower profile the tongue is a little lower and the grand court is a little higher the big difference is the grand courts have cloud foam the superstars do not what's cloud foam honestly i don't know but it's basically like spy kids technology that makes it feel like your feet are walking on clouds it really hugs the sole of your foot gives it a little more cushion really great if you have feed problems first up the superstars now i have had my adidas superstars forever i have had them for years and they definitely hold up and i think that hard soul definitely has a lot to do with it you're not going to get a lot of rips and tears on the top which i do appreciate they fit well you don't need to break them in i will say the sizing on the superstars can be a little tricky a lot of people say to size half a size down i did not do that and i kind of wish i did because they almost feel like they're made for a wider foot for reference i am an eight just a regular foot not narrow not wide just regular and these almost feel like they're made for a wider foot i will say that and when i broke my toe and needed more room these were actually a great shoe i do wish in hindsight though that i had ordered these half a size down i originally bought these shoes because i love my superstars so much that i figured why not try another kind of adidas and i also wanted a different pair in my closet because i obviously have the original black ones and i want something with a little add a little spice so i got the grand quartz with the leopard print which i really love because it just gives like a little something something like my jersey has a place to live but it's not like snooky you know what i mean i ordered these in my normal size eight because it was recommended to go true to size and i'm glad that i did because these really feel like they're made for my foot and maybe these are just a better fit for a regular sized foot versus the superstars or maybe if i order the superstars in the size half a size down as people had suggested they would have fit better but these grand courts just they feel like a hug for your foot the cloud foam is so soft on the inside and so nice when you walk you just feel that extra support it's like having when your mattress has that like top layer you add that like layer for a little extra softness like there's still support but it's a little soft i actually wore these all around boston instead of taking my adidas superstars because these are just so comfortable and i feel like with the the leopard print they actually kind of go with more if i'm wearing brown if i'm wearing black i feel like it works with anything i just i love them um i even like the the soft top i i don't really have a preference between the two of them uh the softer the hard shell but i do love how soft and cozy it is and they're just it's a lovely shoe so which are my favorite pair drum roll please and my favorite pair are the adidas grand court i was shocked that i prefer these to my original superstars because i love my superstars even though they're a little big i love them they're comfortable i wear them everywhere it's a great everyday shoe but what puts the grand court over the top for me is that cloud foam and the fact that they actually fit true to size it really feels like it's made for just a regular sized foot and that's my feet they're just regular i absolutely love the cloud foam it's so comfortable it made such a difference walking around boston and i put in some serious miles on my trip to boston and these shoes totally held up they felt great my feet did not ache at the end of the day great decision so while i do love my superstars the grand court takes the cake,2025-06-23 14:43:36.265681 UTC
R_3CUyW1pDw,Veja Esplar,hey y'all this is alex with kick therapy our goal is to reach black men by telling stories of healing through sneaker reviews i'm glad you guys are here i decided to do this review at my elementary school just to give you a history of who i am but before we jump into all that let's get into these phases this is the vega explorer vegas is a french footwear and accessory brand that focuses on making shoes out of ecological materials using wild rubber from the amazon organic cotton veg tan leather if this is what you're into this is definitely a brand to look at the way i review i'm looking for quality comfort and functionality so let's start with quality and jump into these materials the quality is great for the 120 retail i found it for 62 a couple months back but with international shipping it still ran me about 90 still under retailing is still a good price i was looking for it to be extremely stiff but i was very surprised by its mobility now it wasn't as supple as tumble leather but it didn't have those 10 wear break-in periods where you got blisters all over your feet now you're gonna have to break it in maybe two or three wears but your feet aren't going to be extremely uncomfortable and hurting which leads me right to comfort now i might be cheating a little bit i wear orthotics in all of my shoes but look man i'm flat-footed you see my ankles i'm over 200 pounds i need extra support i thought it was going to be a really rough ride with the rubber outsole but it wasn't the only way i can describe it is that it cut my foot and it made me feel safe i love how clean this silhouette and colorway are you see the off-white midsole with the white upper rubber vase of v and the heel cap all in bordeaux it's just super clean also the outsole curves up a little bit in the front so it makes the stride a little bit more natural now the tongue is a little thin it kind of folds into my ankle a little bit i can attribute that to having larger ankles but it is kind of flimsy the major v on the sides have a little shine to it because it's a rubber it's not a crazy jordan 11 patent leather situation but it has a little shine overall they're a great lifestyle shoe if you're looking for something clean to throw on with some chinos or dress pants or something like that even some shorts it has a little bit of flair not everybody's wearing it try vasia now it's really fitting to have my elementary school at the start of the series because this is where i first encountered the mental health system this is where i learned that i simply learned differently than other kids i was disruptive disinterested in my schoolwork easily distracted and like every other kid in the mid-90s that had those same symptoms or behaviors i was diagnosed with add my mom took me everywhere to try to find help neurologists counselors other specialists and during that time i took every medication ritalin stratera adderall nothing was really fixed they just saw a perceived learning disability and behavioral issues you know what's funny seeing all of those counselors and talking to all of those specialists no one asked me how my home life was no one asked me if i ever been touched inappropriately no one asked me if i felt emotionally safe with my family no one put together that my parents yelling at each other last night had a direct correlation with me yelling at my teacher the next morning they just all perceived learning disability and behavioral issues that needed to be sedated i eventually dropped out in ninth grade giving up on the system all together and trying my hand at entrepreneurship guess what i was selling sneakers so what's the booking what what's the moral of the story it took a lot of prayers studying and personal growth on my own but i finally hit a wall where i couldn't do it by myself anymore so i decided to go to therapy to continue my healing no matter what anybody else did my healing and growth it belongs to me if my relationship suffers it's on me if i don't trust people's intention that's on me and i refuse to continue those patterns i'm gonna do something about it you can make that decision too but before you go look at these shoes thank you for listening to this week's episode please download our app and subscribe to us on youtube our youtube page is called my black therapy tv you can also find us on facebook under my black therapy llc and our instagram which is at official my black therapy you can also support us on patreon just by searching my black therapy or going to patreon.com my back therapy,2025-06-23 14:57:46.404061 UTC
g1Rdrgm1eAY,Reebok Club C 85 Vintage shoes,hey y'all today I'm going to be talking about these reox sneakers that I got I've worn them a few times now and so I wanted to tell you my experience with them one they are super comfortable and I like the look of them they're great for like outside of work or wearing to work I actually wear them to work with like dress locks or a pair of jeans and they look so cute they're neutral colors there's a variation of colors but I wanted to go over the color that I got because I absolutely love it the details are really gentle this isn't white it's like an off-white and ivory so you can get it like a little bit dirty without it being too noticeable additionally this bottom is like a super gentle pink you really can't tell unless you're up close it's really light and really gentle and then the back has like this fun cheetah print it's a little bit of a metallic so it has a pop of color but not too much so I can still go with everything I like that it's neutral because it matches all of my outfits work and both outside of work casual um and like I said you can dress them up with a pair of black dress slacks or you can dress them down with a pair of jeans a pair of leggings right now I'm going to style them with a pair of leggings and show you what they look like so they're really cute and Casual like I said I'm just wearing them with a pair of leggings the other thing I wanted to knowe is they're true to size I'm I'm normally a size 7 and A2 and these are a size 7 and A2 and they fit me perfectly so no need to size up or down just go with whatever your normal size is,2025-06-19 08:38:08.051823 UTC

that notification Bell so you can be notified whenever I upload a new video which is every single day guys it's a go five follow me on my Instagram and on Tik Tok as Jon J kcks and now let's begin this video so this one right here guys is the new version of the Nike dong low pandas and I got to say that it was about time man it was about time for Nike to finally gave us a really good quality pair of these Nike dun Lo that in my opinion it's one of the best colorways ever this this one right here man this black and white colorway is simply amazing because this is the perfect shoe I mean the perfect colorway I'm talking about because this colorway goes with everything any outfit that you want to wear with this shoe with you can do it I mean these are just essential colors right here it's just black and white it's just that simple but it truly works that's the beauty of the shoe the Simplicity of the callway and I know a lot of people start hating on this callway on the internet they're making fun of the Nik on those pandas because apparently now the the Panda name is like you know when you say panda you're talking about like trash shoe apparently like trash materials and all things like that that people like to say I don't agree with that for me it's a really beautiful shoe not only these but the originals as well the colorway simply incredible the color blocking as well truly truly works in my opinion one of the greatest of all time if you don't believe me just think about the Juden Wan L's Panda the black and white the high 85 amazing Sho was well nobody's hated on those and those have the same color and color blocking as these but forget about that let's go with this one this one has the greatest material that I ever seen in a pair of Nike dong Low's because they totally replace um the materials on this one it's a mix between a black um suede or newu and that nice buttery tumble leather that we have on this one feels really good to the touch man really really nice the quality of the shoe especially the leather areas of the shoe feels amazing amazing unbeliev unable the quality leather that um Nike used for this one Nike it was about damn time man and the quality of this one they really delivers with the quality of the shoe um the Su or Nuuk of the shoe you know is just okay you you can't do that much with this type of materials but it's good you know at the end of the day is the suite is black so it doesn't really matter now the white leather man that's a total different story it's really really good man I man I can spend hours hours just touching this this one white leather that they you have everywhere like everywhere you see um the white leather on this shoe is good good premium quality feeling that this one have for real is really damn good outside of it is the same color and color blocking that I love the black the white pretty nice we have white on the panel white on the toe also right here on the ankle area of the shoe the Mido is also white the tongue as well and we have predominantly black right here everywhere we have that suede material is black like um right here going through the eyelets and the toe the swish of the shoe also right here on the back is black where we have the Nike brand in also we have a black tone tag on the shoe with the Nike branding in white the laces that the shoe comes preset up with are these black laces but this one also include extra P laces which are these on white laces that I know they're going to look super clean with this one but you know know these are the traditional ones the classic one the OG one so they're going to look good either black or white laces doesn't matter they're going to look as just as good you know this is an amazing colorway that like I said you can play with this one a lot even with the laces you can throw a bunch of laces on these shoe to make them pop differently and they're going to work I mean this is the greatest callway ever in my opinion you know I like the Chicago a little more but because it's a little bit more iconic but when it comes to a dope color way black and white goes with everything you don't even need to think about you know like burn your brain thinking about which outfit are you going to wear the shoes with anything you have in your closet just yeah you understand you understand man pretty amazing shoe pretty solid shoe that looks phenomenal in my opinion and the quality on this one just put this one in a whole different level I want to see what haters are going to complain when it comes to this version of the Nikon L pandas what are you going to complain now what what these are amazing for real man on feet they just look as good probably a little better because that leather makes them look you know like in a different touch give them a different touch a different level from for this one so yeah they looks amazing on Feit they fit me the same as all the regular Nik lows so if you don't know which is the size that works the best for you I recommend you to go through the size but the best thing that you can do is go to your local store and try a pair of Nike D loads right there and you know in your local store you can try any size that you need to so you can see which is the size that works the best for you so that's my absolute best recommendation when it comes to the sizing for the Nike D glowes this one is an amazing shoe that I found this one on fot Locker so go to your local fot Locker if you want to get this version of the Nike D Lo pandas it's pretty amazing in my opinion but that's my opinion only and now I want to know yours so go to the comment section and let me know how you feeling about this version of the Nike dong low pandas that in my opinion is the best one with everything in yet there's more to come I hope so because this colorway will never die it doesn't matter how much you hate on these this colorway will never die because this is the absolute best colorway ever Nike dong low pandas man the panda colorway and this one look more Panda than anything else because that black suede just give them that full vibe that full Panda Vibe I love them well

ttN6Hz9_npc,on cloudmonster 2,hi I'm James a knot n specialist I've been giv advice to patients for over 10 years on Footwear and today we're going to break down the cloud monster 2 we try to keep our reviews as concise as possible so you can get all the right information without any waffle we buy all the shoes with our own money so that we can give a very unbiased review so the first thing that we're going to talk about with Cloud monster 2 it's a premium maximal cushion shoe therefore it's got lots of cushioning lots of Stack so it starts off with 35 mm in the rear foot 29 mm in the 4ot ACC cushioning given a 6 mm difference of heel drop from the back to the front of the shoe it's roughly 295 G for men's 9 us and the sole is made up of the healing cushioning it's got a new dual density mid Sole and it's got a TPU plate so not a carbon fiber plate but unique plate by oncloud which gives elements of stability to the shoe to make it super firm so that's one thing to keep in mind first of all it's a really rigid shoe it's got a 4ot rocker on it which have some makeup for that so if you a shoe that's super stiff the 4 foot rocker helps you to prop puls through when you're trying to do the push off phase of the gate however it's a really firm ride overall so we classify it as more of a resilient type of cushioning and what that means is as you apply pressure to it pulses you back super responsive really good for more uptempo work what we found with it it's a more of a stable neutral shoe so maybe not as stable as other premium Maxim issues such as the Brooks ghost Max 2 but it has element stability of it in terms of the side walls which are the heel and midfoot now if you think of a bow in alley these are like guide rails that are pulled up to start the ball from moving side to side well in a shoe just helps keep your foot centered in the shoe As you move it's not as broad as you might get in the for foot of other shoes so it lacks a little bit of stability there but in terms of the firmness of the cushioning and the sidewalls both factors tend to make it a relatively stable neutral shoe we found when we ran in it it was quite enjoyable for faster more up toer work and you can really feel that 4ot rock up Pulse in your forward and it was little bit clunky when transitioning from heel to 4 foot on slower runs and didn't enjoy it as much as the up temper work on walks it was amazing super comfortable really nice to wear all day and if you have a job where you stand all day an excellent shoe for that as well then in terms of the upper and the fit you got loads of space in there so relatively snug on the heel and midfoot and then a super roomy toolbox no issues with the sizing didn't need the size up or anything like that when it comes to the tongue some differences of note so it's a super thin tongue as you can see the gusseted so it's stitched into the shoe so it doesn't move side to side we did find that when you lock down the lace it's a little bit tight on the front of the ankle not a problem for us personally but for some people who get irritation on the front of the ankle the thin aspect of the tongue might be a problem that coupled with the heel counter which was a little bit surprising it has a little bit of excess movement side to side so it's not completely stiff heel counter that you'd associate with a Maximus shoe the reason why you typically want a stiffer heel counter with a maximum shoe is when you have lots of cushion in in a sole it can make a shoe unstable so you add in stability factors like the sidewalls and one of the other factors is normally a stiff heel counter to keep your foot centered inside the shoe personally we didn't have much issue with it but those of you have a bit more movement in the frot and a little bit more unstable you might find that you got that excess movement from the super light upper mesh the thin tongue and the not so stiff heel counter can contribute to allowing your foot to slide on top overall an excellent premium Maximus cushion shoe one that we'd recommend for standing walking all day for uptal work little bit clunkier on the slower ones for us personally but a fantastic shoe overall if you got any questions on the shoe please in the comment section below if you found the video interesting helpful do like and subscribe to the channel,2025-06-23 14:41:02.164954 UTC
hEL8IXS1AoQ,PUMA Suede,hi everybody what's good welcome back to my youtube channel if you're new here thank you for stopping by i am your girl l marquis in paris i do fashion beauty and lifestyle video and don't forget to subscribe for good vibes because i know you want to join the clutch family why not you're already on the video subscribe now so today's video is a little different i've never done it on my channel um a lot of you don't know but if you don't know let me share with you i'm more of a sneaker girl i wear more sneakers than him so i wanted to start a new um what would i call it i got a new series on my channel where i review sneakers and i talk about like new items that i've purchased so um if you haven't watched already i did a video a while ago about me attending sneaker con and i'll probably try to link that in one of the cards in this video somewhere but today i'm here because i want to review the new puma suede sneakers um i just ordered them and before i review a sneaker i have to at least wear them like three or four times i must admit i only wore these twice so far so i didn't get to wear it the third time but my third time is going to be today so um but i love them they are the most comfortable sneakers that i've purchased in a long time i'm normally like a jordan girl um i'll pick up you know a couple of like nike running shoes here and there but mostly it's like jordan's vans stuff like that um i used to rock puma in high school but it's coming back it's fresh it's like a new look so i love it and i'm more of um i like to call my style tomboy chic um so i love to be comfortable but i love to look girly at the same time so let's get into it i ordered a couple of things from puma i don't know if you guys remember when lauren london posted it to her and so let me see if i can find it like on my phone i'll try to insert the picture in the video um yes right here so she posted it on her instagram and i was like yo i gotta have that outfit because i'm a huge lauren london fan everyone who knows me personally knows that i adore lauren london so i was like yo i have to get the whole outfit so um that inspired me to purchase the suite so i got the junior ones um i got a size six i will say that they do run big i normally wear a size six in kids boys but um i should have got a size five i could actually size down in these they're made like super big but i'm going to keep them because it's not i mean it's a whole size up but it's not that bad so i'm just going to keep them i'm not going to return them and i've already been wearing them so i might as well keep them i'm in a green box and they are the suede classic juniors um puma black and white so yeah they come in a box like this almost dropped the box and um when you take them off the box they're just they look like this and the material of course is suede excuse my nail i have to get it but the material of course is suede and then you have the white sole like white rubber sole and then you've got like the classic puma stripes here but one thing i like about this suede shoe is that i love how the tongue you have like the green puma here so that i think that's really dope but um yeah they don't easily get dirty because like i said i've worn them twice and as you can see they're still pretty much clean on the bottom i mean it's like minor dirt but it's not really that bad um and if you haven't watched my sneaker cleaning video i'll link that in the cards as well so you'll learn how to clean your sneakers but i probably will end up cleaning these because i do see a spot right there but it's still it's not that bad so let me tell you guys what i ordered and of course i'm going to try one for you guys sort of video of what everything looks like on so i ordered um the puma if i'm looking down in this video it's because i'm reading what i actually ordered so i ordered a puma convertible bucket bag iconic t7 women's track jacket which i'm currently wearing and i ordered the iconic t7 women's track pants it says zack pants that lauren london had on on instagram i'll show you guys when i insert what it looks like and of course i got the classic suede um sneakers that i just told you about what i would like to mention is that the sole is white but the actual puma stripe is also suede and it looks kind of like kind of like a grayish off-white color so it's actually different from the gum sole and the camera is not doing any justice but that's okay and then you have the side that says um puma suede i don't know if you guys can see that but it says puma so yeah that's that these are comfy i will say that everything runs big because like i said the shoes i could have sized down the jacket i mean i'm kind of comfortable in it i have room um this is an extra large i could have got a large but i wanted it to be nice and roomy the pants i got a large end and actually i should have got a medium because they are really stretchy i mean it doesn't look bad on me but if you want more of a tight fit then definitely get the medium so let me share with you what the bucket bag looks like so the bucket bag is just the classic bucket bag it looks like a bucket it has the puma logo at the bottom um with the stitching and this part is leather i forgot what you call this i guess it would be like nylon or something and then you have the leather handle and you have like the silver hardware on the handle and then you can also use it as a backpack if you wanted to you have two straps in the back or you can um they have this attachment in the middle where you can make it one long strap if you want to so i love this bag it was on sale for 20. i don't know if it still is but i'll have it linked below it can fit a lot of stuff because like if you open this bag i have it pretty much packed but i still have space left um it's pink on the inside like a pink purplish color it has a zipper here which i love you can put something like his personal items in here so right now i have my makeup bag in it to tell you how much stuff fits my wallet i even have a bottle of water in here um i have a notebook in here to write stuff down in case i need to i even have a whole bath and bodywork spray in here hey that's not even a travel sized one i don't even know why i got cookies in my purse that's crazy i got cookies sugar cookies in my purse that i didn't eat that reminds me i'm happy so that must be a snack for me when i go out oops i felt um of course i got hand sanitizer because it's called it and just i have it always i have a pack of gum i have some type of recipe from the post office and then i have a pen i never go wrong with having a pen then i have a brush which i don't really need right now because i have braids but in the zipper part i just have like my my lip glosses and stuff so i have like a lip liner and like two lip glosses in the inside pocket and that's pretty much it but i mean like i said you can fit more stuff in there so that's not even half of the stuff that you can fit inside the bag and this is what it looks like empty and you can pull the drawstring as tight as you need to it has a little clasp where your stuff doesn't fall out and that's that so i think it was a good deal for a 20 bag like i said it's on sale i don't remember what the original price was but it doesn't matter because right now it's 20 and you should go get it so that's pretty much it about that um the classic suede so what are they similar to they're similar to my bands but however because i have very flat feet my bands are not always comfortable with the suedes that i can say that are different from my bands is that the foot insert on the inside is way more comfortable than the ones that vans have so when your feet go into this it's more of a comfortable cushiony feel than bands and they're easier to put on advanced vans are like some hard sneakers to put on i love them but they're very hard to slip on they actually i mean i would recommend vans to actually add like a little um piece back here where you can slip your finger in in order to get it over your heel but with these you don't have to do that you can lace the laces how you want to um they come with black laces that's it of course but you have white ones you can change them out if you want to add colors to it you can do that too but i love these shoes so that's my review of these these are great if you don't have the puma suede go get them because i am in love with them and i will be rocking them even though they have suede material most people would think you can only rock it in winter and fall but i will actually rock these in spring i mean who's going to check me suede in spring who's going to check me nobody suede is still clutch so um yes but definitely get them before winter is up you know we in march now you're gonna have a couple of more cooler days especially in the morning so you can still rock your suede so go ahead and order them off with puma i'll definitely leave the links below and i'm gonna show you guys my outfit now thanks for tuning in and don't forget to like comment subscribe hit the notification bell so you know what my next upload is and as always everybody stay clutch i don't know what you're talking about i don't know what you're talking about,2025-06-23 14:42:13.160425 UTC
zRfNapFCO0A,Reebok Club C 85 Vintage shoes,hi everyone today I'm gonna do an unboxing and review of Reebok c85 shoes enjoy I ordered these directly from reebok.com and it only took less than a week to arrive in the mail via FedEx today and all the product reviews shared that for this sneaker you need to order a half size up so I'm normally a seven and a half medium and I ordered it eight in these shoes all right so as you can see these are in the white light gray and gum and they're good they call them tennis shoes but I'm gonna use these for my everyday out and about I wanted a white shoe specifically to go with anything I'm wearing and something that was comfortable so I wanted it in a sneaker now I normally order on my Reeboks when I go to the outlets um but I didn't have time to visit the outlet this year and I didn't I found this online and I didn't know if my outlet was going to carry it so I went ahead and purchased this this was 75 dollars and it was void of any coupon or discount so just know that when you go to order these um they're both the right size and they look I'll try them on they look really nice foreign overall I like this shoe and I'd highly recommend it um if you're into a sneaker that's going to match with anything that you're wearing I recommend the club c85 tennis shoe from Reebok it's a comfortable sneaker now the fit I'm wearing a slim fitting sock so my heel was sliding around slightly that'll be fixed when I wear a more cushioned sock so I would highly recommend hope you get out there and purchase a Reebok c85 tennis shoe,2025-06-19 08:38:10.481632 UTC
cG4c2tMCnSM,Onitsuka Mexico 66,hi guys I bought a pair of shoe when I was in Japan and I was thinking I want to review it it's an Onsuka Tiger in Mexico 66 thing that I like about it is that it's light the downside is cuz I'm petite this doesn't really help me with my height situation and I feel like some wrinkles have form around the shoe they do have a lot of shoe sizes it's hard for me to find a shoe that fit my feet anyways I would still recommend this brand because it's not that expensive and also it's quite comfy to walk,2025-06-23 14:44:50.303793 UTC
soQYP0OijNg,Veja Esplar,hi guys since we just did the best white leather sneakers post I thought I'd share with you my two personal favorites and why I chose them and kind of the differences between both of them so the two I have are the Vega VR however you want to say espar sneakers and the Nike Air Force Ones white leather sneakers I'm not going to put a year on this YouTube video like I normally would just because white leather sneakers are such a classic style they're not going out of date and I chose these two styles of sneakers for very different reasons like most of us I have tons of Nikes and athletic shoes but white leather sneakers just tend to be that little bit smarter they're not something I would go to the gym and work out in there's something I kind of use more for street style everyday wear so I'm gonna do a review kind of comparison of both of Asia esplan sneakers and the Nike Air Force Ones kind of how the sizing runs on both of them if they're comfortable and or what else why I chose these specific Styles versus any other kind of Asia or Nike style and kind of all the most kind of common questions I've got or I've seen on Google so I can answer everyone's questions but if I've missed something drop them in the comments below and I'll do my best to get back to you so there is definitely something you want to know about white leather sneakers versus material sneakers so if you read reviews I'm like oh my God they're the comfiest sneakers everyone you get yours and you're like these are killing me there's a reason why there is definitely a breaking in period with your white leather sneakers so be patient with them you'll probably find that right across the crease there before they start to be able to bend a little bit that's where they might rub so always I definitely recommend wearing socks or with them I like I'll show you what I'm wearing with my these little guys these little low-rise ones you can't see so you don't worry about seeing socks although that's in this year especially with loafers but these guys will really really help prevent blisters whilst you're going through that breaking in Period okay so let's start with the veil okay so the reason I got the Via Visa however you want to say is sneakers is because I just think there's such a classic versatile style and they're a lot smarter than the Air Force Ones they're also sustainable so if you're looking kind of for sustainable shopping these are a really really good option and they're a celebrity favorite you see them on Meghan Markle Emily ratajowski Emily Watts K Middleton Reese Witherspoon Jennifer Gardner and Kourtney Kardashian to name a few so there's tons of white leather beijer sneakers the reason I went for the white and black version is I was looking for a really versatile pair that I could wear for a long time and with a lot of different outfits and I do tend to wear them with like black leather joggers and black leather pants more than jeans honestly and I love love love the gold pair the white and gold pair they bought out the kind of Mega Merkel was wearing but I just feel like they're going to date quicker and they're not gonna go as much that's why I ended up with this pair I had also tried on the Campo and the V10 and I just didn't find them comfortable the tongue on them came too high and it was digging into the top of my ankle I don't know if it's me who has that problem but that's why I ended up with this style trying to escape the sun because I'm being blinded right now as her time of the day so I find this shoe really really comfortable I'm not gonna lie it wasn't to begin with the crease like I showed you on the Air Force Ones was what was digging in until they broke in they did kind of rub there now I'm kind of like two years into wearing them I have to say they're really really well made they still look great they're easy to clean but the Comfort level it just takes time to get there so be patient with them if you're wondering how they are white leather sneakers sizing runs they do kind of vary and they only come in whole sizes so I find I run true to size in the S blah versus wearing the Campo where it runs a little bit wider you might want to size down a size I would definitely either recommend ordering from somewhere where you can order a couple of sizes and they do free returns or going into a store and actually trying them on I know Nordstrom carries a really good collection of them so check the store before you go in see what they have and then go and try them on okay let's take a look at the Air Force Ones and then you can kind of compare them side to side the pros cons which I recommend if I prefer one to the other or if I think you should just get both okay so the reason I got two pairs of white leather sneakers is because I think they're very very different the they are sneakers are just kind of a little bit more classic a little bit smarter the Air Force ones are just so iconic I also like that they're plain white leather and I like the chunkier sole being short I really really appreciate any excuse with extra high even if it's a flat shoe and it's such a celebrity favorite right now everyone from Hayley Bieber to Kendall Jenner have been wearing them and I am a sucker for buying things and I'm caved in and I finally got them and I'm actually kind of glad I did because I wanted them ever since kind of was it back in like the 2000s with the Air Force One song that came out and now that song just gets stuck in my head but anyway I've got them they're such an affordable wine and a sneaker so let's put them on I did order two sizes because I wasn't sure what size to get the reason being I kind of range from a seven to a seven and a half in my Nike Styles I kind of find they vary a lot and they said to her size down half the size so didn't know to do the 6.5 or the sevenths were just ordered both from Nordstrom again free shipping free returns and just return the ones that don't fit which is why I'm doing this on the car so I'm going to start with the Nike six and a half just because everywhere recommended pretty much everywhere online all the stores said to size down half the size from your normal size and they do come in half sizes I love box fresh white sneakers I don't know how long they're going to stay white but I do love them one of my feet come which one is slightly larger than the other so I am going to try both on because I normally try one I'm like oh that's great and then I try the other shoe on I'm like oh okay I should have tried both on is that one is not so good normally I would get a bit nervous about sizing down to a six and a half inch in sneakers especially if I was going to be working out and then I think because they're not a workout shoe it's not such a big deal it's like my feet are going to get that swollen in them and although they're breathable they're just not a sneaker style I would use for working out I feel like I'd use some more for walking around Europe or walking around cities a lot rather than wearing a flat when I wanted something that gives me a bit more support okay I'm glad I size down I don't think I even need to try on the sevens because these in themselves feel quite big I'm actually almost tempted to go down to a six but then I'm really worried they would be too tight especially in the summer when your feet are swollen I'm Gonna Roll Up My Pants just so you can see things a bit better that's not how I'd wear my pants but there is definitely a bit of a gap in the back but I think these are going to be it because I think they're going to go down to a six they are going to be too too small okay right now they feel like I'm walking in bricks there is no Bend in them at all can you sit on they're going to take some breaking in to get that crease in them I think once they're broken in they're going to be comfortable it's just unfortunately right now I can't give you honest feedback whether they're comfortable or not because right now they just feel like I have two lumps on my feet what I can tell you I can tell you the hills and the balls of them feel really squishy and that's because they do have extra cushioning in the toes and the heels they are also breathable all of the holes in there which you really want with the leather sneakers so you don't end up with sweaty feet they also have that Rubber Sole which is really great for traction so honestly at this price point I'm gonna keep them I'm gonna break them in I just feel like they're such a super cute shoe so even if it's gonna sound bad but even if they're not the most comfortable and I decide I can't walk around cities in them they're not going to break in enough I feel like they're a cute enough shoe to wear with loungewear just from running to the grocery store just for going for coffee that I would still get enough wear out of them I just really really like how bright light and fresh they are I love the aesthetic of this kind of street style shoe it's kind of not my normal everyday style you know from the blog I kind of more like the Glam feminine girly Styles but kind of you when I'm just running around I've got my hair tied up and a baseball cap on I'm not going to be wearing my sleptos am I these are perfect okay you know what now I've done a couple of laps around the coffee table I think I am gonna size down I'm gonna order a six just to compare so when you're ordering I'm not going to update this video when you're ordering I would definitely recommend ordering half a size per full size down or both trying them both out on carpet and see what works for you so you're not kind of like ordering three different times and waiting two months to get the right size so what's the best white leather sneaker for women is it they're there is it the Nike Air Force Ones or is it something else well for me at the moment it's definitely they're there for the comfort for the aesthetic I want to say the Nike Air Force Ones but I want to get the right size first and I'm worried this style they say it's a classic and it's iconic but it does kind of come in and out of fashion versus being more of a classic style for comfort and for fit it was the vein they were true to size but I remember there was a breaking in Period so I'm gonna order the six for the Nike Air Force Ones see if they work out I'll update in the description below which ones if it did work out which size I ended up going with I'm definitely keeping one because I do love them and I will suck it up whatever it's like your favorite pair of high heels right you make them work whatever if you have any questions or comments for your own personal experience with either they're there or the Nike Air Force Ones drop them in the comments below so we can kind of compare reviews and get kind of a more rounded out experience especially if you've had time to break them in or you can kind of give me your feedback on the sizing you went for love hearing from you guys thank you so much for watching if you like this video don't forget to give it a quick Thumbs Up

-3UwDyCoDBw,Veja Esplar,hi guys welcome back to my channel and in today's video i want to share with you guys the viha esplar shoes so these are my first vija shoes and i want to kind of give you guys a little bit of a first impression and what i think and uh some of the like myths about these shoes and again like full disclosure or disclaimer and or disclaimer i may have also gotten the shoes when they've kind of done like a different like update or reconstruction of the shoes so these are just my opinions based off what i've heard and what i have experienced with this shoe okay so first off given the design of the eslars like i personally like loved them i seen them on a tick tocker and when i was like in search of another pair of white shoes in search of like some sort of biha something that would fit my lifestyle and something that i personally would love um i found these and i just fell in love with them ordered them everything then i started kind of getting into like some type of imposter syndrome if you want to say that and i started just overthinking and i was just like oh my god like looking into reviews and people were saying all like things about them and just like they kind of look like bowling shoes and just like i don't know like they were just like not in love with this pair also the toe part of it they were saying that this was just very like hard the overall shoe was just really hard to walk in it took like a lot of like um breaking in uh to get you know them to like start to love this sneaker and just fresh off the box i immediately put it on because another big thing was the size and a lot of people say that this shoe runs big i am normally a eight and a half us and i order i always order a size 39 in euro shoes and that's what i order with these um i also got a little scared because what after like when i seen my order confirmation it was saying that they were unisex and so i was just like oh my god like they're definitely gonna be big but when i tried them on they fit perfectly i've been wearing them without a sock around the house but i know once i put a sock on they're gonna be perfect so like without a sock for me they just kind of lift a little bit in the back but i also have the shoes tied like very loosely and not super tight um and then the part about them being like a bowling looking shoe i don't think that at all i immediately tried them on and i fell in love i thought they were going to be really long i thought they were going to make my foot look big but they do not at all like i love this like outer edge of them because it gives that illusion that they are more of a platform sneaker which i love platform sneakers but i also wanted something a little bit more low-key and toned down and this is perfect um i just love how they look they're very simplistic and going into like my first beehive sneaker i wanted them to be something that i could wear all the time i was looking for another shoe that i could wear to work and i definitely feel like this is something you can dress up or dress down just depending on what you're wearing um and it's also something that you can just wear so many different ways it's so versatile and i can also see why people or why the brand is making them out to be like a unisex shoe because like i can definitely see dario and my husband wearing these as well with more of like some dress shorts and like a nice button down these just look really really nice and i love them i as you guys know i'm very into like minimalism now and just like starting to be very conscious with my purchases and i just feel like this is something that i'm going to get tons of use out of i actually also just did a tick tock video on like multiple ways to style this sneaker which you guys can definitely check me out on my tick tock as well if you guys want to see a video of styling also let me know if you guys want to see a video of me styling these as well i can do a separate video i just want to hop on here and just talk about like the different like myths and the things that i just experienced with this shoe because i feel like a lot of people have like kind of swayed from bihar because of what has been said and it's definitely probably for sure true but i feel like they've kind of definitely went back and thought about their um their construction of the shoe and just like reconstructed it into like a better more like easier to walk in shoe um i definitely feel like these are on the lower price point there are some beehives that are like up there in price but i definitely recommend going into the s blars if you're wanting to get into v has if you want to just try out the shoe and just see how it is i definitely recommend these they seem a little bit more low-key i love the black and white and they're just very different from a typical white sneaker i have white sneakers and i just feel like they all give a different vibe to me and these can be very casual or very dressy just depending on what you're wearing it with i mean with something like this um like this little swimsuit top some shorts and this like bedding down i feel like this would just be like more of a casual style of wearing it but i don't know i just love it and i just wanted to hop on and share my like first impressions and this like little fun way because i just feel like i don't know like some people have been swayed against them and i'm obsessed i have not worn them out i have not um warn them for a long period of time this is just like my initial first impression fresh out of the box of how i feel and i just want to share um just in case there is someone else out there that's looking into this shoe wanting it and wanting to see like what it's about um but yeah just have to kind of get into it again this is how they look it's very white around here and then it is like yellowing a little bit at the bottom and then you have the black v and then when you face it back you have the viha logo as well as inside of the shoe here's the bottom of them and this is also like a sustainable shoe so this is like you know not real leather um and i think that's why a lot of people had issues with it just because the way that they were constructing the shoe um just they were using other materials besides leather and that's the tongue and as you guys can see like it is a little bit on the thinner side people complained about the tongue digging into their foot and then getting blisters specifically around that area um for me just walking around the house it has not dug in um maybe they kind of went with a thinner tongue style i'm not sure thank you guys so much for watching yet another video of mine let me know if you like more of these short easy straight to the point videos because i love them especially if i'm looking to get just like some specific information i feel like this kind of style of video just definitely helps and i definitely just wanted to get the message out there about this amazing brand and i will leave all the information about these shoes as well as their website where i purchased them from and a little bit of like q a down below in the description if you guys just want to kind of look at that as a reference going forward but definitely share this with your friends let them know about this amazing shoe it's amazing and if you're definitely into like minimalistic shoes want to remain sustainable or thinking about going into more of a sustainable style of sneaker i definitely recommend these these are amazing and they're available at several different locations nordstrom made well so many different places so definitely take a look and this style specifically is just one of the styles that i've noticed has been in stock across the board another a few of the other popular styles the v10 the campos are the ones that are really hard to get your hands on once they do remain in stock but definitely check these out because they're amazing and they're a perfect starter shoe going into veeha,2025-06-23 14:57:47.698743 UTC

gK1Zlq6U_FI,Converse Chuck Taylor All Star,hi i'm lorna from wearablyweird.com and in this video i'll be sharing five ways that you can spot fake converse now straight off the bat can you tell which pair are the fakes and which pair the real ones in three two one if you pick these as the fakes you're totally right let's get into five ways that you can tell an easy way to differentiate between fake and real converse is to check the little rubber tab on their heels now if you look really closely at these two you'll see on the fake pair on the o on the converse there's a little star whereas on the converse lettering on the real pair there isn't a star that's a dead giveaway anything that deviates from this design is a fake a quick way to tell if you've got a pair of fake converse on your hands is to inspect the insole stamp as you can see here on the fakes it's printed quite badly it looks faded these have never been worn the insole itself as well isn't cut very well looks a bit jagged and overall you can just feel that they're super thin there's also an r symbol here which shouldn't be present on real converse on the real thing you can see it's printed really nicely and there's the material composition there it looks good there's no machine cutting errors on it it feels plush and it's properly branded with the correct arrow symbol a really obvious way to tell if you've been duped into buying fake converse online is to just take a look at the packaging the shoes come in these are the real deal as you can see they come in a nice quality shoe box with tissue paper everything's branded and is of nice quality these are the face they literally arrived in a plastic bag it's just not good next checking the logo patch is another super easy way to spot fake so if we take a look at the real one first you'll see that there's a nice navy blue star the converse all-star print looks good the chuck taylor lettering is quite thin whereas if you look on this one the chuck taylor lettering is actually kind of chunky looking and doesn't look right at first glance as well you might not be able to see on the camera but you can definitely see it in person on the fake it's a kind of bluish tint the whole patch whereas on the real thing it should be nice crisp and white real converse logo patches should measure 1.9 inches anything smaller or larger than that you've got a fake so if we check here on the fake it does come up slightly smaller yeah see there about 1.8 inches so at a glance in person you can definitely see this one slightly smaller but when you measure there's just no question a dead giveaway for a pair of fake converse is their weight fake converse tend to weigh less in the real thing because they're made with cheap quality materials that are overall less dense and less supportive of the feet so let's go ahead switch on our scale and weigh the fake pair in ounces take a look so over nine ounces on the fakes let me put on the reels and you'll see the difference oh yeah over 11 ounces there really is a two ounce difference it doesn't sound like much but when you actually hold them you can really feel it and overall you can feel they weigh less on the feet and they just feel less supportive when they're fake if you enjoy hunting and busting fakes as much as i do make sure to hit the like and subscribe button it means a lot also linked in the description i have a huge blog post written with 10 more ways to spot fake converse so go and check it out if you want some more tips,2025-06-23 11:21:42.820773 UTC
eWG6-IiSxo0,Onitsuka Mexico 66,hi my name is Sammy from the title of this video I will be giving you a full indepth review of the onitsuka Tigers in the style Mexico 66 SD if you're looking to go to Japan soon or you're just interested in getting these shoes definitely stay tuned as I will give you all you need to know if you want to skip to a certain part I will have everything in chapters down below these are the ones that I got dial is the Mexico 66 there are 66s in the regular and then the SD style I did some research online and the SD has better quality leather and they use better cushioning to make it more comfortable honestly when I was in store I didn't look at which one that this is but looking online I'm pretty sure these are the SD and the colorway is I believe the white slash I'm probably butchering this but dto blue I will link these down below these exact ones in this color way the leather is made with vintage cow along with suede bits throughout the shoe as well if you read online due to the better cushioning and the better material the SD will be a bit more expensive than the regular ones I didn't try various Styles I only saw this color and I tried this one so I can't tell you how they might feel on the foot next category will be sizing so I got these in the women's 23.5 CM Euro sizing 37.5 us5 UK 4 and 235 China size I think I would say that they fit pretty true to size I'll put on screen my sizing for other popular sneakers that I own and how it Compares if you have a similar shoe size to me typically I wear a size six I'd say it fits pretty true to size if you're going to go to a store obviously just try them on in person but if you're buying them online I would say just maybe stick to your regular size and they'll be good it's definitely a snug fit with the slim silhouette but I don't think it's uncomfortable it's like perfect molded to my foot so next category will be pricing and where I bought mine so I did get these while I was in Japan last year in September 2024 and I did get them at the Osaka Namba store I believe these were about after converting them back to Canadian about 170 they were so much cheaper than getting them online which I'll tell you about in a second the benefit of getting them in Japan besides them being cheaper than getting them anywhere else is that you can also buy them taxfree if you're a tourist if you're going to Japan anytime soon I would definitely just recommend waiting and getting them there or checking them out there I took a look at these exact ones on their official website in Canadian it costs 360 and I don't know if they include free shipping I didn't look that far but just the shoe itself I like them but I would not buy them for more than like $200 probably there are a bunch of stores throughout Asia and then I think about four stores in Europe but none in North America so if you're also from a North America like me and you want a pair you will either have to pay way too much money or just go to Japan if you have the option and the money definitely just go to Japan for $360 I just don't think they're worth it for some outfit inspo here are a few clips of me wearing the Tigers throughout my work week honestly at first I thought that they might be a little hard to style or not go with everything but after wearing them for a week and trying them on with different outfits they're surprisingly versatile and really go with a lot I like that it's or the one I got at least it's mostly white which goes with everything but there is a bit of pop of color which is nice I've been getting a lot of wear out of them and for another reason as well that I'll get on to right now overall thoughts I'll give my pros and cons so first pro is one of my friends had these shoes prior and she was really loving them she said they were really comfortable and I own sambas which I feel like is a similar kind of look with a thinner Sole and kind of a Slimmer silhouette they're like comfortable but I don't think they're that comfortable so I was kind of skeptical but after trying them on they're surprisingly really comfortable to be fair I haven't worn them out and walked a whole day in them yet but I feel like my feet would be okay even after a whole day of walking it's something about the cushioning that they're using but it really molds to your foot and the bottom of your foot I don't know how to describe it I feel like you really have to try it on to tell it just feels like it's hugging all the right places and it just feels really comfortable some other Pros they have a lot of different cute colorways that you can get it's just a classic timeless style even though they are kind of popular and trending at the moment this style has been around for a long time and I think even if you wear them when this trend is over they'll still be okay and the last Pro that I want to mention is due to this flap at the back it does kind of help when you're putting your foot in kind of like a shoehorn like you can pull onto this and then stick your foot in moving on to just a couple of cons this is kind of a personal nitpick but the shoelace I guess material or the thinness of it makes it kind of loose as you can see right now the knot is trying to come off I do think you kind of have to double knot it or else it'll come loose pretty easily and even double knotting it I feel like it's not that secure but that's not really a big issue I think the main con is that they are pretty expensive ensive especially if you're not getting them in Japan so honestly that would probably be the main reason you might not want to get them and another small thing is that due to their being suede bits on the shoe I wouldn't wear these if there's a possibility of raining so I do have to check the weather before I decide to wear these overall my thoughts are that I like these shoes a lot more than I expected that I would obviously I liked them so I bought them they really surpris me in a good way that being said I don't think I would get them if they were too 200 something or more because that's just too much money that I don't want to be paying for a sneaker with there being so many sneakers that exist so if you are going to Japan definitely check out a store and try them on you'll definitely see a lot of tourists in Japan holding Ona tiger bags cuz everyone's buying them when they're in Japan anyways that was this review thank you so much for watching I hope you found it helpful and informative if you own a pair or you decide to get a pair let me know which ones you get and what you think about them if you think they're worth it if you enjoyed this video please subscribe I do a lot of Vlogs and travel content as well as some fashion content and I'll see you in my next video bye,2025-06-23 14:44:47.341541 UTC
OtZa41aaosk,on cloudmonster 2,hi people welcome to the run testers and in this video we are going to put two of ON's cushion daily trainers up against each other we have got the new OnCloud Surfer 2 going up against the OnCloud Monster 2 now the Cloud Surfer 2 is the newest shoe it landed early in 2025 while the OnCloud Monster 2 was the follow-up to On's popular Max stack big cushion cruiser it's a little bit older which one of these is best well we have clocked the requisite test miles to find that out and you can find out too by watching on in our OnCloud Surfer 2 versus OnCloud Monster 2 head-to-head so some quick details first then when it comes to stack height the OnCloud Surfer 2 packs 32 ms in the hill 23 m in the foroot for a 9 mil drop the Cloud Monster 2 now comes in at 35 ms in the hill 29 ms in the 4oot for a 6 mil drop the Cloud Surfer 2 weighs in at 9.1 ounces or 258 grams in a UK men's 8 and a half test shoe the Cloud Monster 2 is slightly heavier at 10.5 oz or 297 gram on price the Cloud Monster is the more expensive this Cloud Monster 2 is going to set you back £170 or £180 the Cloud Surfer 2 lands at £150 or $160 moving on to a quick shoe comparison then and both shoes use Helium foam that's super foam but the midsole setup is different the lower stack cloud surfer 2 uses the on cloudtech phase design where you've got these elements that sort of collapse in sequence a bit like dominoes and then release as you roll through with each step you've got a pronounced rocker but there's no speedboard plate in the Encloud Surfer 2 that's normally used to stiffen and stabilize on's midsoles but that's been left out here of the Encloud Surfer 2 with a deliberate attempt to soften the ride the Cloud Monster 2 sticks with the more traditional CloudTech elements that we know on four using a new dual foam setup there's also a nylon blend speedboard plate in the middle of that midsole that speedboard has been reshaped over the last gen of the Cloud Monster with the aim of providing some greater efficiency from touchdown to toe off up top the Monster has relatively flexible and breathable uppers they are quite structured but with perforations here that do boost the breathability the Cloud Surfer has an engineered mesh upper too they're pretty classic on they're quite thick but they're very soft very premium feeling the heel collars on both shoes are really plushly padded though there's definitely more padding on the Encloud Surfer too the tongues as well are different more padding here on the Encloud Surfer the Monster goes through a thin wrapping tongue the The Cloud Surface isn't gusseted while the monsters is and that extends down into like a 4ft wrap you've got quite different lacing setup as well the Encloud Monster 2's lace carriage is much slimmer much narrower on the foot whilst the Cloud Surfer is a bit wider and it comes further down the shoe this bottom rung is much further down into the kind of or the back of the forefoot now if you flip them over and the Cloud Monster has quite a familiar outsole rubber design with pads on all the key impact areas those can sometimes wear thin quite quickly in the heels but there are these sort of mini studs there to help that out uh the Cloud Surfer also has a generous covering of outsole rubber for grip and durability uh good pads in the heel zones here that rubber on the Cloud Surfer is quite thick as well you've got sort of good covering most of the key impact zones uh it's separated here as well so that the sole can flex but you've got all of that kind of protection the other thing to note is there's no really crazy stone catching channels in either of these shoes okay so first let's get into fit how did you find the difference between the Cloud Monster 2 and the Cloud Surfer 2 so I got both of these shoes in my normal size and I was happy with the fit of both of them i prefer the fit around the toes in the Cloud Surfer 2 i find it's like quite a just roomy wide upper on the Cloud Monster 2 it's the right length for me but as some with a fairly narrow foot I find I'm have a little bit lost for space in the front of it there but I don't think it's a big problem i didn't like find it a problem on the run at all and it's probably good for people with wider feet but overall I would stick to your normal size with both you've got a bit more cushioning and padding on the Cloud Surfer 2 and like I say I think it feels a bit more tight around the toes than the Cloud Monster but yeah other than that there's no real problems with the fit for me uh either way how about you Kieran yeah almost identical experience i think the Cloud Server 2 is a little bit more snug it hugs a bit more it's kind of comfortable you get that sort of wrap from the uppers but they are one of those shoes they sort of hold the foot but the uppers flex nicely so you don't feel restricted then you flip over into the Cloud Monster 2 and I did find that shoe yeah it was a little bit it was spacious if you're being generous i found I was swimming around a little bit i had to pay particular attention to sort of locking it down you know I think the flip side of that is on longer runs if I was going to take that for much bigger mileage you know 2 three hours on feet I think that extra room in the toe box would be something I'd go for if I was going to run anything that had particularly kind of steep rolling kind of roads and stuff you know I get my head goes to like a Comrade style run and you're going for that big cushion but you want room in the toe box i think the Cloud Monster 2 appeals to that but it can feel like there's a bit more space than you'd want if you're trying to do anything sort of faster but overall I was really kind of happy generally speaking going true to size in both okay so moving on to the run test how have you used these two shoes in anger Nick what kind of mileage have you done and what was your experience so I've done about 50 60k in both these shoes i've ended up doing a bit more in the Cloud Surfer 2 lately than I did when I was testing the Cloud Monster and that's mostly because I prefer the ride of the Cloud Surfer 2 which we'll come on to i've used them for pretty standard daily training miles lots of just easy outings here and there the occasional progression uh but mostly just you know mooching along at a fairly relaxed pace which they both do well enough but I much prefer the ride of the Cloud Surfer 2 i have to say that rocker cloud tech phase midsole you know since on introduced it it's been a real upgrade for me in terms of their daily trainers with the cloud monster 2 you're getting more or less the classic on experience i actually don't like this one even as much as the cloud monster one but you know the potted outsole the you know the clouds in the midsole which give you I find just quite a clunky feeling but yeah so that's how I've used them at all how have you used them Kieran yeah I mean I've used them both over the sort of same sort of types of runs everything from easy up to sort of just slower than marathon pace i've done some really long runs in the OnCloud Monster 2 i think I've max I've gone up to about 90 minutes in the OnCloud Surfer 2 all of that on road so I have tried them at faster paces as well just to see i think my experience of the OnCloud Monster 2 was it sort of lost a bit of the sort of nice smoothness there was a bit of stiffness and a bit of snap that came with the Encloud Monster 1 and it just like you said it just felt a little bit clunky i think everything felt a little bit more sludgy i don't know whether that sort of feeds into the fit as well everything just felt generally a bit more loose you know it wasn't quite as um efficient and you go back to the Encloud Surfer 2 which does feel more smooth i think the transitions are a little bit snappier it feels a bit more natural you don't get quite as much softness and sync as you do from the from the um you'll find in the OnCloud Monster 2 and I think yeah overall I much prefer the versatility that comes with the OnCloud Surfer 2 because of that there is softness but it's quite balanced i find the OnCloud Monster 2 just a little bit clunky yeah I I think they made that kind of worse and then they brought in the Eclipse which I think kind of filled the gap that I found from the old Cloud Monster yeah you've just got I found a very natural running experience with the Cloud Surf too i sometimes rocker shoes they won't work for everyone you've got to almost fit the exact cycle of that rocker I think on the run and I do with the Cloud Surf it just you know rolls me through very smoothly i feel very relaxed in the shoe it's comfortable like I say it's soft but you don't sink in so much that you're you know then having to fight to get back out again out of that foam you just roll through with Cloud Monster I just you it's just clump so it's not just the midsole I think which is firmer heavier than the Cloud Surfer doesn't really give you much back in terms of energy return it is all the also the outsole since Hon has moved to the less kind of potted outs soles with the Surfer and the Eclipse find the ride a lot smoother in them and I think part of that is the pods you have on the outsole of a shoe like the Cloud Monster which is the classic on design it's I don't know it's all built up to look quite nice and I think it could sometimes feels quite nice but it's not that light it's not really responsive so the midsole just doesn't I don't know I don't know what it really brings to the table for me aside from the fact it probably protects the legs you know well enough on a long run but then lots of shoes do that whereas the cloud surf I think has a has a midsole that elevates the experience of the run like it actually you know I look forward to running in this shoe cloud Monster we kind of got through testing and I I didn't really feel like uh it was a shoe that had really impressed me that much yeah yeah you're kind of wondering the Cloud Monster 2 was sort of supposed to be kind of sort of super plush shoe but then you don't have the plushness of the heel collars you don't you have that thin tongue and they've done that obviously to try and keep down the weight it's sort of medium padded you look at the Cloud Surfer it's gone the other way it's obviously a lower stack so you've got a bit lighter but that's afforded them the opportunity to make the the heel collar's nice and padded and it's nice and comfortable you got those big padded tongues which also make for the comfort so that comes sort of closer the other way and I just feel like it's almost sort of replaced the need for a Cloud Monster because you get enough softness and smoothness from the ride enough protection i think for me personally over even over longer mileage I think it will do enough sort of road impact eating that I don't need to go to that kind of big slightly clumping Cloud Monster 2 setup yeah I Yeah there's not really any kind of run where I'd look at the Cloud Monster over the Cloud Surfer myself i can't really think of any run where I'd rather be in the Monster over the surfer well that's a that's a pretty quick summation of the run test isn't it yeah if every kind of run I'd rather be in this shoe yeah that's that's the one I'd pick so moving on to the verdict then Nick you got to pick one of these shoes got to spend your money on just one of them which one is it going to be cloud Surfer 2 for me easy choice i mean everything about the shoe I prefer like the upper I think is more comfortable and fits my foot better the midsole is more comfortable softer but it's also a lighter shoe so it feels a bit more versatile even the outsole just feels a bit smoother and more reliable so yeah all round Cloud Surfer 2 gets the win for me on this the Cloud Monster 2 I think if you're picking it it's you've been a long-term fan of on you love this feel of this midsole then you know it still offers it within the range because fewer and fewer on shoes I think are going to offer this exact style going forward but I definitely think the Surfer 2 is my preferred pick of these two how about you Kieran yeah I'm with you i would go Cloud Surfer 2 as well i just think it's more natural it's lighter on the foot it's smoother in the transitions for me there's just a right balance of kind of cushioning and road protection to do lots of different miles it's not quite as clumpy i think it's comes in cheaper as well which is another obviously a big benefit i I do you know what i I just think they I really like the on Cloud Monster one i think the the Cloud Monster 2 changed some things didn't necessarily improve it and I think the Cloud Surfer 2 now drops in and sort of sort of plugs a gap i think it does you know it's probably closer to what you might have got back in the on cloud monster it's a bit It's a bit snappier it's a bit lighter it's um yeah it's a shoe that I find much easier to run in and it will cover all the same miles that I would maybe choose the Gong Cloud Monster 2 for but it's doing it in a more natural way with a better feel better fit and overall a better ride so yeah Cloud Surfer 2 for me we've also got a video of the OnCloud Surfer 2 versus the Cloud Eclipse which you can go and check out as well where we've broken those two down there's some really interesting crossover here as well I think in these shoes where you know the difference between the three sort of daily trainers that you've got here from On isn't so stark but it's really interesting so there you have it that has been our head-to-head between the OnCloud Surfer 2 and the OnCloud Monster 2 we hope you found it

jRWZA03pEbs,Converse Chuck Taylor All Star,how's it going we all know the Chuck 70s and Chuck 70 All-Stars are one of the most popular shoes of all time now what you might not have known is that there is actually a huge difference between the Chuck 70 and the Chuck all-stars so in this video I'm going to lay out all the huge differences between these two shoes and ultimately come to a conclusion on which one I think is best so with that said let's get into it so like I said there are two major options to go with one being the Chuck 70 All-Star which is the cheaper version at 65 U.S and then the Chuck Taylor 70s at 90 U.S now with most things in life obviously the more money you pay typically the higher quality the item is and that certainly is true here as well and you'll see that laid out throughout the video but also they do look quite different to the eye as well so let's talk about one of the biggest things that's different in terms of quality and also to the eye and that's going to be the sole of each of these shoes I think this is probably the one thing that really blew me away and shocked me with the Chuck 70 is that the fact that the sole is a lot thicker and you feel it certainly when you slide your foot into the shoe this thicker sole isn't just for looks although you can notice it to the eye but most importantly it allows you to have a little bit more padding in there and that is by far the biggest difference that I can just make up between these two shoes is when you slide your foot into them it is a world of difference in terms of comfort in the Chuck 70 versus the Chuck All-Star now along with more padding in the truck 70s you also have better arch support as well so it's an overall more comfortable shoe the one caveat there is with the Chuck All-Star is much more of a flat Sole shoe so it is a lot better for lifting weights and if that is your sole purpose in the gym then I would definitely go down that road and get the Chuck All-Star now another key call out with these soles to the eye obviously as you can see here that it is much more of a glossy look on the Chuck 70s versus the Chuck All-Star is more of a matte and kind of faded and almost honestly dingy look in comparison another key call out is the soul is a cream and off-white color on the 70s and the All-Stars it's just a classic regular old white look and comparing them head to head you can really see a huge difference and I'm a huge fan of that cream off white look I think it looks really really elevated so depending on your need obviously if you are going to be planning on lifting in the gym then I think the All-Stars do make sense but in totality for comfort and arch support and honestly looks as well I think the 70 has to come out ahead here some other things that are visible to the eye is the laces and the patch of both of these shoes now for the 70 the laces are a bit thicker and have more structure to them and again it is more of an off-white and cream color to match the sole and it has a nice leather patch now the All-Star my biggest gripe honestly is that the patch is just embroidered on there and prints it onto the canvas I don't think it looks all that great and honestly normally it looks fine but when you compare these two shoes head to head I do see quite a big difference now the laces might not be the biggest deal certainly not a make or break but it is a nice touch but I do think the patch is really a game changer and having that embroidered leather patch on there just is a really clean nice detail let's talk about the fabric and stitching of each of these shoes and obviously been talking about more premium quality for the 70s and that's definitely going to stay stay true here as well the fabric is a little bit thicker here and it is over 12 ounces in weight and just holds a little bit better structure to it which I personally do prefer sometimes I don't like how it looks like the chuck all stars are just a bit droopy or floppy and I think having a nice thicker fabric is a good look Additionally the stitching is more double stitched near the toe box so it's going to prevent from that creasing and last a little bit longer now when it comes to the overall look this is definitely more of a subjective thing but I personally do prefer a more bulky look of the 70 I think it just looks a bit more high quality and more value there and honestly it is still a slick and slim shoe overall like I personally do prefer that style of shoe now let's talk sizing there are definitely a little bit of differences here and it comes to the all-star you're going to want to size down probably about a half size and I think that's going to be a good place to put you in in terms of being close as possible to true to size and then for the 70s you're going to want to size that all the way down probably a size or maybe even a size and a half if you go into the store and try them on your yourself I think that's probably the best option I went down to a nine and I typically wear a 10 and honestly I think for the 70s I could have gone down all the way to an eight and a half so that's just something I would call out there and then for the All-Stars I went with a nine and they fit perfect so let's talk about colorways and color options now the All-Stars definitely have a couple more options but honestly now you can just edit them and make your own designs right on the website so if there's a certain colorway that you can't get in the 70 and is available in All Stars then I would just go ahead and make those yourself so even though the All-Star is about 25 dollars cheaper in US Dollars which is best and worth the money and in my opinion I definitely think the Chuck 70 is way way worth it personally I think the look is just much much better and I like the thicker Sole and comfort that comes with it and ultimately you know it's going to last a lot longer because it has that double stitching thicker canvas and all the other things and benefits to go along with it and if that's not enough for you I just think it looks a lot better to the eye as well the one caveat there is if you are going to be wearing these shoes for lifting like I said said earlier on in the video definitely do go with the All-Stars it's going to be a lot more suited for lifting in the gym now you can find each of these shoes in the description below but I would be curious to know which one you're gonna go with so please leave a comment letting me know now I hope you guys found this video helpful so if you did please give it a thumbs up and if you're not subscribed to the channel already please do so other than that I'll see you on next week's video,2025-06-23 11:21:45.864852 UTC
ICpOvDTyOoI,Adidas Superstar,huh this is one of the weirdest and honestly most out there sneakers that I've ever seen from Adidas what's up everybody I'm Seth fower and today I'm checking out the upcoming Adidas atti foam Superstar but before we dive into things this episode was brought to you by the unboxed app and their swap to cop program now I am a small part owner of the unbox app and I I think I'm literally legally required tell you that so just keep that in mind in my opinion the unboxed app is one of the best sneaker apps out there it helps you categorize your sneakers you can ensure your collection and you can legit check your shoes on there but they've just added my favorite feature on the app called swap to cop so swap to cop allows you to take new sneakers from your collection that you may never end up wearing and swap them for a pair of shoes that you would actually like to wear every few weeks the unboxed app holds a swap to cop auction where they put up a couple crazy sneakers for bid and then you can bid some of the sneakers in your collection and maybe even throw cash on top and the winning offer gets that pair of shoes for usually a better price than what it's going for for resale now obviously because you're bidding on a pair of sneakers you do want to put your best offer forward but the nice thing is is that you don't have to put up hype pairs of shoes just shoes that share a similar value to the shoes that you're going for so for example this week they're auctioning off the Cactus Jack 4S and the Travis Scott Black Phantom 1es and all you need to do if you're trying to win either of those two sneakers is offer up pairs of sneakers from your collection that generally equal a similar value what's nice about that is you can offer up a couple brand new pairs of dunks that you have that you bought for retail that you just didn't really want and trade them for something like the Travis Scott Air Jordan 1 Phantoms so if you want to check out this week's swap to cop for the Travis Scott Phantom 1es and the Cactus Jack fors it's happening this Saturday at 700 p.m. eastern time Link in the top of the description below so with the rise of almost entirely foam clogs like the Yeezy foam Runners and of course this Lei bbery Crocs it's no surprise that aidus is trying to jump on that wave we saw earlier this year when they released the atdi foam q a shoe which apparently is inspired by the Adidas Quakes however it does bear more than a passing resemblance to the foam Runners but it kind of seems like adid this might have gone too far and made a foam pair of sneakers that may not need to have been made and that shoe of course is the Adidas Addy foam Superstar a shoe which is based off of the classic Adidas Superstar and when looking at these two shoes together the similarities are very apparent I mean obviously this shoe was inspired by this shoe and I guess it shouldn't be a surprise that they decided to model their latest foam sneaker off of one of their most popular sneakers of all time the Adidas Superstar but the question is does the Superstar actually make a decent foam sneaker and in today's video we're going to find out first things first though let's talk about the release information for this shoe as of right now there is no official US release date for the Adidas atti foam Superstar it is thought that it's supposed to be releasing near the end of January 2023 for a retail price around $8 no one really knows for sure because this shoe has released overseas but not in the US yet and the conversion rate makes it look like the shoe is going to be around $81 but I don't think that's going to be the price I think it's going to be something like either 80 on the nose or maybe $79.99 either way if you want to grab a pair of these or just a standard pair of Adida Superstars which I think I'd actually probably recommend more i' made sure to leave a link on your screen or in the description box below this video so this shoe is honestly a mystery to me I don't know why Adidas thought that this shoe would be a good idea sure it's not as bad as you'd think that it would be on foot and know it doesn't look as bad on foot as again you would think that it would but at the same time I don't know how dasas could have thought that a foam version of a non- foam shoe was a good idea I mean they did it with the Quakes but at least with the Quakes or the atti foam Q's the shoe looked very different than the original shoe however in this case it looks very very similar to the superstars and I don't think that's a good thing now as far as packaging the Adidas atti foam Superstars do come in your standard Adidas box it is pretty large but that's because the shoes themselves are pretty large the official colorway of this shoe is SE white black black and it seems like the shoe is also releasing in an inverted version where the white parts of the shoe are black and the black parts are white but other than the awful spelling of the word Addy film that's the most interesting part of the Box let's get back into the sneakers so as you can probably tell these shoes are made up of primarily foam hence the named Addy foam Superstar now what's interesting about these shoes is that these shoes are actually made up of two different parts and I'm not talking about the top part and the bottom part which you can see came out of the mold in two different pieces the top half and the bottom half separated by The Parting line through the middle I'm actually talking about the fact that this shoe has an insole now the insole of the shoe is made up of ortholite and it's actually pretty thick which is good because the foam itself is not that soft and of course as you can tell the insole comes in a similar color of white with the Adidas branding printed on the heel and seriously it's a good thing that they added this insole because without this insole I've actually worn the shoe without it and it's relatively uncomfortable with the insole however it's actually pretty soft underfoot however there are some parts of the shoe that make this shoe something that I probably wouldn't wear on a daily basis but getting into the design and sculpting of this shoe as you can see the entire upper of this shoe is covered in this really interesting sort of Ridge texture it's kind of similar to what they did on the Adidas adlet 22s the shoe that Kanye said was a knockoff of his Yeezy slides on that shoe if you look at it from the side it kind of looks like a topographical map if you look at the Shoe from the front directly at the front of the toe it kind of has the same effect but but it's not exactly the same and while I don't totally understand this surface texture and treatment it doesn't make the most sense to me I do think that it does cut down on some of the glare and the glossy look that this foam sneaker would have if it wasn't for that texture it almost makes the shoe look less cheap I feel like if you were looking at the shoe and it was just a smooth piece of foamy plastic material it would be very glossy and it would look like some random knockoff but if you look at it now while yes it's not the prettiest thing in the world at least it has some sort of texture to kind of separate the light so that it doesn't look as glossy or shiny another interesting detail and honestly one of the main details on this shoe are The Ridges that wrap all the way around the top of the toe and you may have already guessed the reason for The Ridges but they are inspired by the original shelltoe Superstars which also have similar ridges however because this shoe is a little bit more futuristic and made up of one piece of material they sculpted it in as sort of a texture and Main detail of the sneaker and while yeah I don't love these ridges I do have to say that I like them better than if they had just given the shoe a standard shello I feel like that would have looked even worse now I know it sounds like I'm hating on this shoe and and while there are a couple things I don't like about this sneaker I don't think it's a bad shoe overall but we'll get into that a little bit later on in the video as you continue back on the side of the sneaker on both the lateral and the medial side of the shoe you have these raised Adidas three stripes in Black now I'm not going to lie the first time I saw this shoe online I thought that these were painted on details but when you look up close you'll see that they actually are raised off of the upper of the shoe however because of the way that they're molded into the shoe you'll notice that some of the straight lines aren't as straight as you would have thought some of the black bleeds into the white a little bit which does make them look a lot more painted on like someone took some tape and then sprayed them on and then pulled the tape off and there was a little bit of overspray or some paint that kind of seeped underneath the tape it's not the cleanest look in the world but it's not that noticeable but it does make this shoe feel a little bit more DIY than I think it should I actually think the shoe might have looked better if the stripes were the same color as the upper kind of like the Quakes or the foam runners or even a color that wasn't as contrasty as black on white I feel like it's a little bit too much but again I understand that they're going for the Superstar look and the Superstar Stripes do provide a very heavy contrast on the side of the sneaker so I understand what they were getting at I just don't think it was the best implementation turning the shoe around to the medial side you'll notice these two small ventilation holes where your foot kind of rests sometimes they're covered up by the insole sometimes they're not I don't think that's anywhere near enough ventilation for this shoe if you look at something like the foam Runner the whole shoe is ventilated even if you look at the Quakes a lot of the shoe is ventilated this shoe is just a huge chunk of foam on your foot and in the summer this shoe will absolutely get incredibly hot speaking of which even in this cold weather I found that the shoe did get pretty warm on foot when I was wearing the sneaker outside and I I also have to say that the foam itself which I've already alluded to a little bit but the foam itself is pretty stiff in fact almost uncomfortably stiff that was one thing I noticed when I was wearing this shoe around my toes were very very confined in this shoe there was enough room for them to just kind of rest but whenever I lifted them up or tried to wiggle them a little bit they really hit the foam harder than I would have expected and because the foam doesn't have any give it kind of hurt now as far as the underfoot Comfort that's pretty decent because of that ortholite insole but I will say the foam is probably stiffer than I think it should have been I think it should have been a much s foam similar to the foam runners or even the Quakes this foam is just I mean it's literally like almost like a plasticky foam it's crazy how hard this is and sure it does allow the upper of the shoe to have some structure and that's probably one of the reasons why they were able to mold this pretty intricate texture into the upper of the shoe I don't think they could have done it otherwise maybe I'm wrong I don't know but I feel like the foam is just way way too stiff I mean even compared to these Crocs which are already a pretty stiff shoe this atdi foam is is stiffer it's crazy and hey I don't know maybe there's a chance that the more that you wear this shoe the more that it'll wear in and get a little bit softer over time but I kind of doubt that and I feel like if you don't want a shoe that feels like you know a hard piece of foam on top of your foot maybe don't get this one moving towards the ankle area you've got a pretty standard looking ankle cutout obviously this shoe is a booty construction there's no separate tongue the ankle area is a little bit tighter than I would have liked and because the foam is pretty stiff there's not a huge amount of give plus the edges are a little bit sharper than I would like they're not actually sharp but because this foam is so hard it can chafe against your ankles I found that that was the case for me me however when I was wearing a brand new pair of Apothecary socks it didn't cause any problems whatsoever we've got the graffiti collection dropping in the next couple days if you guys want to check that out Link in the description below it's not just graffiti socks either we're also dropping an entire clothing collection called the sneaker Heaven collection it's fire you definitely need to check it out and that's all dropping on a pothecary dcom Friday 11:00 a.m. eastern time but even though I didn't love the way that my toes felt in this shoe I think the ankle area was probably the biggest pain point for me I just didn't like the way that it felt on my foot but at this point let's get to sizing and fit and the Adidas atti film Superstar does seem to fit relatively true to size albeit a little bit small if you're grabbing a pair of these maybe go up half a size however because you don't have laces you're not going to be able to tighten this shoe up at all so try and grab a shoe that will fit on your foot without sliding off every time you walk so because of that I guess I would recommend going through this size however like I said it is a tight fit and honestly your feet might feel the clamping effect of the upper of this shoe continuing back in the shoe towards the heel you get to the iconic top part of the heel area which comes in Black in this case and features the ad's treay foil logo embossed out of it then moving down on the shoe you get to another relatively perplexing detail on this shoe which is the midsole area now like a standard pair of superstars the midsole actually comes out of the side of the sneaker a little bit to create I guess the illusion of there actually being a midsole but because this shoe is foam why did they do that it's really like they're just recreating the superstar in foam which I don't understand especially when you take so many creative Liberties on the toe of the sneaker why are you making the heel part of the shoe so similar to the original but hey the entire shoe was wild so I don't know why I'm asking questions and then finally moving to the bottom of the sneaker you get to an outsole that's molded into the foam which is definitely inspired by the superstars so this shoe is is pretty weird is it for fans of the foam Runners is it for fans of the superstars is it supposed to be for these new fans of both I don't know but it just it's kind of the worst parts of Both Worlds it's not a greatl looking foam sneaker and it's not a great looking superstar that being said it's not a terrible sneaker overall you could definitely wear this shoe around it's not the most comfortable shoe in the world it gets a little bit hot and your toes definitely feel a little bit constricted personally I don't see someone who's going out to the store to buy a pair of superstars picking this shoe up and being like sure I'll grab that and I definitely don't see people who are fans of the foam Runners running out to the store and grabbing this because they're like oh it's a new foam Runner the crazy thing is though is that this shoe did sell out when it sold overseas at least on Aid's website it hasn't sold out some of the other retailers that are carrying it but there is some demand there I just don't know who it's from I mean is it from other sneaker YouTubers I feel like those are the only people that I would know that would be interested in this shoe I just don't know what to think about this sneaker this shoe is weird let me know your thoughts on this in the comment section down below let me know whether this is something you'd want to grab as always thank you so much for watching and I'll see you all in the next one,2025-06-23 14:43:39.536968 UTC

I was like ""Thank you check out."" But yeah the 2025 edition is pretty cool I think and we're going to start that off with the outsole it is translucent yellow just like it always was this looks very very bright though compared to the original it's not the same tone i know that would bother you actually I'm going to bring in the extra set of laces that they come with the laces are a yellow and they're not the same yellow as the shoe or as the outsole this yellow that the laces are reminds me more of what the original shoe looked like cuz I feel like this is too bright i could be remembering I felt like this with the UNCC1's i also felt like this with the Mellow 12s so for all I know my brained up and I just don't know it but I felt like these were a little bit deeper of a yellow i I can't remember but either way we've got a trifecta of different yellow shades whether you like it or not and that's just kind of what it is the yellow on the outsole though is definitely just kind of It's kind of neon it's like highlighterish so yeah I don't remember them being like this maybe once you start wearing them they'll get a little bit darker i'm not sure but the pattern itself is the greatest traction pattern of all time it's fantastic its traction is so good it'll pop your hip out now the midsole is a cupsole and it's a rubber cupsole at that inside of that rubber cupsole is a polyurethane wedge and inside of that wedge is an encapsulated airsole unit sitting on top of that is this piece of right here this is an awful insole and uh you can take this out so long as you take it out before you wear it cuz you see all these lines here are actually glue so as you wear them your foot and the heat that comes out of it will actually heat this up and the pressure from your weight and everything like that will adhere it down so the insole will be damn near impossible to remove afterwards unless you use a hair dryer on its lowest heat setting and sit there and wave it back and forth until the glue heats up and then you would be able to pull it out easier but still I would take this out instantly and change it out for anything now the upper based off of what I remember I feel like and I'm I'm pretty sure I'm remembering this wrong too i remember the upper on the original 2007 release being a lot softer and feeling just nicer in hand but I know that they were synthetics you know what I mean like I I know that they weren't good materials this though this is an SE release so typically with an Air Jordan 1 midse and we have talked about this previously in a previous video where we lined them all up together and told you the differences between quality this is a better quality they just feel stiff so uh I feel like the the materials while better than maybe the 2007 release they just don't feel as soft as those but again they make up for it with the tweaks that they've made along the upper with the shape and all of that stuff so maybe there's like a trade-off there but either way the black material is it's an actual leather it's just not good leather not anywhere close to good leather by the way but there's leather traces or traces of leather in it and then on top of basically all of those little like pieces of scrapped leather fibers they've glued on this synthetic Newuk coating uh it's not genuine Newuk where it's literally a piece of hide but it does have animal material in it so uh this is not vegan friendly or anything like that it's not uh fully synthetic or anything it is a synthetic top coat though synthetic in the terms of it's mimicking Newuk without being Newuk now the yellow portions are leather and in some portions of the shoe it looks pretty decent like say the swoosh it's a nice thick cut looks pretty good the rest of it though is ultra thin so again it's real leather it's just not the best leather or anything like that is it SE quality or anything like that i would say that this is on the lower end of the SE mids that I've seen some of the most recent SE mids that I run across in store are actually really nice including the leather like there's some really good pairs out there they just so happen to be mids so if I'm comparing this shoe to some of those this just doesn't feel quite you know on par with that material quality or the the level of material that the majority of the SE models get i think that this one is just a little bit more hyped up and I say that real loosely because it is a mid but it's just a popular colorway so I think they're doing what they can to get away with not spending as much on this one because they don't really need to although I will say that there's a little extra touch here on the ankle collar which is the Wings logo it's a Jewel Wings logo which is just like the original version back in 2007 within the pack but different than the 2017 version which was just a pressed on logo and stuff like that like what we traditionally see so they at least reverted it back to the way that it was supposed to be so this is more of a one:1 retro despite the shape changes to its original counterpart now if you were to look at a side profile picture of the original you would see that the collar right here has definitely been reworked since that 2007 release this guy just feels a lot more natural looks a lot better it looks a lot more like an Air Jordan 1 and not necessarily like an Air Jordan 1 mid whereas the 2007 release there was a definite like dip in the collar and stuff like that they made it more comfortable to wear i will say that especially since some of this like this synthetic New Buck is stiff so this is going to like somebody's ankles but again a refined product it looks smoother right now so I like this the biggest change at least in my opinion actually comes on the heel and this little bottom panel right here as you can see on this most recent 2025 edition it's just the panel there's nothing else there you know what was there originally the Jumpman logo it was but yeah the original version had a Jumpman on the heel that's how a lot of the retros after the initial like OG retros from 1999 and stuff like that that's how they were i believe that's how the 2017 was as well with a heel jumpman these just look a lot smoother it's very simple though to be able to look at this and know that this is the newest one versus one of the oldest ones because again that's the biggest change so that's how you would know the tongue is not my favorite thing it is nylon but it's just really padded like this is one stiff piece of material right here they don't put the stitches all the way down them like they have been on some of the more recent ones where they kind of like fold and move along with your foot shape and stuff but the more that you wear it the more it'll break in it's just not my favorite thing i wish they would just do a regular nylon tongue if anything I think I remember these being Newuck but I could be wrong now in terms of sizing they do fit true to size whatever you typically wear with an Air Jordan 1 that's exactly what I would go with here again the materials are just not quite as soft as something like an OG high or some of the other midsees so you're just going to need to break them in a little bit but outside of that if you used to own these and you really missed them so here's another chance to get them or maybe you really wanted them and you didn't get them again here's another chance to get them so I think that this is really cool it's a shoe that every time I see it it just brings me back to a simpler time in sneakers and I really dig it like this at least back then it was a vibe but with all of that being said what is today's user submitted question of the day okay the ability or capability to play basketball or wear anything black this includes shoes shirt heck even your underwear if you had to give up one of those two things which would it be i'm playing basketball what kind of question is that that's the question of the day take away something I absolutely love or something that I mean I could live without it i'd miss you in a black shirt i mean I wear predominantly black i know so you wouldn't be able to anymore i know so I'd have to pick some weird color but like not even hints of black so yeah nope so I'd only be able to wear like solid shoes or or like Yes yeah no I'm still picking basketball but those other shoes still exist right they still exist you just don't get to have them okay you know how long I've lived without them things what's a little more time you know what I mean i just live vicariously through everyone else like I did growing up it's okay i'm good playing basketball okay cool let's sound off below and let us know your answer for today's question of the day and on top of all of that what do you think about the Air Jordan 1 Midse New Love coming back once again thank you guys so much for being here thank you so much for watching we will catch y'all in the next one so until then you guys have a good one look no I think they're leftovers from those Jordan ones i thought the same thing like I normally don't agree with you about the whole color thing it doesn't it doesn't bother me usually but this is atrocious like this is like a blatant like nobody cared it's like somebody said ""Is this the right color in an email?"" And the dude was like ""Yeah sure."" Yeah no it's like highlighter melted crayon and golden rod like I'm like ""Bro that's crazy how'd you up three times",2025-06-19 08:40:07.508450 UTC
GKMB7fD6x-U,Converse Chuck Taylor All Star,i don't want to take it Go ahead and disappear Okay I'm so I'm so dropping it like every single day All right CH What is going on guys and today we are back with another video And in today's video we have another sneaker review I know in 2025 we've been bringing back the sneaker reviews It's because there have been a lot of anime collabs And the most recent anime collab is with Naruto and Converse There is an entire line of these that are dropping There's I think close to 10 pairs that are dropping and we have three of them to show you today So shout out to Converse for sending these over They did not have to send these over but I really do appreciate it Also got on the Converse shirt the Sasuke one Like I said this is a whole whole collaboration A lot of stuff is coming out from this collab A lot of different clothing items a lot of different shoes and everything There's actually shoes that you can customize But today we have the Itachi We have Naruto and Sasuke the first pair that I like the most which is the Itachi pair So I believe this is the only shoe that they did that wasn't a Chuck Taylor if I'm not mistaken These ones are the Converse Weapon Mid That is exactly the name of this model and they just look so good These remind me of like early 2000 skate shoes just kind of more of that puffiness An entire padded ankle collar padded tongue the New Buck upper It's not even suede This is all Newuk So I really did like these ones when I pulled them out of the box I didn't know that they were going to send these over I thought they were going to send the Naruto Sasuke and Kakashi So I'm I'm not complaining at all These ones are absolutely beautiful And like I said my favorite out of the three um that I have and they just look so good You have a red lining on the inside All the pairs have a mismatched insole So on one side of the insole you'll have the character that corresponds with the colorway And then on the other side you'll just have the Naruto and Converse logo on the back of the tongue For the regular Chuck Taylor there's a design On the back of these ones there's not but that's because it's on the front of the shoe Because on other Chuck Taylor there's really no designs on the tongue They're normally put on the back But for this one they were able to put it on the little pull tab on the front Love the mangaku shaing Love the little Itachi symbol Um looks so clean very minimal and that's really why I've been liking these anime collabs that have been coming out because they are very very minimal They're not too much It's not Itachi's face on the side of a shoe or anything like that It's not cringe They They do them good And I feel like the Converse the entire Converse collab they did really good like that by just adding in smaller details that you know only people that watch anime would know but you can still get away with just wearing them as a regular shoe and nobody's going to think twice So these ones very very nice Um I would probably change nothing about these I thought they were they were really good So that is definitely my favorite pair out of the three Next let's take a look at my second favorite pair which is the Sasuke pair I'm always a huge fan of Sasuke inspired shoes because one I love Sasuke's colorway I think it's such a unique colorway That gray purple and blue that they always use is so nice And two a lot of the collabs recently they've been using the purple rope laces I'm not going to go on the whole spiel again but I went to school for sneaker design I designed a pair of Sasuke shoes like four years ago now And when I designed the pair of Sasuke shoes before they were Sasuke shoes I would always put the purple rope laces because I thought that would be a cool detail And now all the brands put the purples in the purple rope laces So yeah this is what the Chuck Taylor does look like Just your classic Chuck Nothing too crazy Nothing was really changed I feel like the tongue might be a little bit more puffy but even then I don't think that was really a drastic change Um on the inside you got Sasuke On the back of the tongue you got the shing gun And then what is really cool about all the Chuck Taylor is that it has the regular Converse logo but instead of the regular Converse star they actually used like a shuriken material to try to make it look like you know a ninja star So that's really cool And then my al also my other favorite detail about the Sasuke pair is the curse mark So you have just your regular little curse mark logo right here that you know you see everybody get a tattoo of on the back of their neck but you get to see this on the side cuz they could have did just an entire gray upper but the fact that they added in like the fading curse mark like the residuals of the curse mark just looks so good And then on the back right here you got the blue strip going up Again blue tongue And like I said the color way was good They didn't like do too much with it Pretty much just an entire gray upper little hints of blue and then the purple rope laces And I kind of like that there's no purple on the entire shoe just besides the laces cuz it's just kind of just it kind of just has that pop cuz that's literally the only thing that Sasuke has is just that purple rope He doesn't have purple anywhere else on him So yeah that is what Sasuke's do look like And then also on the back of all the Chuck Taylor they're all going to match and they're going to have the Converse logo and kind of like a headband material So yeah I thought that was cool All the boxes are the same I don't think I mentioned the boxes but this is the print that you will get on all your Converse boxes And I think that it looks so good cuz they did these five characters for like the first five shoes There is a Sakura pair though but I guess they didn't add her in the in with the rest of the gang But they got Gar Kakashi Naruto Sasuke and Itachi Love the artwork on this box You have a Katsky clouds going throughout the entire box right here Little shuriken converse logo Converse regular logo Naruto Shaudin on the other side more of this and more of the logos So really cool box for you know people that keep their boxes and use them as display pieces I think it's a really good box Next and final pair that I have at least is the regular Naruto pair Now I think that these ones are very good cuz Naruto is a very bright and loud character So every time we get a Naruto collab shoe nine times out of 10 is going to be an orange shoe Um and you know I don't really wear orange that much but I think these ones are cool These ones got toned down a little bit Yes the side panel is very loud but you have a black lace set You have a black tongue to put it down a black strip on the back the black seal logo on the side So I feel like yes it's very loud You literally have a yellow in inside lining but it's not too loud to the point where you wouldn't be able to wear these a lot So I think the seal logo is probably my favorite part about the shoe because it's all embroidered It's not like printed on or anything I think the Sasuke ones were printed on if I'm not mistaken Yeah it kind of looks printed It's not really I mean it has like a little bit of a texture to it but like this is all embroidered which I think makes it even better So really do love that little detail on the side Black on the back right there Again same headband logo Same Converse logo as the other pairs as well And then on the inside you have that picture of Naruto And on the back he actually has a little Kurama which I think is really cute So yeah that was the Naruto pair They didn't do too much with it Like I said they could have did more but they didn't which is why I like them so much because it's just his seal on the side And I'm kind of happy that they did the seal and they didn't do like the Leaf Village logo or like something else Like they tried to do stuff from everybody's character So like Sasuke obviously Curse Mark you got Naruto with the seal logo and then Itachi you just have the Akoski cloud So that was the review on all three of the Naruto shoes that I did get Again there's a bunch of other ones They did just release today May 22nd 2025 is when I am releasing this video and that is when they came out So yeah W Naruto collab Cannot wait to see all these other brands that are going to be releasing Naruto and just anime collabs in general This is like our fifth or sixth collab of the year We've already done Bleach A6 We've done Dragon Ball Crocs Naruto Crocs Hunter Hunter Rebox I don't know There was other stuff as well A lot of other brands have been collabing with anime and there's going to be so much more to come So yeah I will definitely be trying to get all of the anime sneaker collabs that come out So shout out to Converse for sending these over I appreciate y'all And that's pretty much it for today Catch you in the next video and we out Take my girl to the store Get her what she want Louis bag on a see the cost Me and so damn rich we ain't even got a fl And by rich I mean the gift that life will give you a boss I'm particular with it,2025-06-23 11:21:44.299165 UTC
hmoSDyB7G6k,Adidas Samba,"i think every single person in the world is wearing sambas right now but are you wearing the right pair all the big companies have their regular shoes and then they also have their made for skateboarding styles like Nike Dunk and Nike SB Dunk converse has Chucks and like the Converse Con's Chucks i almost got into a huge argument trying to sell some skating chucks on Facebook and I priced them higher than normal Chucks because they are and some lady was coming at me in the comments saying I was trying to scam people cuz Converse don't cost that much and she didn't know that they were skating Converse and she's replying to every single comment being like ""Don't buy it they're a scam."" So that just tells me that people don't understand whether it's skating versions if they're supposed to be better or not but the sambas like these two pairs are almost identical in every way and feeling so David Blu tile sent these to us and he was saying even he wasn't sure the exact differences luckily we can cut them in half and really expose what's going on inside so for that one guy who's always commenting collab with David Blue Tile win there you go it finally happened so the difference is minimal so I'm going to go through layer by layer to tell you what the real difference is and then I'll do a little like skating review and how it actually feels at the very end so if we go to the boot info so the brand is Adidas the style is Samba OG uh they weigh 12.2 ounces they retail for $100 and they're made in Vietnam uh the positioning on the website says ""Born on the pitch the Samba is a timeless icon of street style this silhouette stays true to its legacy with a tasteful lowprofile soft leather upper suede overlays and gum soul making it a staple in everyone's closet so I'm going to call this one the OG from here on out it's the non-skating version if we go to the other version so this is the Adidas the style is the Samba ADV uh they weigh 12.2 oz and they retail for $100 so exactly the same as the other one the positioning on the website of this one says ""An indoor football staple adapted for skateboarding by Adidas the Samba ADV shoes feature an upgraded T-to design with two layers of Atti tough toe reinforcement allowing feel flick and durability known for its locked and fit the molded sock liner and signature tongue wings create a stabilizing fit while the grippy cups ensures the feel and board control so there's a lot of marketing jargon going on in there uh upgraded ttoe attit so let's dive into it so first off the fit and feel these literally feel the exact same on your feet so if we go to the leather um on the OG one it has full grain leather upper with gritty suede and gold foil details and the ADV it says it has a leather and suede upper so both have pretty heavy finishes on them the OG definitely feels like stiffer and chintzier than the ADV so let's start the actual test to see if there's any difference so the thickness of the suede the OG comes in about 1.4 mm 1.45 mm thick and the ADV comes in at about 1.5 mm thick so they're pretty dang close especially for suede so I cut the toe off both shoes to see if they're actually double layered or just fakes and surprisingly both shoes are truly double layered like you'd want to see that in the skating one to get doubled layers but to have it in just the normal general release like having it actually be a double layer is super surprising and you almost never see that in any company ever super good for skating huge bonus for non-sking so that's pretty good now if you go to the leather the OG it's 1.5 mm thick but the ADV is 1.6 mm thick so slight edge to the skating ADV but if we go to the macro of the finish you can see some differences cuz in the OG it's a heavily PUcoated leather it has a very embossed pattern to make it look like real leather if you go to the ADV it's PUcoated leather but it's a little softer and more tumbled and malleable it's less of an embossed finish as well jeff Mic the New Balance designer was saying that sometimes the PU coating makes it a little more durable for skating but it all depends on the actual leather itself so he took it to the burn test on the OG you can see the coating burns off and it kind of shrinks and flakes away but it is still real leather it's not just you know plastic coated garbage on the ADV the coating melts a little bit and then flakes off to reveal real leather so they're about similar on that but if we do a macro of the grain grain is like the fiber structure that holds the shoe together the tighter the fibers are like up on the skin and it gets loose into suede so it's like it goes nice to not as nice so on the OG there's no grain at all it's just a PUcoated suede so it stretches really easily it's just not a super nice leather it's pretty much just like a bunch of groundup suede with a PU coat laid over on top of it if you go to the ADV there's also either no or very little grain it stretches but it stretches less than the white since it's slightly thicker but then if we run the puncture tests on it the OG punctures at 120 lbs and the ADV only punctured at 59 lbs i don't know if you can tell but like the ADV is so like malleable and stretchy it feels good and this one's just like stiff and tough and kind of chintzy so I guess that's where the puncture tests are getting that like crazy variation so is the ADV actually upgraded for skating i'm going to say yes the leather on the OG is pretty bad quality the white leather is just drier it feels worse the suede is much drier on the OG so softer more malleable leather will be better for skating it'll just like mold to your foot better and faster and just feel less chintzy than the light layer what is it that you guys have been asking us for non-stop blood core belts look at that so super limited quantities these are a pain in the butt to make and so get them before they're gone you know you're going to be a little bit of the testing batch so we'll we'll I'd appreciate some feedback how to make this work better cuz this basically the boot thickness leather doubled up sewn together with our classic solid brass buckle that's not the only brand new thing that we released so we finally released all the wallets including the Clayton and Blood Core you can see that the edges are not nearly as bright it's cuz we have to burnish them but that'll start popping out more as you wear it too just like the actual Bloodcore concept is but there's more cuz we finally People This is another thing people like ""Hey we want to buy Bloodcore."" So we got little baby panels and we got the big daddy panels and then you obviously got the boot pocket kit you got coasters you got the little bracelets you got the ring kits so limited quantities get them before they gone especially limited quantities on these and cuz it's just a trial run we're we're we're learning how to do this with this leather and so it's a little bit of a trial run thank you guys for your support of Bloodcore you can only get it from us and we finally opened it up to a belt and all of our wallets so check them out below so if you move to the inside they both have the same fake leather collar and leather lining you get your typical textile sneaker lining so nothing special on either of them but if you go to the insole the OG it has a removable open cell foam like it's got all the glue strap and but if you go to the ADV it's also a removable open cell foam but it's much denser and like you can see that it holds its shape a lot more but if you put the durometer to it you can see that the OG comes in at about 10 sh which is really soft and the ADV comes in about 25 sh so it's definitely harder and denser um it'll make it a lot better for impact absorption while skating it's still super thin and it feels like nothing on your feet it will last longer and compress a lot less quickly than the OG so is the ADV actually upgraded for skating i would say slight but yes i would rather have this insole than this one for the long term moving to the outsole so on the website Adidas calls the OG outsole a gum rubber cups and the ADV a flexible rubber cups but they look exactly the same same tread pattern same everything feel about the same so back to the hardness test to see if there's any difference at all so the OG comes at about 75 shor which is pretty hard for a sneaker um like usually you see it in like the 50 to 60 range for like a mass-produced sneaker like this but the ADV comes in at 65 Sh which shows that it is actually softer than the OG so the pros and cons of that so a harder outsole is going to last way longer but it's going to be more slippery a softer outsole will be way grippier and more flexible but it's definitely going to wear down faster than a super hard rubber outsole like that now if you throw them on the puncture test the OG punctures at 131 lbs and the ADV punctures at 108 lb so is the ADV actually upgraded for skating on the outsole I'd say yes the softer outsole is definitely better for skating it's kind of at the cost of some longevity but I'd rather have a softer grippier outsole than a harder more durable outsole specifically for skating so far the ADV is looking slightly better for skating but it's still quite minimal so let's cut it in half to see what else Adidas might be hiding in there and see you know the full story of what's actually going on all right so got them cut in half uh make sure to go check out David Bluetile he runs Blue Tile Skate Shop in South Carolina he has a YouTube channel where he shows off all the shoes that he gets so if you want to go check out a pair of the skate helas go buy them from his shop i think that'd be sick so let's see what's inside all right so there's actually three big things in here that make the ADV actually upgraded for skating so under the leather on the ADV is a piece of rubber so technically you can see that the ADV is actually triple layered so you got layer of suede layer of grain leather and then layer of pretty thick attit rubber reinforcement right there but I want to see how big it is so I actually cut off the whole upper and it's actually huge it's like the full toe on one side and weirdly enough is it's asymmetrical on the inside of your foot it tapers down to just where the toe suede is but on this side it's the whole foot all the way to the stripes so that's actually a pretty smart idea because you know on the inside of your shoe you're definitely not going to get as much wear for skating as on the outside of your shoe where you flick and ollie the second thing is that the ADV tongue has about double the amount of foam as the actual OG it's kind of hard to tell while you're wearing it and skating in it like now that I have it cut in half and I can see the foam I'm like ""Oh yeah there is definitely more foam in there."" A big foamy tongue is like a staple of skate shoes like just ask Andrew Reynolds he loves that huge DC Links puffy tongue uh especially if you grew up in like the early 2000s and the 90s a big puffy tongue makes it a skate shoe so this is just you know there's a little extra foam in there it's not huge but it'll definitely make a little difference if you're skating for a long time third and most important difference is how it's constructed while the OG Sombra does have a double toe cap you can see that the grain leather stops before the outsole and the suede is actually what's holding the top to the outsole it's kind of a copout so if you were to skate a non-skate version shoe you'd flick a couple times blow through the suede and then your whole shoe would be opening up and hanging loose on the ADV you can see all three layers go down into the outsole it makes it way more durable it's just way better of a construction but it's definitely like the suede is the weakest part of the leather on the shoe comparatively so what you all have been waiting for is the actual skating analysis so it feels like you're wearing a leather sock it literally just conforms to your foot so the suede toe stitching bust fairly quickly it held on for about 3 weeks before totally ripping off and like chipping away um it would be way worse if it was just one layer like if this was your shoe and you had one layer and a buster be like ""Well that sucks."" But this one has I still have the leather and the attitu toe so that's definitely a sick skateboarding upgrade and you can see on the leather I didn't even go through the leather i haven't even made it to the Attitough yet and this is skating for about 3 weeks or so there's super minimal cushioning like this is as much if not more board feel than a regular Vulk shoot when I'm doing my middle kick flips there's times that I landed and my toe would like curl around the board so it's it's a cupsole but it feels really really really thin um I was just skating the Andrew Reynolds 933 and then going to this was like a whole different world it was like cushioning foam good stuff and then just like oh here's a sock with some rubber on it that you can skate so that definitely made my feet and knees ache a little bit since there's no cushion at all that's just the column rubber outsole right there the outsole it's super grippy uh it felt really solid to skate in i didn't put any holes in it like you can see where I was flicking it started to kind of chip off around the toe but no holes in the bottom it's definitely wearing through a little bit on my toes where I like pivot but other than that the outsole held up really well like it kind of reminds me of like a last resort where it breaks in a ton but then it just kind of hits this plateau where it doesn't get too soggy like for the first few times I was wearing it I was like ""Oh this is good oh it's breaking in a lot oh I don't know if I like this."" And then it just kind of stopped it was like if it broke in anymore I think I would be like ""This is too soft and too soggy for me."" But it just kind of hit a point and stop which is kind of sick so overall it's a pretty decent skate shoe especially if you have a board feel over cushioning uh I definitely wouldn't be jumping down a bunch of stair sets or anything in this they definitely make your feet hurt a little bit just because there's no cushioning but that's kind of what this shoe is for so if you're jumping down big stuff I'd avoid it but if you're just skating like especially if you're like a ledge skater or like super tech guy I feel like these are going to be super sick for you so as overall I think you should absolutely buy the ADV sambas over the OG sambas if anything just for the construction most skate shoe models are like $10 to $20 more expensive but these are literally the same price so why doesn't Adidas just make them all this way cuz they're actually better and will definitely last longer than these i don't know crazy they're the same price yeah literally just get the skating version it's way better like Nike SBS are like 20 bucks more now and Converse are like $25 more for the skating versions just buy the skating versions of Sombas if you're going to buy Sombas that is my plea to you I suppose so let me know what else you guys want to cut i want to do some more Adidas skate shoes but like I don't know there's so many different models like do you guys want to see the Tyon the Superstar Advinates let me know i've also started like a skating testing pool so if you have any opinions on shoes you've skated or like you want to get your clips in the video of shoes that are coming up you can sign up for that below i'll reach out if we do a video and hit you up and kind of see what you think about it i guess that's it so see you",2025-06-19 08:40:58.999228 UTC
gXng6f2SPuY,Nike Dunk Panda,i want to see if the panda dunks are worth buying everyone's basically seen me is in some capacity by now but i'm going to get a fresh pair laced up to see what we think i got this pair from the last nike restock and it comes in a red nike box looking at the shoes i really don't think they're anything too special as they're just a black and white dunk and nike's literally put out so many other colors this year that a lot of them just feel the same now as i started to try them on they definitely look nice but when you think about how everyone has them right now and the fact that they go for double their retail price i personally wouldn't grab a pair unless you can get them for retail but that's why,2025-06-23 14:49:37.297599 UTC
dby7i7p02nY,Nike Air Max 90,i'm not even mad at this okay hey what's good guys my name is chris welcome back to the officialweartesters.com youtube channel today we've got something pretty special because these are back this is the air max 90 bacon now these guys are set to release on friday they're going to be pretty hard to get because the originals are extremely rare or limited or whatever they're just hyped up you know what i mean it's like one of the more hyped up air max 90s maybe of all time and so you might need a little bit of help and with that being said we've got a sponsor for this video and it's a good folks over at soul savvy what is soul savvy that's a great question soul savvy is an online community full of sneaker heads made by sneakerheads and basically they have sneaker monitors that monitor all the sites so when something like this comes in the stock it'll notify you so long as your notifications are turned on it'll directly add your size to cart where you can check out smoothly and hopefully beat those bots that also works for restocks as well so if something like this gets i don't know returned or whatever or there's a bunch of bot orders and then a lot of them get canceled and there's a magical restock online most of us don't even know about those things again their monitors will catch them they'll notify you as long as your notifications are turned on and then you can check out smoothly hopefully beating those bots but it's not just a sneaker monitor system again soul savvy is an online community full of sneaker heads that actually like to wear their shoes communicate help each other out you know community so if you or somebody like that and it sounds like a good place for you you might want to check them out we have a link down below in the description box it'll head over to soulstabby.com where you can read all about it if you happen to miss out on these even with their help somebody in there might get them and they might be able to help you out i think that's pretty cool and with that being said you know after all these years you would think that they'd be at least able to make them smell like bacon do you want your feet to smell like bacon it's not about me wanting my feet to smell like bacon it's about the original designer of the colorway who wanted these to be like bacon but do you remember that episode of seinfeld where he puts the mutton in his jacket and she gets attacked by all the dogs yes but it's not actual bacon i don't think that that would happen so these things right here again they're called the bacons and i'm not a big fan of this shoe i'm just gonna put it out there right now but i will admit the quality on these things are fantastic i never had the original pair so i can't compare them for you guys all i know is that the pair that i have in hand right here most of you guys are gonna like these if you like quality shoes like quality materials pretty much everything on here can butter man like they're really good so i'll give it all of that stuff again i just don't love the colorway it's just not my personal thing however this is one of those shoes that has one of those stories that makes me like these things no matter what this is a real sneaker head story right here so there is a man whose name is dave ortiz he is an og sneaker head or whatever there's a great video on this by the way so i'll just let you know if you wanted to leave here and go watch that video i personally wouldn't even mind even though it's a competitor channel and stuff like that but the sneaker news youtube channel has a video and i think it's a couple of years old but they talked to dave ortiz about what this was all about and he tells the whole story he's going to tell it way better than i can all i know is that i was smiling from ear to ear listen to this dude because it was like my youth like i was like that's the story that like we would remember and stuff like that that's why not the only reason but it's one of the big reasons why a lot of us are into shoes because we have a personal story with some of these shoes you know what i mean like we did something in them where we waited for them or we'd mowed hell alarms for them or whatever it might be so he told this story where he bet his friend that he could make a shop and buy a shop i mean like an actual store or boutique or whatever with the dumbest name ever and it'd be successful he won and they called it dave's quality meets this was a sneaker store i thought it was a butcher shop like i had to like research research i was like what is dave's quality mates and it turns out that it was not a butcher shop it was just a sneaker store designed like a butcher shop so there was like shoes inside of a meat grinder with the laces coming out of the other like it was cool man like they don't do stuff like that anymore so we have the boutique dave's quality meets a sneaker store that sounds not like a sneaker story it sounds like an episode of seinfeld they just need a soup nazi it might have been him like if you if you look at this dude man he like just everything about him i'm like man i with your dude like you're super cool but anyways he had this story it was really successful at least locally which is something i'm a big fan of and nike actually proposed to them that they make a collapse they gave him about three months he procrastinated they hit him up like two days before the shoot they were like bro if you want to make this shoe you got to do it like now now so he needed some inspiration but he's hungry you know that you can't work on an empty stomach man so he went down and got a bacon egg and cheese and while he was eating it light bulb it's like everybody loves bacon so he went down to the store and he bought like four different packs of bacon like different types of bacon and went over to his friend's house and he laid out all the bacon they cook some of the bacon and then what he did was he took all the different shades with a pantone swatch that were featured on the meat okay this is the most random thing ever and he made this colorway out of that but the funniest part to me is when he took the two shoes okay and then he said when you do this that's bacon i know and i was like that is awesome that is the coolest thing i have ever seen on a shoe and it's one of the dumbest things i've ever seen on a shoe and that my friends was exactly his point he wanted to do something so stupid but it sells now as far as the shoe itself goes this one right here is a different shape than what we've been seeing on the recraft as well as the air max 3 recraft actually i do want to see what these say they do say air max 90. they don't say air max 3 so i know a lot of us have been like what the are they so from what i could tell og colorways or the air max 3 the recraft 90s are usually styled like an og as far as the color blocking goes but they're not og colors they're just cool fun colors some of them have been retros before or whatever so they're like re-releasing but in the recraft form then there's these this is not either of those two things and the main tail between that not only is the toe shape right here which is a little bit more big bubbly and boxy and stuff like that but it's actually the swoosh there's a stitch line that goes through the upper and everything like that on the recrafted versions and the non-recrafts look like this where they don't have a stitch going through the swoosh it's a super small detail other than the shape but it's just something to know however the tech specs should be identical so we got that waffle sole right there which i think is dope this particular one doesn't look super cool because it's all brown but you know it's still a dope thing the midsole is polyurethane and good news they are of the new air max 3 midsoles the polyurethanes where these things are like just they should not be this bouncy you know what i mean like it's ridiculous like i'll go from a jordan to this and i'm like why why even bother putting a jordan back on because i love jordan's man look at my shirt okay look at the shirt but these right here man they're just comfortable dude they got that visible air sole unit in the heel i do not know if there's one in the forefoot they're supposed to be but it also depends on which era of the shoe that there is again that recraft version supposedly there's not one in the forefoot but in the air max 3 supposedly there is one i'm not cutting mine open so if you want to just hit me up let me know i'll go check out your video your pictures whatever now again the upper on these guys is where things really stand out not only are the colors pretty weird but on top of that the materials right here just get nice dude like i have nothing bad to say about them they even come with extra laces too so you got the red laces right here you've got a pink laces in there plus these brown ones however it is that you want to do it you want to switch you want to swap you want to wear one or the other but what we have here are just a mixture of great materials so this bottom brand right here is a nice suede it's a shortcut suede but suede nonetheless and then we have a nubuck right here which is that dark bacon color i guess that dark maroon and that material right there will bleed there's already a little bit of it right back there what a little bit just to let you guys know it's genuine materials with genuine dyes color transfer can happen some people say that's a quality thing that's a quality thing in a good way it lets you know that things are real okay it happens it does now the little swoosh right there that little pink guy it is leather it's a really thin cut of cheap leather that's probably the cheapest part of the shoe and then the toe box area is just a nice leather as well as the ankle and then the tongues right here just really cool i love the way that they almost incorporated all the color on there you got the tan the pink the brown the red on there with the tab now as far as sizing is concerned they do fit true to size so whatever you typically wear an air max 90 or an air max 3 that's exactly what i would recommend i personally go true to size i think that they fit great they are going to be available over at phenom and phenom global if you're in the sacramento area by the time you see this they're probably like the raffles probably closed by now they're 140 retail so i wouldn't go and pay like the resale prices i've seen the the original retail prices are crazy how high it's just it's way more it's over a thousand yeah i know i know i don't know at least that one was actually rare though you know what i'm saying so these ones right here i don't think that they'll resell like that at least i hope not but i just hope that people that get them actually know what they are they know the story behind it it was such a i don't want to say like a thing against the establishment or whatever but like that guy dave ortiz he's got that mindset of like well you i'm just going to do something ridiculous well when you were telling me the story originally i was envisioning him putting something together like lady gaga and that dress that she wore and i was just like yeah it was really funny because like back then uh they don't so much now it depends on like the brand and stuff but shoes used to come with little silica packs to keep the moisture away while they're in transport he wanted to take those out and put in a pack of bacon bits just so that when you open the box it smelled like bacon and so that's what i'm saying is it like the smell it smells like leather and a little bit of glue and some suede and it would just be funny if they were able to make cause you know scratch and sniff stickers and like there is a size sticker in there if that was if you scratch it smell like bacon i don't know like it just it would be funny it would just be a cool little like nod to the story be really weird because i know you're a stickler you'll pull out every single sticker i remove those things i don't like them well most people leave them i'm like 50 50 and i know if i forget like my foot will seal it to the shoe yeah which is why i take them off and so i can just imagine like forgetting and those first couple wears being like exactly that's exactly my point is that if you were to wear them with a sticker that smelled like bacon it would be funny you know to be like it just it would make it would make the story elevated just that much more i think it would be hilarious so something i also forgot to mention though is that the liner right here is a leather base it's not real leather but it feels like it so i think that's really cool it's like a vinyl the whole shoe just looks and feels premium um again you put them this is the coolest looking thing when our power is combined yeah we make the best meat of all time but yeah let me know what you think about these down below in the comment section are you going after a pair are you not i wish everybody luck i hope that you get a pair and with that being said thank you so much for watching thanks for the support check out soul savvy check out the web testers discord community all the links are down below in the description box check out phenom and all that stuff too we got their socials and their website and everything and that being said hope you all have a good one yeah yeah peace you,2025-06-23 11:26:30.852864 UTC
AkqHuY6Z3rw,Nike Air Max 90,if bruce wayne wore nike sneakers i think he'd be wearing these perfect hello there broski's irkin back here with another banger 2 review we are having a look at the air max 90 in triple black now i do get a lot of requests for this channel and i'm open to it but this video was way overdue there were so many people commenting asking for this review but way back last year i did actually buy these but little did i know i ordered the wrong size i actually ordered a nine in the women's so come up as a seven and a half uk men's size and that wouldn't work for me bruh so i had to send them back and i couldn't really review them like i normally would now these do retail over here in the uk for 120 pounds and where i can i will leave some purchase links down below as well now if you've been watching long enough i scream so much about the air max 90 being my favorite air max of all time and out of my collection i think i own most air max 90s i own about six of them and i just can't get enough especially the recraft version and this is exactly what this sneaker is but before we dive any deeper into this silhouette let's have a little look at the box and as you can see it is your red standard nike one and the product sticker does read air max 90 and the official colorway is black black black and white now i don't know about you both keys but i can't really see white on this sneaker maybe they've got the product sticker wrong but hey we move but touching on the sizing before we have a closer look at the silhouette it is very standard in terms of sizing and if you've got any other air max 90s before these fit very much true to size just like those but if you've never owned an air max 90 these are true to size anyway i go size 9 with all my air max 95s 97s max 90s and ones as well so my advice is stick true to size now i know what you're thinking this sneaker may have a little bit of a reputation not as much as the air max 95s or the air max plus aka tn i feel like triple black sneakers really get a bad reputation just because it is everyone's go-to and especially for those people who do things they shouldn't be doing but hey i'm not one to judge that's for another time another day another video this sneaker is so versatile you can wear these to school to work and just pull off as your everyday sneaker but if you're still unsure let's take a closer look at this sneaker now it is a very standard setup in terms of its design it is of course the same style but where things do differ a little bit from other styles in all black to the air max 90 is of course the materials used one thing that stands out straight away is the nubuck materials on the mudguards and the nike swooshes you have to take extra care of new buck materials on sneakers otherwise they'll be ruined forever now the only other panel with nubuck is of course where the toe box is and the laces are it's got that little strip right at the bottom but other than that it's mainly of this synthetic lever and of course this mesh so you could really beat these to the ground and they'd still look pretty decent but making our way to the laces these do come in these flat black laces with this tpu cut out to the lace holes as well now this being a recraft it does come with this puffy tongue as well and it does have a nylon feel to it with the nike air max branding on top of it and on the insole it is also black with the nike air branding in sort of an off-black color again we've got the nike air branding at the back like most other air max 90s do have on top of this rubber panel and making our ways to the midsole of course it is of that classic air max 90 look and feel the comfort is right up there in my opinion i could easily wear these all day and not feel a thing but there are some other people that don't really rate the max 90 as much as i do but i guess it's all down to personal preference and finishing off on this outsole again we've got the same setup to the air max 90 in this waffle black design this air max 90 even though it's in all black there's just something about it that you don't really see every day most air max 90s that i have seen in all black they're mostly of that level material and they don't really look too appealing compared to these but of course both keys will come to that part of the show where i have to decide whether these are a buy or a buy okay kids you already know i know you know i know you know hold on hold on let's slow down a minute i know you know i know the answer that's where i was going with it now if you're looking for an all black nike sneaker especially a comfortable one then i don't think you could get any better than this the lightness to this silhouette and of course the colorway is very traditional from an air max 90. the only slight difference is is of course the shape like the tongue and the toe box for example they're more cut nicely i feel like the new school max 90s are a bit too narrow and sharper in my opinion yes they do look good but the recraft versions are more my cup of tea but i can't really say much more than i've already said about the air max 90 they are very comfortable they look stylish and you can pull them off with so many different fits and the max 90 in all black are on sale quite often so you could get yourself a nice little bargain but overall broskies i don't think i can fault this sneaker one bit yes the nubuck materials may need some looking after but if you are on top of that then bob's your uncle these are good to go of course overall i have to give this sneaker a buy but i am interested to know what you think about this silhouette is this the all black sneaker you have been looking for are you still weighing up your options in terms of getting an all black sneaker leave it all down below and i will be pinning the best comments anyways my bros keys thank you for watching thank you for supporting hit me up on my ig as well because i'm most active on there and of course don't forget to like subscribe comment and share and of course till the next episode take care you,2025-06-23 11:26:32.726082 UTC

the nice cream a6 gel light three this was sent over to me by the team over at nice kicks thank you so much fam i'm so happy to have this in hand i was so stoked when i saw the first images of this so i just want to show a quick letter actually before we start and this says hi marissa thank you for your support here's a little something to help kick off your summer stay cool thank you so much to the nice kicks team i'm going to try and stay cool in these all summer long so we are going to start off by going through the overview of this beautiful ice cream colored silhouette then we're going to jump into a size and fit on this followed by how i styled this this was such an incredibly fun shoe to style just because of all the details and different materials used on this spimoni colorway then we're gonna conclude with how these shoes are doing on the resale market currently so let's jump into this overview this literally takes me back to my childhood so in washington there's a place called the spaghetti factory and it's this massive place that's beautiful in downtown seattle and the one thing that they give you for free after every meal is spimoni ice cream so this definitely took me back to my younger years because one of my favorite things to do growing up was to go to the spaghetti factory because i knew at the end even if i didn't ask for it they would always bring me spimoni ice cream so definitely fill in the colorway on this shoe since that is the ice cream flavor that this is actually decorated after so let's start with the frontal portion of the shoe which is kind of got that vanilla base to it and this is literally some of the nicest high quality leather that i have felt in a while this is a job well done we've got kind of this frayed look to it on the front of the toe box so you've got kind of a cream and a light brownish hue for the suede on the front of the toe box where we've got those perforated holes working our way up we've got just some nice simple cream laces that they added to it but we do get a second pair and i actually am obsessed with these emerald laces i think this is actually what i'm going to swap color wise out with just because i think that this really pops off of that tongue that's in cream then we've kind of got this chocolatey brown textured color scheme poking through here on the tongue and that's representative of the chocolate flavor so on the eyelids again we've got just hues and accents of the chocolate color scheme to kind of finish off the frontal portion of the shoe so let's take a quick peek at those details before we move on to the side panels so all right moving on to the side panels we've got this beautiful shiny patent leather in the cream colorway on this tonal caging system in that cream texture all throughout the side panels we've got more of this beautiful kind of light brown suede working our way to the back we've got hits of what represents the strawberry flavor in the ice cream and we've got nice kicks logo which is very subtle on the back the collar and asics as well in that strawberry color tone more of this nice kind of cream and chocolate the inner mixes perfectly with the strawberry tone working our way to the other side panel this is actually one of my favorite parts of the shoe which of course what is an ice cream without a cherry on top so we've got this hang tag with the cherries and this emerald base with the asics in the white on a nice kind of gold link here just gives it a little something i don't know it definitely really put the cherry on the top of this shoe literally so again we've got more of the nice patent leather in the cream color scheme with that cream caging system more of this suede and then we've got the gel light 3 on the side back there working our way to the insole we've got some nice cherries again on the insole with a nice just strawberry insole color scheme the shoe is then finished off with this really cool splattering going on here on the midsole over that cream base and then we've got kind of that spimoni coloring scheme to finish it off again with the chocolate color some white here for that vanilla and then the emerald on the base which is actually representative of the vintage glassware that you would see in a vintage ice cream shop so there you have it let's finish taking a look at those last details and i'm gonna talk about the box and a little extra gift that was inside so all right so included inside the box was a nice kicks ice cream scoop how cool is this and we've even got some cherries on the bottom of that ice cream scoop just the little details nice kicks anytime they do collaborations i feel like they do such a good job with just the littlest details that really just make or break the shoe and this definitely is such a nice little gift and surprise that i found inside the box as far as the box goes we've got cherries on top and you'll see on the front portion it's actually melting down the size which is super cute uh and then we've got just that nice kind of cream and teal base underneath the box here you'll see that we've got that emerald popping out so they definitely stuck with the same color tone for the box and that just makes for a whole package shoe all together just such a cute and quirky well put together ice cream shoot for the summer time all right so now let's jump into size and fit so for those of you who don't know i've already done uh a6 gel light 3 this is actually one of my most comfortable shoes i've worn you've already heard me talk about how i absolutely love my sean weather spoon asics gel light threes uh so this was easy for me i stuck true to size on this in a size seven and a half again i do have high arch narrow feet so depending on whether or not you have flat feet that are on the wider side that could decipher a better fit for you but on this one i would recommend staying true to size seven and a half again it correlates to a size nine or as equivalent to a size nine in women's all right now let's jump into the styling portion this was such a cool campaign i saw the photos that nice kicks had posted and i think they did such a great job styling in that ice cream parlor so i decided you know what maybe i should take this to a cute ice cream spot so that is the location that you're gonna see set for the styling photos that i did for the spamoni inspired colorway so i really wanted to bring those spimoni colors into this look for the first look i decided to just kind of keep it you know more patterned because i think that patterns go great with this so it was a very patterned pair of boy shorts in this kind of emerald green cream and pink color scheme i really wanted to pull from all the colors on the shoe and i pair it with just a simple cream button down top and i feel like it just matched these colors to a tee do for the second look i decided to wear a cream tank top the one i'm wearing now actually underneath a button-down denim kind of pink strawberry colored uh shirt and i paired that with some green shorts again i think all three colors just match this to a t and give it a just nice subtle lifestyle look the last and final look i wanted to dress it up while i was eating that ice cream so for this look i decided to wear an emerald green blazer that i think matched this perfectly and then underneath i wore just a total tank top with a very cute little fluffy skirt that was polka dots in a brown colorway at top a cream color scheme so so you let me know out of the three looks what was your hmm yes now so all right now let's conclude with how these shoes are doing on the resale market these shoes retailed at hundred and thirty dollars and currently for resale they're going between 180 to 200 depending on your size all right that's it for this unboxing and review be sure to hit that subscribe if you haven't already and you're new to the channel be sure to give this video a

EqWsNAuIF-M,New Balance 990,if there's one thing these two groups of people have in common it's New Balance whether you're trying to get rid of nagging metatarsal pain or throwing fits on Tik Tok or a little bit of both New Balance has something for you and the brand is unique in its wide ranging appeal I mean you don't see Rockport dropping limited edition collabs with Todd Snider there's something about the New Balance brand the design language and probably the marketing strategy that has helped it reach far beyond the running shoe market and establish itself firmly in that lifestyle category quick side note thank you to my friends at lrange for sponsoring this video and for making these awesome trousers that I'm going to tell you more about in a little bit back to New Balance but before all the exclusive drops before sneaker heads and hype beasts were even a thing New Balance put in decades of research and development in order to create some of the most comfortable sneakers that money could buy and this focus on Comfort is still a huge part of the Brand's DNA it's why New Balances were the only sneakers that Steve Jobs wore it's why podiatrists will often recommend this brand over more popular household names like Nike or Adidas I know this because not too long ago I was at the podiatrist trying to figure out why my feet were hurting I never had foot pain before I could always just wear whatever shoes I liked I didn't need arch support insoles I didn't even know what pronation was but a couple years ago I started noticing that by the end of the day my feet were hurting and they started hurting in the middle of the day then all the time especially in that front metatarsal area it didn't matter what shoes I wore they all hurt I was like this guy but not as good-looking it was horrible so I did what any red-blooded Millennial would do I asked Reddit and one brand kept coming up over and over again Maisto just kidding it was New Balance specifically the 990 model from the Brand's made in USA collection supposedly these were the full siiz luxury sedan of supportive sneakers and they are priced accordingly at $200 I ordered the $9 90 V6 the latest and greatest iteration of this legendary model and I'm going to tell you all about them right after I tell you about today's sponsor lrange is a london-based men's wear brand that makes modular Staples designed for comfort and versatility I love both of those things me too their Flagship piece the 24 trouser has a hidden elastic waistband and internal drawring so you can wear them comfortably all day without needing a belt belts are overrated to True made in Europe from regenerative cotton these come in a bunch of different colors and two different fits slim and relaxed the slim fit follows the shape of your leg but it's by no means skinny or tight the relaxed fit is almost straight it just has a subtle taper down to the leg opening both fits are meant to be rolled to the perfect length and I love this because I like to customize the length of my pants depending on what shoes I'm wearing in this case I prefer slight or no Brak because with the relaxment of the trousers and the chunky sneakers I just think it looks good and these these really are Do-it all pants you could wear them to a big meeting at the office you could go wine tasting with your friends you could wear them on a date to an art gallery who am I kidding I wear these at home I have been wearing the 24 trouser for a couple of years now and I really enjoy them so if you want to check them out for yourself I will link to these along with any discounts Down Below in the description okay back to the video the first time I put on the 990s I could tell that they were built for Comfort but it wasn't until I wore them for a few days and then tried going back to my old shoes that I could really tell the difference like my old shoes just were not comfortable honestly I don't think I'll wear most of these ever again other than two pairs that I'll talk about later these 990 v6s are not like an ultra boost they're not super squishy they do have a little bit of give under your foot but mostly they just feel supportive like there aren't any pressure points that are going to build up and get worse throughout the day they're also roomy enough to accommodate any kind of socks or insoles I've been wearing them with these super feet medium Arch cushion insoles which are much softer than your standard super feet insoles and my feet are feeling pretty good but even without insoles these are still more comfortable than pretty much all of my other shoes speaking of which let's talk about my older shoes I still wear some of them like these Court sneakers from Allen Edmonds I like these because they're a bit roomier and more comfortable than other minimalist low tops like common projects but they're also more premium than like a Stan Smith or Air Force One also wear these atoms which are a lot narrower and more squishy than the Allen Edmonds these are pretty dirty as you can see I've actually tried to clean them and it didn't work so if you don't like dirty shoes maybe don't buy these in white but they have this very soft knit upper so they're very wearable even though they're pretty snug I also put a rigid carbon fiber insole in these which makes the whole shoe less bendy so it take some pressure off the balls of your feet when you walk according to one podiatrist this is good for my feet unfortunately none of my boots have removable insoles even the high-end ones like grantstone yukin I guess it's just a boot thing but it kind of sucks because I really can't wear these right now in fact there's only one other pair of shoes that I'm wearing a lot right now that are just as comfy as the 990s mefisto just kidding the Brooks Adrenaline these are the Adrenaline GTS 23s they're just the latest model that were available when I made the purchase I've actually had several pairs of Brooks in the past specifically the ghost which is like a more minimal running shoe but these adrenaline are much better for my arched feet and my pronated gate I also think these actually look pretty good for Brooks I feel like they just kind of got this colorway right and just like with the 990s I can wear these with an Archer Port insole they have plenty of room super comfortable with pretty much any type of insole but they're also very comfortable right out of the box so throughout the week I'm alternating between Brooks and New Balance sometimes even in the same day and then if I want to dress it up a little bit I'll wear the Allen Edmonds and that brings me to our last Point style I get the 990s or New Balance and general isn't for everybody some people really don't like this aesthetic I'm actually really liking it and I think I'm going to buy more of these in the future but they are chunky maximalist dad shoes they look good with slightly more relaxed outfits I wouldn't try to wear these with skinny jeans they're also pretty casual I wouldn't try to dress these up too much luckily for me casual is all I wear these days and they're definitely more versatile than the Brooks you know the Brooks are very athletic looking I mean they're modern running shoes after all they look awesome with sweats and a crew neck really any athleisure type outfit but I wouldn't wear them with jeans but I am still hunting for comfortable but slightly less sporty slightly less casual Footwear options maybe something like a Birkenstock Boston I don't really know I just know that right now Comfort is my top priority and the 990s and these Brooks are working out really well I want to thank L strange again for sponsoring this video supporting the channel I will link to the 24 trouser Down Below in the description along with any discount codes if you have any suggestions for other comfortable shoe brands or models that I should check out please drop them in the comments below thank you as always for watching and until next time stay stylish,2025-06-23 14:42:46.467195 UTC
ykBGOzBfkhw,New Balance 2002R,in 2021 the new balance two zero zero two r had a lot of steam uh the collaboration space was really good for it obviously this leahey benbery uh joints but also and then probably more importantly is the inline versions of the two zero zero two r had a lot of shine with the protection pack so 2022 i feel like we're gonna see a lot more two zero zero two ours and in this video i have a colorway that i found on their website honestly i was just browsing around trying to find some products and i came across these and i was very interested in seeing how they looked in person price point was only 140 uh shipped so here we have the night tide colorway of the 2002 r and i wanted to give you guys kind of a review and my thoughts on this one let's go ahead and jump in hey what is going on guys here hopefully having a good day out there thank you guys for stopping by and watching if you guys are new to my channel and guys enjoy the content please consider subscribing and this video is actually going to be sponsored by new balance however they didn't tell me anything that i had to say for the specific video or anything like that it's pretty awesome to be able to partner with the brand and have an organic like approach the way that we're able to do so this is the the two zero zero two r i honestly didn't see these before i looked online saw the colorway and i was like it looks kind of dope i definitely want to see them on and more importantly on feet because honestly you get some of these shoes that are just random pairs that just show up on websites versus like a hype collaboration where you see like every angle of every shoe plus all the on feet looks before the release shoes like this that are just kind of a regular pair of sneakers that are sitting on the website and available for you to buy you don't know what they look like on feet for the most part or how they look really up close will the pictures online match the pictures that you get in person and so on so if you actually want to buy a pair of these there is an affiliate link in the description of the video take you over to new balance of site you can buy a pair i would say they fit true to size but i have a little bit of a wider foot some people say two zero zero two rs fit a little bit big but if you have a difference in opinion then leave a comment and let other people know how you feel like the two zero zero two r uh fits but anyway i'll give you some details about the shoot from what new balance of sight says first says this is the two zero zero two r model 139.99 again standard sizing they don't come in wide however i have a wider foot and this fits me just great inspired by our popular mr2002 our 2002 r men's shoe offers a cool callback to the running style of the 2000s the upper of these men's sneakers is crafted with a mix of durable suede and lightweight mesh for a balanced feel impact absorbing midsole and arc support from the stability web technology help to keep your feet comfortable through adventure after adventure as an absorb midsole absorbs impact through the combination of cushioning and compression resistance absorb sbs heel cushioning delivers additional stability and comfort energy provides superior shock absorption and that's pretty much it but i was honestly shocked to see a hundred and forty dollar price point uh considering the suedes on the upper is super nice so that was one of the questions i had for sure because the 992s you could see here i did a review on uh when i got these and the quality of these are absolutely uh butter they're super super nice this is gonna be a great spring summer shoe right here love this colorway uh but this is kind of like a different variation of that obviously it's a completely different model but the price ones are drastically different this one's like 185 i think and this one's 140. so that's a pretty big cost savings but i can tell you in hand honestly the craftsmanship is really nice on these but also the suedes are pretty much exactly the same as the suede they use on the superior like more expensive 992s which i think speaks volumes for the product it's definitely a lot of bang for the buck you'll never see like a nike pair of sneakers for 140 with this type of quality material in fact the jordan retros at like 190 don't have the quality of like craftsmanship and material that some of these things have on them usually uh so it's it's quite impressive honestly what you get one thing i do like unlike the 992s here is that the perforation holes are actually suede as well so you get that across the toe and then on the side panels and around the collar you have two different tones of blue as well it has a kind of the darker color around the shoe for the most part and then it has a little bit of trim in the lighter blue but also behind the end that's kind of embroidered they also have this really light like topaz sort of color that really looks nice in person at first images online kind of made them look pink but when i got them in hand i was like it's actually more of like a kind of like like i said a taupe sort of color like a almost like a tan with a little bit of a pink hue to it it looks really nice though and it flows really nicely with uh the blue on the shoe as well and i did a lace swap leave a comment let me know which lace you like better i went with that tannish pink sort of lace on one and then blue on the other i kind of like that tan pinkish one a little bit better just because it kind of adds a little bit more pop to the shoe but you could really do both of them and they look pretty good you could also just alternate it like i did here and just do one of each i'm kind of weird like that though i like to do that as i was mentioning the fit i would say is true to size and something about this midsole technology it's not anything fancy new or anything like that but it's actually really comfortable nothing like the comfort of like new balance's running side of things where you have like super ultra cush cushioning from the fresh foam x or the like crazy soft squishy responsive fuel cell that stuff is next level comparison to this but for a standard pair of sneakers like you throw on a pair of jordan ones they're hard as a rock you throw on a pair of these and there's some cushion there there's some comfort there that feels good on your feet i'm actually pretty impressed with the cushioning and the the comfort of these just for comparison i have the salih benbery version versus the the baseline version that we got here pretty much the same exact thing the slave member version has a bunch of different crazy upgrades to this one since it is a collaboration so the mesh is super special the nappy suede through the upper is like special as well they actually have a little design in the back also that's special and then salihi benberry's logo on them so this is definitely like a cut above but for what you get for a baseline shoe like this is a nice looking model in my opinion and if new balance continues to bring really nice inline color ways to this model i really think that people are going to love it if you're a fan of any of the 990 models honestly this is one of the models i think you should try out if you haven't thus far uh 2002 r what is it called the 2002 r i honestly don't even know how to pronounce it but very impressed with the quality of the shoe the comfort is there as well it's pretty wide foot friendly and they have a lot of stability going on here as well so this is just one of those great all-around shoes that you can wear and be happy with your decision again if you guys are interested in buying a pair check the link in the description if you've tried a pair of these already in a different colorway leave a comment for other people let them know what do you think is good bad what do you like or dislike about this one because definitely want to see other people's opinions in the comments my view is just my own personal view but every time i see a new colorway of these i'm going to be looking out because this might be my new favorite model i actually might like this one better than the 550s 550s has a little bit more hype on them right now but i like the overall look and comfort of these better than the 550s i think this is just more stylish more of like that retro runner sort of vibe but uh but done in a really good way with some nice materials here anyway that's my thoughts on the uh two zero zero two ours uh leave comments let me know what you guys think and if you guys are new to the channel hit that subscribe button again i have a lot of sneaker content uh primarily that's all this channel is so uh definitely subscribe if you guys are interested more stuff to come and have a good rest of the day alright peace guys,2025-06-23 14:45:44.930267 UTC
-xIXKmTL9Ug,Nike Cortez,in the sneaker world there are a few shoes that stand the test of time the ones that do rise above the noise and become true classics from a quick trend to a staple in order for a shoe to have paramount success it not only needs to be adopted by sneaker enthusiasts but also the general public a perfect example of such sneakers is the one and only the iconic the infamous nike cortez that's right rato the most gangster shoe of all time the nike cortez reaches all the way back to the mid-1960s way before the shoot became closely associated with la gang culture and way before nike was even nike and the company's name was still blue ribbon sports or simply brs brs operated as a us distribution company for the japanese brand onitsuka tiger a brand we know today as asics in 1966 legendary organ track and field coach bill bauerman together with onitsuka tiger designed the predecessor to the cortez the shoe was called the tg24 in 1967 bill bowerman and phil knight decided to change the model name to the tiger mexico you might be thinking to yourself why the hell would they call a shoe made in japan for american consumers mexico well the change in name was motivated by the upcoming 1968 olympic games which was being hosted in mexico bill and phil thought the name to be more market friendly thankfully there was disagreements between brs and onizuka tiger regarding the new name with the olympic games fast approaching they decided to settle on the name aztec inspired by mexican history and the aztec empire hold on just a minute though they changed the name again turns out a german sports company by the name of adidas had some beef with the name it appears that using the aztec moniker on a running shoe was too close to the adidas azteca gold track shoe finally bill bauerman and phil knight decided to call to shoot the cortes inspired by the spanish conquistador hernan cortes who in the 1500s defeated the aztecs in the march on the noctitlan the shoe was received well by serious athletes and more importantly the shoe was a hit with casual runners also known as the jogging movement a movement that bill bowerman helped create it was the number one best-selling shoot in the history of brs and unitsuka tiger but behind the scenes blue ribbon sports and unticka's partnership was deteriorating in 1971 blue ribbon sports officially changed their name to nike and by 1972 nike broke off all ties with onitsuka tiger so who got to keep the rights to the cortez well it was decided that both companies could use the shoe style but only nike got to use the name cortez thanks to the shoe's massive success nike was on the forefront of sporting goods for the first time this gave the company an immense opportunity to establish themselves as a legitimate brand the original model for the shoe was in white leather it had a red swoosh and a blue line in the midsole a few years later nike released a woman's version of the shoe it was called the senorita cortez one day a pair of the senrita cortez arrived for the hollywood actress farah fawcett and she wore them in an episode of charlie's angels check out this scene from the episode where she's skateboarding with cortez is on okay get the instructions the diamonds same time okay okay [Applause] this brought nike wild success and cells went through the roof back in 1976 nike secured their first pro athlete endorsement with steve prefontaine and at one point even had elton john rocking a pair of cortez this was massive exposure for the brand and it perpetuated nike to the forefront of culture and athletic wear in the 1980s the nike cortez was becoming increasingly popular among west coast gangs like the bloods crips ms-13 and many more the gang ms-13 in particular actually adopted the nike cortez as part of their uniform functioning as a sign of allegiance gang members sported the cortes and khaki pants as the official outfit for the gang it is widely known that colors are more than stylistic choices when it comes to gangs like bloods and crips colors are actually used to signal gang affiliation for example bloods wear red and crips wear blue while east coast gangs like the latin kings wear black and gold fast forward to the late 80s and early 90s the rise of gangster rap from the likes of groups like nwa begin to have a huge impact on the popularity of the shoe in the hood the shoes become known as the dope man nikes named after the nwa song dope men the nike cortez was released nationwide and it reached millions but it was the city of los angeles that would identify with the shoe the most in recent years the nike cortez has become less notorious still worn by hip-hop artists and celebrities around the world the cortes continues to be rocked by fashion savvy people and the shoe is constantly being celebrated by la artists like mr cartoon and kendrick lamar both who have their own signature model this year marks the shoe's 46th anniversary the cortez is an iconic shoe that will never stop serving up new colorways many of which go on to become collector's items at various stages in its success the nike cortez has become the official shoe of the jogging movement the streets of los angeles gangs and who knows what's to come there is no doubt that the nike cortez is a foundational piece of footwear's past and future i doubt that these shoes will ever go out of style what do you guys think do you guys like the nike cortez have you ever owned a pair do you still associate it with gang culture please leave a comment below

KWrkm4KVJKQ,on cloudmonster 2,in this video I'm going to be reviewing the on cloud monster 2 because you said I should hello everybody and welcome to 40 runs my name is Chris Ford and I'm a running coach who loves to review Running shoes here on YouTube and today we've got a shoe that's been out a while that you guys recommended I try now I put some polls up on Instagram and on the community Tab and I was asking you about on running shoes and the one shoe that you guys kept saying it was a good shoe I should try it for you is this the cloud monster 2 so here it is and in this video we're going to be talking about things I like things I don't like and whether the on cloud monster 2 is actually a good running shoe okay people so on running shoes like I said in the other video I did are very popular they've got loads of money and they're spending all of that on marketing and the post pandemic running generation new Tik tokers you guys who go to London and join those run clubs are all in on running shoes on have done a fantastic job of pitching these shoes correctly at the Right audience yes they are a fashion shoe but they've become fashionable because on have been very clever in their marketing and you got to take your hat off to that good job on now there is that generation that has come out from the pandemic that got into running through the pmic that's continued to run afterwards and you see them at the races and events and they are in those on running shoes now these shoes aren't cheap This Cloud monster 2 for example it's £170 for a daily trainer it's probably one of the most expensive daily trainers you can buy but it is very popular and the feedback I got from you was very positive so that's why I wanted to give it a try Okay so before we get into the stats and features let's do the disclaimer right so with that out the way let's talk about what's going on here so this is the cloud monster 2 it's 170 it's an easy mile shoe that you can drop a little bit of pace into it's very popular amongst you guys like I said who are looking for that you know non-plated daily trainer with a little bit of Stack you've got the Dual density helon midso we've got 35 mil of stack in the hill and 29 front that's a 6 mil drop we've got a nylon blend speedboard and apparently and I don't know this but it has increased weight versus the first version now talking away let's stick it on the scales 304 Grand in my UK 9 a half which fits true to size now if you've never seen an on-running shoe before you got the cloud Tech you got these pods here running along the shoe now they have changed the design slightly on some of the newer shoes but they've maintained the traditional cloudtech design on this now like I said this is that easy Miler that you can drop a little bit of pace into that sort of recovery shoe that you could probably then go out and do six miles and drop a little bit of Target Pace in it is a daily trainer but it is is a built up daily trainer and a very expensive daily trainer you do have this nylon speedboard running through the shoe which I think you need because I think it would be incredibly unstable if you didn't in terms of the ride it's a bit of a strange experience when you start out on it but it does work well the Foams work well you know this dual setup worked well with the Nyon PL and I get what you guys are saying you can Cruise about in it and do a lot of stuff in the shoe the out soole on the shoe is not brilliant and I've had that before on other on- running shoes that I've owned I wouldn't say it's a fun shoe but it is an easy shoe to get on with Okay so let's do the likes I might have already spoken about some of them but let's do the likes and the dislikes so the likes I like the upper I like the laces I like the idea that I'm now cool because I'm in on running shoes and I like the fact that I can now do Tik Tok videos and also like the fact that I can now dress in black and turn up to any run Club in London and I'm going to fit right in now I'm joking but I I genuinely do like the fact that this is fashionable I like to have you know all different shoes on this channel and I like the fact that this thing is taking off and I like the fact that on are getting popular I think that's a good thing okay so let's move on to the dislikes so one big dislike with on running shoes and this is unfair to this Sho it's not doing it yet but I've had this in other on running shoes that I've had and I've seen it in the comments on those posts I made this at some point will begin to squeak now I don't know why that is and don't know whether honor were aware of it but their shoes seem to squeak after a while and it's a real shame because uh the shoes up to that point are really good but anyway that is going to come and you got to be aware of that and it's weird that that happens anyway in terms of other dislikes the price £170 is a lot of money now I appreciate this is being pitched as a a premium shoe it is a fashion shoe I get all that you know you can look good in the pair of jeans or whatever they say with it I get all that but £170 is very hard to justify when you can get some very good running shoes for a lot cheaper so that's the main dislike but look to sum it up I've been pleasantly surprised by the cloud monster 2 you guys are usually never wrong and the cloud monster 2 has been a good shoe I've enjoyed it you know I have to say and I'm really pleased the fact that you know I'm now cool and all that sort of stuff and it has surprised me so thank you for recommending it I am dreading the moment that it becomes squeaky but hopefully fingers cross it doesn't but yeah I I think the cloud monster 2 you know it's it's actually a good shoe you know it's I can't I can't recommend it cuz £170 is a lot of money but if you don't mind spending that and you want to be fashionable and all that kind of stuff then knock yourself out you know there's nothing here that I have found to like really dis like so there we go people a positive on running review at 40 runs so I would say let me know in the comments but you already have told me what you think of the cloud monster 2 now I know some of you will disagree with this and you will say it's a fashion shoe and all that kind of stuff and I get that I get the fact that it's £170 I can't sit here and recommend it to you honestly I can't because there are so many good shoes that you can get a lot cheaper but if you've got that money and you want to be like I don't know fashionable and down with the kids and you like on running shoes then great you know there's nothing wrong there you know yes it will squeak at some point Point hopefully this one doesn't but you know it I can't sit here and justify £170 to you but

hF4Ec20tmqs,Nike Dunk Panda,in this video we are going to be reviewing the nike dunk low black and white to see what the hype is all about these shoes have been going for over three times retail lately hey what's going on my name is chris ross and on this channel i like to review men's shoes and clothes that sort so if that is something you are interested in go ahead and hit that subscribe button and without further ado let's get to the mean potatoes first things first let's start off with the price now dunk lows usually retail for a hundred dollars to about 120 for some special edition it's the resale market where things start to get nutty and obviously there are so many different colorways and variations of these shoes the resale market can go for as low as 60 all the way up to the seventeen to two thousand dollars even three thousand dollars for some of the travis scott but these specifically are going for around the 300 maybe down to the 250 mark if you can find them at the right time and that is going to differ on what size shoe you wear even seeing some of the infant shoes in this specific colorway going for a hundred dollars infant shoes going for a hundred dollars those kids don't care what they're wearing nike has said that they expect to do a few more drops of these shoes over the next year or so so expect for prices to start to slowly go down especially after the hype dies down as well if you do want some dunks and you want to go a little bit cheaper for whatever reason the highs are going for a lot less than the low so if you want to save a little bit go with the highs over the lows or rather than the lows you know what i mean these do fit true to size crazy nike got sizing right i will say that there isn't much space for your toes on the side but there is a little bit of extra head room in there so you got some wiggle room up and down but not so much side to side if you know what i mean and for your wife feet people out there i do think you will be fine with buying regular size shoes i haven't seen them offered in a wide sizing yet but as i said before i think you should be good with just going with the regular shoes before making this video i did watch a few other reviews on these shoes and in the comments on one video i saw someone ask if these were okay running shoes and absolutely not are these running shoes that's that's pretty much all i gotta say about that these are good to bust out here and there maybe a once a week but i wouldn't even recommend these as a daily shoot i would rather wear air force ones or blazers over these as a daily yeah i said blazer and here's why the comfort and material it's been a common complaint with this specific release that these feel plastic and that's the case with mine as well these are going to take a few weeks to break in not a few days but a few weeks probably like two to three if not longer just the size feels so stiff i don't know what it is about this leather i tried to find a specific source to find if this was real leather or if it was synthetic like it just feels that plasticky but i couldn't verify it and from what i could see before it's supposedly real leather the only hint that makes me think that this is real leather is that the black leather around the laces actually has lit slight blue tint to it which makes me think that it's a chrome tan leather but i'm not a leather expert that sounds like a rose anvil thing it does have a full eva insole so there's a lot of support there and the midsole and the outsole are all full of rubber from what i can tell so that's probably one of the other reasons why it's stiff and takes a while to break in because that's a lot of rubber to bend since we're on the topic of the soles you do have full stitching all the way around the shoe for the soles which is always a good sign and it's probably going to last you a long time if you take care of them and since we're on that topic of cushioning the cushioning around the ankle is okay it's stiff kind of firm i'm not like dang this is super soft or anything like that it's it's there the tongue is also pretty thin and it doesn't have much cushioning on it it's not really that big of a deal but it's just something i thought it might know it's a great looking shoe but it just feels cheaply made i can't lie so i hope that review was helpful for you guys and deciding if you do want to go ahead and pull the trigger on these or you just want to wait or get something different for more reviews just like this on shoes clothes and other stuff go ahead and hit that subscribe button and as always i will see you in the next one,2025-06-23 14:49:36.336307 UTC

LgWUOy01Pmo,Nike Air Max 90,in today's video we are going to be breaking down the differences between the air max 1 and the air max 90. there are definitely a lot of people out there that get these two sneakers confused and i want to make sure that i help you understand the difference between the two and why both sneakers are so iconic and how you can't go wrong buying either one and if you did not know by now my name is dj and this is the dna show so like typical fashion you know we got to talk about the history first then we talk about styles cuts materials similarities all those fancy things so let's get into it going all the way back to 1987 tinker hatfield designed the air max one and this shoe created a lot of controversy within the industry tinker hatfield was originally an architectural design artist brought on to nike to work on the buildings not the sneakers now most people think that the air max 1 was the first sneaker the nike introduced with the air unit in it but that is incorrect the tailwind was the original sneaker that came out from nike in 1979 and even though the tailwind created a little buzz within the industry the regular consumer simply just didn't know that much about it because they couldn't see the air unit and that's where tinker's creativity came with the nike air max one showing the air unit on the side of the foot this was something that had never been seen before and i'm telling you right now it changed the game so after the air max one had released in 1987 we then saw the air max 90 come out which was almost like a big brother version or more poofy version if you want to call it that's what i always say i feel like the air max 90 is a little bit more poofier than this which we'll get into in a bit but the air max 90 came out in 1990 and just like other sneakers or movies or you name it typically you're gonna have similarities between something when you have a first version a second version a third version and you see the evolution over time and i think these two sneakers are prime examples of that you have the og first version and the second version coming out behind it looks pretty similar to the og but it's got its own character to it so now that you guys know a little bit of history about these sneakers let's go ahead and break these things out starting from the outsoles working our way up talking about styles cuts materials and all those fancy things so starting with the outsole as you can see with these two side by side they definitely look very very similar just based off of the pattern and the shape and the flow of the two outsoles now going up to the midsole it's gonna be the same type of thing when it comes to the overall shape and flow of it it is definitely similar as well but the air max 90 has its own hit of character with the additional color in the middle of the midsole housing the air unit on the air max one you have two small grooves on the front end of the foot and you have two indented lines that go all the way around the midsole now with the air max 90 you have an entirely smooth midsole and then the only indented lines you have multiple here again on the same kind of area housing the air unit looking at the air units these both look visually identical but when it comes to the actual air unit on the sneaker the air max 90's bubble is a lot bigger than the air max one which some may say creates more comfort when it comes to this sneaker which causes people to really love the air max 90 but i have definitely heard multiple reviews from people saying that they like the air max 1 comfort and fit as well and if you ask everybody as a whole i think they're gonna say they like either one just because they're both comfortable which we'll talk about a little bit later in the video because i posted some polls on ig to see what everybody thinks about which one is fire and trash and which sneaker people actually like the most so stick around to the end of the video to see those results now taking it to the upper of the shoe there is one very very important thing that you guys need to know you gotta hit the like button because that helps the algorithm oh so much not but for real though if you look at these two uppers you're definitely going to see a lot of similarities when you put the two shoes side by side for example you got your suede nubuck type of material here on the front end with your mesh on the toe and then the same type of material here on the eyelets going to the top of the shoe around the laces and everything like that but again you have your plastic vibes right here with the same lines kind of mirroring your midsole on the air max 90. so i think for me when i see the air max 90 or the air max one the easiest telltale between the two is always looking at that midsole and the plastic tips here on the front end of the shoe and then just the overall bulkiness of the sneaker is a lot easier for me to tell if it's the air max 90 or if it's air max one now looking at the overall flow of the sneaker when it comes to the profile shot and the color blocking on how they play this these are two original colorways this is the og white and red colorway and this is the og infrared colorway so i wanted to make sure that i used these colorways in particular because obviously yes there's a bunch of different sneakers that have a bunch of different colorways and the color blocking patterns are slightly different based off of that but i think these two are prime examples simply because these are replicating the og versions so like i was saying looking at the side of the sneaker where the swoosh lies as you can see the nike swiss is raised a little bit higher and you can see a lot more of the swoosh compared to this one is kind of cut in half at the bottom end and cut off more on the top end as well it's showing yes there is a swoosh within there but you have a big kind of mud guard side panel piece that goes along there where the black leather strip is at and similar to the plastic infrared piece right here around the lace holes you have the same thing with the air max branding right here within the black leather piece as well so seeing that is going to be another indicator that this is definitely air max 90 because this does not have that branding on the sneaker at all the only area on the air max one that actually states air max is going to be on the tongue you have a square tongue with nike and then it says air max just below that and then when you go to the tongue on the infrared you have a square tongue nike with air max below that now going to the back end of the sneakers as you can see as well the air max 90 is gonna have a lot more bulkier vibe and you're gonna have that same plastic piece on the back that match with the front and the side end of the shoe compared to the stitched air max branding on the back end of the air max 1. sock liners and insoles are going to be essentially the same when it comes to that with your nike air branding on the insoles so hopefully looking at those side by side shots and seeing the differences when it comes to the details and the overall shape and flow of the sneakers you can see yes they definitely came from the same type of designer but he gave him a different twist when it came to the 90 compared to the air max one me personally i have a hard hard time picking which one i like the most so i took this post to ig to see what everybody else thinks about these two sneakers as well if you haven't already make sure you follow me on ig so you can participate in the polls and see all the results here on the channel first question was is the air max 1 fire or trash this is what they said 83 of the people chose fire and 17 of the people chose trash and i completely understand it this is a very iconic model now the air max 90 on the other hand this is definitely a very iconic model but at the same time it's just not the og the og typically always wins so let's see what the people think eighty percent of the people chose fire and twenty percent of the people chose trash this might actually be a pretty good battle seeing which model people like the most and as you can see right here the air max one wins with 58 so overall that tells me a lot of people still like the air max 90 but they like the air max one just a little bit more me personally i'm gonna tell you guys my results when it comes to the toe down look the overall feel and just how i feel like when i'm rocking the shoe i like the air max one because it has a lot more sleeker vibe to it doesn't feel too poofy not too big not like a sb type sneaker when it comes to the overall ankle and the padding it's a lot thicker on here when it comes to the tongue and when it comes to the side end of the foot so when i'm looking at the shoe on the toe down i definitely feel like my shoe is a lot more clunky with the air max 90 even when i look at the midsole and different things like that now don't get me wrong i love rocking the air max 90 it feels really good it looks great with outfits but i think the air max one just looks a little bit better so let me know how you

kRkR0VUwaOA,Reebok Club C 85 Vintage shoes,in today's video we're going to be reviewing the reebok club c85 vintage to help you decide if it deserves a spot in your closet or wherever you keep your shoes on the shelf or on the floor let's go hey what's going on my name is chris ross another channel i like to make content around men's shoes clothes and grooming products as a whole so if that's something you're interested in go ahead and hit that subscribe button i've been wearing this shoe for a few weeks now and i've got some things to tell you let's start off with something that's important to everyone the sizing and the fit now when i first put these on they didn't quite feel like they fit that is they were snug on the sides especially in the toe box area but i got mine in na9 and that's because everywhere i looked it said that if it's true the size which for the most part is true they do fit true to size but it's almost like an exact fit it is a very narrow shoe so for all you wide-footed people out there you might want to take that into consideration whenever you are going to buy this shoe the best way i've seen it described is they fit a lot like vans it's a really narrow shoe and the toe box is kind of pointed so it squeezes your toes a little bit now i personally prefer a little bit of wiggle room in my shoes and i do wish i would have went a half size up just to give me that little bit extra room but i'm actually fine with just the nine for now if you do like that extra space then go ahead and go a half size up on a side note these look like orthopedic shoes i'm not i can't stop seeing it whenever i look at it i see orthopedics even though i did say that these run narrow in the toe box that's not to say that these are not comfortable so we went grocery shopping the other day not like oh just pick up a few things grocery shopping but like grocery shopping to where you don't want to go back to the grocery store for at least three or four months because of how bad of an experience it was grocery shopping but we did spend a solid two hours walking around the grocery store and i could say that i probably could have done another two hours walking around in these shoes these things are super comfortable the shoe sits fairly low below the ankle so there isn't a bunch of rubbing and stuff like that on your ankle or your achilles that's always a plus in my book the break-in time is virtually zero and that's mainly because of the leather and i'll let you know why in just a bit the insole is about a quarter inch thick and it features an eva a sponge and french terry cloth now if you don't know what eva is it's pretty much this like firm foam material that's that they feature in a lot of insoles and midsoles for shoes since we're on the subject of the insole it has the reebok brand on there but it's like faded and kind of worn when you get them to kind of play on the vintage sink which i really thought was a really cool detail there are also patches of foam on the inside where your arch and the opposite side of your arch sit so there's a little bit of extra cushion there as well and it does help a lot and reebok actually took it a step further to give you terry cloth around your ankle so it's really soft around your ankle and there's a lot of cushioning and pad in between that we actually look at the sole right here so this is this rubber it's a really nice rubber it's pretty soft actually too and you can see right here is this exposed eva this is that eva i was talking about before it's firm but soft that's the best way i can explain it and if you slap all that together the insole this midsole and then your rubber outsole you get a pretty comfortable shoe the tongue even has a little bit of tear cloth on it and it's got a thick foam in there wrapped in nylon maybe they thought this was just gonna be like you know what maybe we'll just make this an orthopedic shoe for real i i'm sorry i can't shake it yes the reebok close c85s do come in at 80 that's correct that's what lily wanted you to know so in comparison to shoes that you may be looking at like the air force ones the new balances or even a pair of vans these and 80 dollars sit right in the middle you end up getting a pair of shoes that'll probably last you over the years and i say that because of things like for instance the soles are stitched and glued on the cream colorway usually ages really well because when they do get dirty they're off white so they don't get that dingy look to them because they kind of already are and not only that these vintage base shoes just like chuck taylors and even nike blazers they have that old look to them so as they wear it kind of just goes with the theme of the shoe i mentioned leather earlier and the leather used here is actually a chrome tan leather which isn't anything special because they're used on other shoes all the time but what you need to know about it is that the leather on these is actually really really soft especially compared to those other shoes that i mentioned before i don't know what they did or how they did it to get the leather this soft straight from the factory but it doesn't have that plasticky feel that chrome tan leather usually has and since this is an all leather upper that's what gives you that kind of zero week break in time which i was talking about earlier cool so if you get a pair definitely just take a second to rub the leather and compare them to another pair of shoes that you have that are in the same price range and you'll feel the difference now if you don't want to spend the full 80 and you want to feel like you got a deal then if you shop around a little bit you can probably find these for five to ten dollars off dsw had them for i think 75 packs on at 75 and maybe some other places will have them in that 70 range but you're just gonna have to catch it but outside of that i don't think the price is gonna vary that much and that is depending on the colorway which reminds me there are a few things that you definitely need to know before you buy these some things you need to know if you're looking for a casual shoe to change it up from the regular chuck taylor vans air force ones common projects boom here you go this has pretty much effectively shelves my air force ones for the foreseeable future honestly i'm really not sure why these aren't more popular than they are right now because everyone is already dressing like vintagey and all that other stuff especially if you like that 80s early 90s kind of look these go great with i've been watching these doing a little bit of market research and the search for these has hit an all-time high within the last month so i wouldn't be surprised if these just became wildly popular out of nowhere this is a very light shoe sometimes that's a concern for people so just so you know also this sole although it looks thick it really isn't that thick so you're only going to get about an inch of height with these if that is something that you're concerned about if you want this off-white colorway technically the colorway is chalk paper white you have to get the vintage there are actually three different variations of the club c85 there's the regular ones there's the vintage and then there's the tvs the tvs are actually the most expensive they retail for 90 and i think the regular ones are 10 cheaper than this the vintage and the tvs are very similar uh there are a few differences i think the leather is a little bit different the material on the insole is a little bit different there may be one or two other things to it between these and the regulars one of the biggest differences is the profile of the shoe these are a lot flatter and the top is a lot thinner and more narrow as to where the regular 85 c's have a more rounded toe box and the side profile is a lot more rounded as well now go ahead and click up in the corner if you want to know how to style these too and if it's not up immediately after then just go ahead and subscribe hit that notification button so then you can know as soon as it comes up and then you'll be ready to be like i'm out here i'm ready and as always guys i will see you in the next one,2025-06-19 08:38:04.998048 UTC
7EP0yCy4DXI,Converse Chuck Taylor All Star,it was going on guys alright today I'm going to be talking to you about the converse men's Chuck Taylor All Star core aux these are the white sneakers obviously while these are the men's version I've always seen these as like completely unisex shoes so whoever you are you know these shoes are great for men or women alike so yeah this is the new style white Chuck Taylors I know for before they used to have essentially they've changed the logo a little bit which is only really the main difference now you can see they have the converse logo on the tongue along with the all-star and then also on the back they've changed it so they have the all-star logo with the converse as well so really the converse has just been added to both of those logos that's really the only main difference other than that yeah they're just pretty much your you know your standard pair they've you know these these types of shoes have really been I think staple for summer shoes for quite a while I think they may have went out out of style for a few years but they're definitely coming back I'm seeing them a lot more I think you know I think because I really love converse these ones in particular a really nice color detailing you have the red stripe that goes right along the outside all the way to the back and all the way around as well as a blue stripe that does the same thing and you also have you know the nice like rubber front soles up here which are you know your standard in converse and overall they're just a really really nice light and thin shoe I mean even like you know the canvassing is really really nice and thin throughout and it's much I feel like better for summer in that way because when you compare it to heavier shoes and I know I wear a little bit heavier shoes in the winter fans or air maxes or even boots and so to have you know an alternative that's just really thin and nice and light and breathable especially when it gets hot out here I mean I live in California and so it gets you know pretty hot during the summer so that's really really nice to have in terms of the actual you know style and what they go well with I honestly believe these go well with anything I'm not this shorts guy I don't wear shorts a lot of wear jeans in which all the time I think I'm only only pretty much own black jeans and so these are great with those they're great with you know blue jeans girlfriend also has a pair of these she wears them with you know blue jeans her shorts whatever so they really really go well with with anything they're also very complimentary with white t-shirts and things like that I wear a lot of white tees and so you know it's they're kind of a nice complement to that one thing you've probably noticed as I've been spinning these around is and I just got these a little over a month ago a do get dirty fast so you know you do have to take time I probably will within the next like week or so and things start to settle down it's definitely like you know cleaning the canvas is I think like the most important part cuz you want to keep them nice and shiny and they do attract a lot of dirt especially being white shoes so if you're someone who's you know constantly hiking or like I'm you know doing a lot of outdoor stuff and and want to use these for that I would definitely not recommend it because they will pick up a lot of dirt I did however clean off the rubber points right up here pretty easy usually you can just take something like it like a wet life and just kind of you know scrub off any little scuff marks that's pretty easy but for the canvas yeah you need to like wash it or really go and there with like a toothbrush or something along those lines and really scrub it off but yeah as for the size ease have a nice fit although converse I think typically just run small and that's just always been a thing so I would definitely recommend going a half-size up at least or a nine and a half I got these in a ten and they fit perfectly so what keep that in mind as for their comfort Congress I don't think I've ever really prided themselves on having good support I know they've tried to kind of you know market that people we're changing in there we're making our shoes so that they have better support but I still believe these are you know they're pretty flat footed shoes you know that's one thing that you know if you're looking for something to run in or again do like physical activity with like hiking or suchlike I would definitely not wear these you know and they're comfortable they're comfortable to like kick back in and walk around or whatever like you know do easy tasks and but if you're going for long walks I mean I've definitely had no longer days like at school or at work or whatever and I've been wearing these and they do get uncomfortable after a while so you know another thing you should keep in mind especially if you're a flat-footed person like I am or maybe you just have like really wide feet these can get pretty uncomfortable if you're wearing them for long periods of time in like extraneous activity other than that yeah commerce I mean these you know these new Chuck Taylors it's all stars they're they're awesome they they last forever they really do this is like a third pair I've had and the other reason is just because I totally

QxC-fF7mwGQ,Onitsuka Mexico 66,it's about that time of year for a brand new pair of sneakers today we're unboxing the onitsuka tiger shoes the original Kill Bill ones here I am just following the trends so let's open them and see what they look like you know the drill let's see if the sizing is accurate so for reference I got these shoes on stockx and they are the onitsuka tiger Mexico 66 Kill Bills in yellow and black and they were 168 but with taxes and shipping and processing fees they came out to $212 so yeah not a cheap shoe and now for the grand reveal wow all right so this is the shoe comes with a little tag and this little thing which I'm going to cut off um I got a size so according to the website this is a unisex size 5 and 1/2 and a women's size 7 I am a size seven so that's why I went with this size it is looking a little bit big so far they are um supposed to be 100% leather so they're supposed to be very durable and will possibly stretch out if they're leather oh I always wondered what this little flap was and it's to help you put them on actually cuz they're pretty tight all right you know the drill I got to put them both on and I got to walk around my apartment let's cut these bad boys off and they are actually really comfy I they feel cushiony and then I feel some good art support Arc support or arch support I'm a seven these feel like a pretty true size seven I guess there's just a little bit of room but not enough to size down like I definitely feel like I got the right size so if you're a women's size s make sure you go for the women's size 7 it's pretty true to size and for sizing purposes I always like to compare another one of my shoes for you guys just in case I have these Nike Air Max and I am a size 7 and 1 half in these actually so um just in comparison if you have a pair of Nike shoes um and you are a 7 and 1 half in them and they fit you well then I'd say go for a seven in the onitsuka Tigers I also have a pair of Solomons and these are a size 7 and women as well and these fit me o o they are nasty well these fit me great so yes I'd say that this is a pretty true to size seven um I'd go with that size if you're a size seven one thing to keep in mind when you're shopping for these shoes which I didn't know until my friend pointed it out to me is that they have three different types of these yellow Kill Bill ones they have three different versions um so this is one of the versions and then the other one actually has a black stripe so this white area is going to be black and then this black in the back is going to be yellow so they have that and then they have one more they all look super similar like you really have to um look at the details to see what the difference is I like these ones with the white stripe that's why I went for these but they all look so similar like honestly you can't really tell that much of a difference unless you're really looking yeah very lightweight leather so it's really a great shoe I'm thinking it's going to last me a long time I do really love the way they look dirty honestly more than they look clean so I'm going to try and dirty them up real quick all right that is a wrap on these shoes I'm super excited to wear them and to pair some fun outfits with them I think that even though that they're super bright yellow I do feel like it's a pretty neutral shoe and that it does go with a lot and also you could wear it with like a really basic outfit and then it makes your outfit pop so that's why I really like them and I look forward to styling them um see you in the next video like And subscribe and B filter water Stanley Cups for all my girls who drinking Stanley Cups for all my girls who drinking water water water Valley SSA water Stanley Cups for all my girls who drinking water,2025-06-23 14:44:48.720039 UTC
vxUG8kfCiYg,New Balance 990,it's crazy to think that one of the shoes that I've been looking forward to most this year is a widely available gr new Palance and I've got to say it didn't disappoint what's up everybody I'm Seth Fowler and today I'm reviewing the brand new New Balance 990 V6 if you're looking to grab a pair of the new Balan 990 v6s they officially released on November 4th for a retail price of 200 bucks which yes unfortunately is $15 price increase over the new Balan 990 v5s however that should release back in 2019 and in 2022 we're going through some pretty insane inflation and I'm sure material prices are more expensive than they used to be so I'm not surprised by the price increase but at the same time it is a little disappointing all that said though in my opinion even though this shoe is $200 I do think this is a shoe that's absolutely worth $200 so if you've been watching my channel for a while you know that over the last couple years I've become a really big fan of New Balance and that's mainly because they've always made really great shoes even though they've not always been the most popular sneaker among sneaker heads they've always had consistently good material quality and construction and overall product and I feel like they're finally getting the attention that they deserve from not only the runner Community but also the Sneakerhead community and I think this shoe is a perfect example of that this shoe while yes is a running shoe and definitely features that sort of dad shoe aesthetic it's actually a shoe that I think a lot of sneakerheads will also really love because of how great of an overall shoe it actually is like I said at the beginning of this video I've been heavily anticipating this shoe for the last 6 months to a year and that's because I love new balance's 990 line which is one of their most iconic and popular sneaker lines of all time the 990 V5 which originally released back in 2019 has become one of my most worn sneakers that I've ever owned I wear this shoe almost every single day not only because it's very comfortable on foot but also it's one of those shoes that can be both a running shoe and also just an everyday lifestyle shoe and that's one of the things that I love about the 990 line it was originally designed as a running sneaker line it still serves as a really great everyday running sneaker but it's also an incredibly comfortable shoe that you can throw on with pretty much anything and both Runners and Casual wearers alike can find things that they love about any of the 990 sneakers in the 990 line and that's why I love this line so much it's one of the most versatile and well-rounded sneaker lines in my opinion of all time and up until recently the New Balance 990 V3 one of the older sneakers in the line has been my favorite pair of New Balance 990s which is kind of crazy to say because this shoe is absolutely not as teched out or spec out as a 990 V5 however in my opinion it's a great combination of both comfort and style however I'm not going to lie I think the New Balance 990 V6 may have replaced the 990 V3 as my favorite 990 which is crazy but I think it's true before we dive into the reasons why I think the 990 V6 is the best 990 sneaker of all time let's first take a look at the box so if you're familiar with New Balance boxes and in particular the 990 boxes you know that this box is a little bit different from some of the previous models usually they come with an American flag on the top and say made in the USA and while this shoe is still technically made in the United States in fact they do say that on the box they switched out the design design on the top of the box for a much more plain and simple New Balance logo in dark gray on top of a lighter gray actually it's the same exact Castle Rock colorway that you find on the shoe itself and it makes me wonder for different colorways of the shoe are they going to switch out the colorway on the box I don't know doesn't really matter either way but I like the color a lot and then on the front of the Box you've got the size tag I grabbed a size n which is my true size we will talk about sizing later on in the video but that's pretty much all you get with the Box unfortunately I don't believe that you get any other color laces which I guess is kind of the norm for sneakers like this so it's not too surprising but for2 bucks wouldn't have minded another color set of laces but getting back into the sneaker itself let's dive into the materials that make up the 990 V6 so while The Styling on the upper of this shoe has changed from previous 990 models the materials seem to be relatively consistent around the edge of the toe of the sneaker you've got this really nice light gray suede that makes up the mudguard I've always loved the suede that they used on the 990 lines it's one of those details and materials that makes this line really what it is I know it's subtle I know it's simple but it really does Define the 990 if you think of the 990 line you think of a shoe that's covered in Gray Suede and I love that about it moving up from the gray suede you get to another iconic 990 material and that's this gray mesh that's on the toe and actually runs all the way around the upper of the sneaker sort of hidden on the medial side of the toe you've got this nice reflective detail which in normal light just looks like a gray panel but when you're running in this shoe at night or maybe someone takes a picture of this shoe with the flash you really see this detail pop and I really like that little subtle Accent on either side of the toe box you've got these dark gray perforated panels which almost look like the skeleton of the shoe and I think really add a nice aesthetic detail to the sneaker As you move up on the shoe you you find another reflective detail at the bottom of the tongue with a new balance logo in the center of it and then on either side of the tongue you've got these light gray suede ey stays weaving through the ey St you've got these flat white laces which I think do contrast the upper of the shoe really nicely and of course tie in no pun intended really nicely with the midsole of the shoe then underneath the laces you've got more of that mesh material that you found on the toe on the bottom half of the tongue and as you move to the top half of the tongue the mesh changes to more of like a a gray meshy style fabric kind of like that mesh you find on sport shorts and at the top of the tongue you've got this large new Balan 990 V6 logo patch now one thing I'm noticing about the 990 v6s tongue when compared to like the 990 v5s or even the 990 v3s the tongue itself seems to be a little bit less padded than the 990 v5s not a lot it's not very noticeable and I only actually noticed it when I was holding these two shoes side by side walking in the shoe running in the shoe I didn't notice it at all I will say that probably because there's less padding this tongue is more flexible than the tongue on the 99 V5 which might have been on purpose it might actually fit to your foot better and move with your foot better so that might have been the reason why they did that I definitely still feel like there's ample padding in the tongue of this shoe like it's not going to feel uncomfortable whatsoever but it is a different feel and one that I don't know if I prefer but I also just don't mind moving inside the sneaker you've got this light gray sock liner which is pretty soft to the touch feels very similar to the 990 v5s and just like with the 990 v5s the ankle area of this shoe is incredibly well padded and unlike the tongue it doesn't feel like they took out any padding so that's a good thing moving inside the shoe you've got this black foam insole with the New Balance running logo printed on the heel in white the insole is pretty soft but not incredibly thick you actually get most of your cushion from the midsole itself but now let's get into sizing and fit of the new Balan 990 V6 so like I said earlier in the video I grabb this shoe in my true size a size 9 now with previous New Balance 990 models I did grab those shoes a half size down I went down to a size eight and half because I felt like those shoes were a little bit long and a little bit wide and I know it sounds like I'm getting a shoe that's too big for me and especially with the New Balance 9990 V5 I felt like this shoe just felt big overall however with the 990 V6 I grabbed this shoe in my true size the size and honestly it fits me fine it does run a tad long and I probably could have gone down half a size and I've heard a lot of people recommending to go down half a size I personally love the way this shoe fits me true to size which is kind of frustrating because I'm not sure exactly how to recommend this shoe to you guys do you want to grab it true to size do you want to grab it down a half size I'm not really sure this is one of those shoes that I think you really need to try on before you buy it I mean honestly you probably would be fine just going true to size in this shoe I don't think you'd have any issues but if you're looking for a very true one toone fit you should try the shoe on first before you bu it because I don't know if this shoe is going to fit you true to size or if it's going to fit you slightly big so really the best thing to do is go into your local newbound store or maybe Foot Locker whenever the shoe does release in Foot Locker try the shoe on first before you buy it and just make sure that you're grabbing the right size for you because $200 is a lot of money to spend on a pair of sneakers and you want to make sure it fits also a bonus of all the 990 sneakers they all come in different widths like you can grab a regular width of this shoe you can grab a large width or a small width really no matter what your foot shape is you can find a pair of 990 v6s that fit you also if you're trying to increase the comfort of these shoes or really any shoe I definitely recommend checking out my sock brand Apothecary which you may have already noticed on foot in the on foot portions of this video we make incredibly comfortable socks that look great with your sneakers and if you guys want to check them out for yourself I've made sure to leave a link in the top of the description below and in my opinion our blue Essentials socks look great with these new balance 990 v6s continuing back in the shoe to the midfoot you've got more of that gray mesh that we talked about earlier some more of that suede that I absolutely love and of course in the center of the midfoot you've got the reflective New Balance endload this time around in sort of a call back to the 990 V3 the end logo is actually surrounded by this white piping which I absolutely love and it really makes the logo stand out on the side of the sneaker just behind that you've got some more reflective paneling as well as a reflective hit right here on the top eyelets of the shoe and then towards the heel of the shoe on the lateral side you've got the 990 logo and then moving around to the heel of the shoe you've got some more reflective hits some more of that really nice suede you've got the New Balance logo and just below that you've got made in the USA and actually that's the only place that I can see on the outside of the shoe that features the made in the USA brand which is interesting because on the 990 V5 actually had an American flag on the tongue which to be fair made the tongue a little bit stiffer than I think it needed to be but they definitely show that off a lot more on the previous shoe now according to New Balance their maid line which this shoe is a part of has a domestic value of 70% which means 70% of this shoe was either made or constructed in the United States or maybe 70% of the materials were made in the United States it's honestly kind of vague as to what that means but either way a good portion of this shoe was made in the United States again I don't know if that means constructed or the materials were made in the United States States I have no idea but either way it's part of their maid line and new balance is pretty proud of that and one thing I've got to say about new balance's maid line is that all the shoes that are part of the maid line tend to be really great quality sneakers the construction is really nice the materials feel really nice not that their other shoes aren't as nice there's just something that feels a little bit more premium about these shoes and I think it's probably because it costs them a lot more to make these shoes so they're probably making sure that the QC is a lot better on these shoes I mean honestly New Balance tends to have better QC than most other brands in the market anyway so their maid line is like the top of the top and I feel like they really do a great job of making really high quality shoes and that's one of the reasons why I love New Balance so much and as you can probably tell the New Balance 990 V6 is no exception this is a very well-made shoe and again for 200 bucks I would hope that that was the case then moving down on the shoe you get to one of the largest changes between the 990 V6 and any of the previous 990 models and that's this brand new midsole which even just aesthetically I love I think it's a beautifully sculpted midsole not only is the shape of this midsole different it's a lot more modern feeling and honestly the shape of this shoe is a lot more organic that seems to be ort of the trend that sneaker fashion is going in much more organic and almost natural looking pairs of shoes I mean look at the foam Runner it looks like it was grown from a tree but also the materials put in this midsole are different so one of the biggest changes between this midsole and the previous midsole is the fact that this midsole features fuel cell foam which I love because it's a very soft cushion and it's also very responsive underf foot now this shoe is not as cushy or as soft as something like the New Balance 1080 V12 or anything like that but it is definitely softer than the New Balance 990 V5 or any of the previous models now I will say that this is not like a Max cushion shoe like Nike react or adidas Boost or anything like that but honestly I feel like it's a perfect mix between some like really soft cushion and also some very stable firm cushioning like it's right in the middle it's actually a really great sort of everyday cushion that I think is probably one of their best cushions yet I mean I'm not going to lie I love very pillowy cushiony shoes but those aren't the kind of shoes that you can wear every single day and honestly I don't really like running in those shoes because I feel like I'm losing a lot of energy really falling into the material the way that those shoes can have you sort of fall into this shoe the 990 V6 still feels very responsive you still do get a lot of good cushion but it's not too much cushion I feel like they really found the perfect balance and that's one of the reasons why I love this shoe so much it's a really great running and Casual shoe for a lot of people out there in addition to the fuel cell found in the midsole of this shoe you also have endcap which is a slightly stiffer cushion it's also coated or covered in a slightly stiffer material to provide a lot of stability in the heel which is much appreciated because fuel cell is very soft and the end cap kind of balances everything out I mean overall the New Balance 990 V6 is an incredibly comfortable shoe you've got this really well patted upper which is still pretty breathable as well as this very soft but still stable midsole and one thing I really like about this midsole is that they've increased the size of it so it gives it a much more chunky look which aesthetically I love and I actually really like that sort of very slight rocker feel that it gives you when you're walking or running in the shoe it makes transitioning into your next step very very easy but then finally moving to the bottom of the sneaker you've got this black rubber and gray rubber rounding off the outsole as you probably could have guessed from the entire review I love this shoe I think it's an incredible sneaker overall I think it's very versatile and I really think it's the best 990 sneaker ever personally I feel like it's a perfect mashup of comfort and style like it's the best of both worlds it's a greatl looking sneaker but it's also a very comfortable sneaker and as someone who loves crazy collaborations and honestly more limited sneakers I can't wait to see some of the crazy collaborations that take place on this shoe the paneling on the upper of this shoe is so interesting already when you throw on some different colors and some different details it's really going to make this sneaker pot genuinely this is one of my favorite sneakers of the entire year and I absolutely think it was worth the wait but hey I would love to know your thoughts on the 990 V6 and whether this is a sneaker that you're looking at grabbing so make sure to let me know your thoughts in the comment section down below thank you all so much for watching and I will see you all in the next one,2025-06-23 14:42:41.524550

nDo9p1qbZx8,Yeezy 350 v2,it's officially april so i'm going to dissect a pair of yeezy 350s because i want to know if these are actually a pretty decent pair of shoes or if it was all hype and i'm slowly learning you just can't trust sneakerhead hype in any way and you especially cannot trust these big sneaker brands to tell you the truth about what's inside of their sneakers there are two main things i want to see inside of this shoe and really test the first is the ultra boost foam midsole ultra boost if you don't know is basically the comfortable styrofoam for shoes where they take tons of these little teeny foam pellets and fuse them together and people say it's the most comfortable shoe foam in the entire world and adidas says created to bring together the formerly contradictory benefits of soft and responsive cushioning so we're gonna see if it's just gimmicky styrofoam for shoes or if there actually is some unique technology and a useful benefits to this phone the second thing i want to test is this primeknit upper that adidas says is designed to ensure perfect harmony within the product so let's see if that's just fancy jargon for an ultra thick sock attached to a shoe and we're going to put these materials to the test by burning them drowning them ripping them but first of all we're going to cut it in half did you know that testosterone levels have been dropping substantially over the generations our fathers generations they had testosterone levels that are 25 higher than ours today which is completely unfair but if you're like me and you're having a harder time concentrate as you get older you don't have quite as much energy and you catch yourself pouring yourself a few extra cups of coffee per day your testosterone levels might be to blame and the thing is it's not even necessarily our fault there's many factors such as environmental changes that are affecting our generation today 30 million men in the u.s alone have low testosterone that's affecting their daily lives the good news is home health is here to help and there's a ton of misconceptions about testosterone because it is more than just a sex hormone optimizing your testosterone can lead to increased energy increased muscle mass more focus and probably the most important thing for me is better overall mood and hone helps men get tested and treatment for low testosterone from the comfort of your own home and the entire process is super easy all you have to do is collect your sample mail it back to the lab once your results are ready you'll have a video chat with a real doctor who will recommend a personalized treatment plan based off of your biomarkers and symptoms and treatment options include fda approved medications and everything gets delivered straight to your door and i'm far from a medical expert but home health is and they'll be there with you every step of the way so ordered hones easy to use at home assessment test today to learn your testosterone levels and for a limited time viewers of the channel can get the at home test and the doctor consultation for only 45 dollars so click the link in my description or go to homehealth.com roseanville and thanks again to home health for sponsoring this video i chopped in half and that was really fun to cut but also really painful because they're so pricey but let's see what's inside there is so much more foam in here than i thought like i knew there was a good chunk of foam but i didn't know that there is just over half an inch of foam at the ball of your foot and just over an inch of boost foam at the at the hill which is a lot more than i expected and obviously it does compress quite a bit that's a lot of foam and i'm also really surprised at how thin this sidewall is that encapsulates that boost foam it's if we cut this open and put our little caliper in there it's less than a millimeter thick and it's a super soft rubber if we do a quick durometer test or how hard this rubber is on the outsole it's around 60. so it's not the softest rubber we've seen but it is definitely on the softer side then if we do the same durometer test on the midsole it's really soft we'll start with the closed celled portion that's exposed on the outsole that comes in at right around 20 to 25 and then if we test the cross section where we cut open those little teeny pellets that is ridiculously soft it's a five four and a half seven if we compare that to other foams that you see in other shoes especially boots like this blunt stone the hardness of that internal foam is 32 so way softer than any boot we've ever cut apart and especially a lot of the shoes we've cut apart and just out of curiosity and to see how flammable ultra boost foam is let's do a little flame test and see what happens to this phone when we try to light it on fire so it looks like it just starts to melt it doesn't actually start on fire or burn it anyway it is super sticky though and then if we go to the open cells put the flame on that so same type of effect it's just melting it doesn't really start on fire but the internal foam of those little pellets definitely burns a lot more than the outside shell and i think the shell around these individual pellets that's fused together is really what gives this boost foam its structure and its rebound because if this was just a solid piece of foam all the way through kind of like these blunt stones you're just compressing a lot of foam whereas with these you almost have a honeycomb effect on the inside like nike said was in the air max 2021 this is kind of what i expected to see inside of there i think those outer shells because they're a little bit harder i think they they compress just as much but they might have a little bit more rebound so that when you compress this it springs back a lot more it's kind of similar to how they put rebar inside a concrete to reinforce it and it also probably helps prevent splitting and cracking but i am curious how much this will absorb water especially once you've worn through some of this outer shell layer on the bottom and more importantly what happens if you do what some people say they do is they remove the insole and wear these without the insole what happens if your sweat starts to get in there this is going to be a big sponge of sweat so let's do a quick water test and find out so the closed cells on the bottom that are exposed before it's really worn don't really absorb that much water but these open cells absorb a fair amount of water it is definitely it stays wet once it's it's absorbed inside of there i think it would absorb more if those little air bubbles were bigger but because they're so tight and so small it doesn't allow a lot of a lot a lot of water to seep inside if i was wearing these without the insole in i would be concerned about how much of my sweat was going to be absorbed into the midsole causing these to really stink but what about this primeknit upper it literally just looks like a thick sock and my concern is that if you had a little teeny cut in it that it might just spread and completely ruin your shoes so let's do a couple tests to see how durable this prime knit upper is that actually came apart a lot easier than i expected especially to the cut those fibers just kind of dissolve away from that cut area in the spots where there's no backing that knit is still a millimeter and a half thick and i thought maybe it was double knit but as you can see as you pull this apart it just kind of comes unravels once you've cut through a few of those little fibers they're all dependent on each other for tension and to keep this whole thing together then what about the flame resistance of this primeknit upper does it just go up in flames if you stand next to an open flame let's find out so it seems like it's fairly self-extinguishing and because it is a basically a plastic based fabric it does curl up and and almost heal itself by melting into itself so it is it's still flammable but it's not once it starts on fire it's not gonna light your whole body on fire you're not on fire and while we're in the burning mood this little lace reinforcement that's two-piece people always refer to it as suede because it looks like suede leather but it's i don't think it is so let's do a little burn test and as i'm burning this i'm more not looking at what happens which i partially am but i'm more smelling to see if it smells like plastic burning or if it smells like burning hair or flesh if it's burning hair flesh it's leather if it's plastic smelling and it curls up like the upper did then it's plastic and that's plastic so not real suede and i don't think adidas has ever said it's suede leather i think it's just one of those things where people said it suede and people interpreted people saying it's suede as leather and then people just start repeating the same things over and over and over and all of a sudden everyone's calling it suede leather and it's not and then if you look closer into the toe of the vamp you can see that this toe stiffener that has a leather print on it that's embossed into it but i'm 99 sure it's not leather but let's put a little flame to it see what it does it's starting to curl up a little bit as for the smell smells like plastic so it's not leather and it's it's better that it's not leather because leather is a really good material for certain things but something like this where it needs to be really thin and it needs to be pulled and stretched and glued to a fabric a knit upper this is better than leather anyway and one thing that really through doing this this this video really stood out to me is like there's something about the shoe that looked really familiar other than the fact that everyone wore them for five years straight but this shoe reminds me of a primitive man's shoe like what they found on like the bog mid and like that iceman they found just laying in the snow it's like a primitive shoe made for the modern man and i kind of love it so overall this is a very simple shoe and it's a very comfortable shoe and this ultra boost foam really surprised me i did not think it was going to be quite as interesting as it was i thought i just thought it was cheap foam that had looked like styrofoam on the bottom but the internal structure is really interesting and i was also surprised at how not durable this this primeknit upper is it's still a really cool fabric and it flexes and stretches in really interesting ways and it looks cool but as for a just strictly a durability standpoint pretty terrible and for the price of these shoes are they worth it just looking at taking yeezy aside and kanye and every all the hype aside are these worth the money not even close they're they're pretty overpriced for being honest but they are wildly comfortable and you anytime you're looking at these shoes it's it's not just the materials that you're looking at you're you really have to look at the whole picture with the hype in it and the influences and who's associated with it because it does matter to people so let me know what you guys think and if you've had any issues with this midsole absorbing water or sweat the same thing with the upper and the next april video will be next saturday and thanks for watching see ya,2025-06-23 14:51:44.853693 UTC

just not have stuff or i don't know what to post although as it gets warmer i want to do regular vlogs i cut this out of every single vlog that i do but i say it every single vlog what would the thoughts be if i just did a vlog on like new york city and not about clothes would you all hate that and unsubscribe anyways today i'm wearing reebok club c85s a lovely shoe compared to the stan smith so they are an okay shoe because the stan smiths are the greatest white sneaker of all time and they are very sim as i said they're very symbolic and they helped me become who i am okay so quick intro to the story i consider there to be two very distinct parts of my life bs before stan smith and a.s after stan smith my life didn't change because i got the shoes my life was changing when i got the shoes for a very specific reason but i need to go because taylor and i we do have a dinner date today at 6 30 and it's 1 37 so i should really get this kraken during the bs stage of my life i was very happy go lucky but like too happy-go-lucky like kind of crazy happy-go-lucky hey what's up guys it is mike and okay super nerdy but at the same time like super oblivious to the world and like ignored it so this story involves people it's on the past it doesn't matter everything's good we're very young and it's all okay so during the stage of my life i dressed in yu-gi-oh graphic t-shirts graphic t-shirts in general but that's the period of my life the best way to say this is i didn't have an identity yet at all i just kind of followed things i didn't like think about who i was or how i presented myself or anything like that that's what i'm trying to say our generation is going to be one of the coolest generations ever and while i was this gelatinous blob still i got into my first relationship my first real relationship and when you're in the relationship and you're still a gelatinous blob you think this is probably gonna be the person that i marry to be fair the other person is also a gelatinous club so really your relationship is just based off of what you've seen on tv you're not really thinking about it too much so it's a bit odd the relationship's going great everything's going according to plan we're planning our wedding date everyone's super excited i'm starting to find out that i like theater and improv and we are having a ton of fun together and we're having so much fun together that the person dating decides it would be probably even more fun if they dated someone else on the side and didn't tell me so i was a little pathetic i didn't really know what to do i wanted to stay together i was like we could fix this with that now if that ever happens it's kind of good but at the time i had no idea so what was interesting is that that relationship was a pretty long relationship and it kind of kept me as a little blob in a box and i didn't change at all and i didn't like look up or anything i just stayed my little blobby wobbly self until that event happened and it took a little bit but it did happen i was walking with my camera and this guy said take a picture of my trunk and i was like i don't really want to do that he's like no take a picture and i looked in the trunk it's just a single baseball cap so the situation itself just kind of sucked in general i found out in probably the most public setting you could and met the person as i found out so that sucked but what was weird is that at the time i never really like looked at anything i was wearing and like a few months after that happened i looked like in the metaphorical mirror and was like oh i think i need new shoes like now so i went to savers a thrift shop and i found a pair of stan smiths they didn't look like this at the time they look like basically someone bought them and then scraped them somehow and then immediately donated them so i got them for seven dollars and that was the first time i ever made a really conscious decision of i want these shoes because they are white tennis sneakers and i think they'll go well with a lot of my outfits and that marked really the first time that i started just to think i don't i don't know what i started to think i guess more autonomously like for myself and at the time my fashion change from like the graphic tees and cargo shorts and shoes tied too tight to like perfectly fitted trendy stuff i feel like that's the cycle you go in you don't think about how you dress then you go exactly trends and then you start to branch out and do what you like and i lost that kind of like hunky dory everything's amazing g willikers at that time i feel like i just became like an actual person with thoughts okay so i got the stan smiths the new ones but i am running it very close to when i have to meet taylor are you a lace to the top type person or are you leave the top eyelid open wasn't a good thing to happen but i do think it was the catalyst to a lot of things happening so i don't know maybe it was a good thing to happen it was to really say at the end of the day it's been so long and all that i really could absolutely care less now and if someone said if you can go back in time and not have that happen i would say nope i this is i'm too happy right now to risk that changing anything because i think if that didn't happen i would have confused happiness or fulfillment with contentment and that's not something i want to do because after that incident i i didn't like boyfriend girlfriend date anyone for a while but i did date a lot of people in the meantime and met a lot of people and found out like which i believe everybody finds out after you date the first person you're like oh every this isn't my old relationship was way different than this one and my next one was way different than those two and you kind of slowly begin to shape what you want in a relationship and you see that the first person you've been with or the second or the third isn't how every relationship is and you learn a lot more so i think either way bs michael would not exist i think something would have come along and taken the globby blobby me that's whistling and singing down the street and shaped them more to have an identity it just so happened to be this and i think it's probably the thing that has shaped me the most because there's a few other things but i think this is probably the biggest thing where i was like okay that's how life works but also obviously i've made a ton of mistakes while dating i wasn't the best person that i could have been a lot of the times and i think that's just kind of how it goes you learn from both sides of the coin and then get happier and meet someone and keep meeting people and then you find someone that kind of checks all the boxes and you hope it works out happy anniversary,2025-06-19 08:39:25.625726 UTC
JVb7P88ItuE,Nike Air Max 90,let's get straight into it first and foremost I know what most of y'all are here for the sizing in the fit normally I go with a size n and just about every shoe but with this one I went a 9 and 1/2 so that's a half size up and it does have that little bit of extra toe space for the most part you can go true to size if you want to if you got a wide foot though you definitely want to go a half size up because this is a narrow shoe the toe boox is mesh right so you see that it gives you a little bit more room it feels like it's more room than if the whole toebox was leather that's good but the shoe overall is still narrow all the way through a lot of people always ask do they need to relace them how do you lace them like this I'm going to keep it a buck with you these I did not relace at all and I've just been wearing them just like and I really don't think you're going to need to relace these for the most part they're pretty comfortable from the get-go I know what you're thinking I know exactly what you're thinking will they make me as tall as Sha the answer to that is a 100% yes you will be 7 fo1 when you put these on is that it you want to be 71 put these on no I'm just kidding but uh you get about an inch of height out of these I mean you can see how big the air unit is on these it's it's quite a bit there if you put them on and sit down and you stand up you're going to feel the difference when you stand up outside of one or two pairs of shoes that I own air max90s are honestly the most comfortable still I a lot some people don't like them there's a lot of cushion on the uppers and around your heel so you don't you know you don't get that leather rubbing on the back of your heels or anything like that I think at their best when you plan on wearing them for a long periods of time like if you ever worn a pair of blazers Air Force Ones Jordan Ones anything like that you know those shoes hurt after like an hour or two if that these you can wear these for a long time for the most part and be good to go that's because one it does have the air unit and two the entire sole itself is actually a little bit more stiff than it is soft is like a good middle ground as to where like some shoes that are comfortable like the Club C 85s that are super soft all around and like they feel good to walk around in for a little bit but after a while because they're so soft you start to feel the ground beneath your feet with these they're so firm and they have a pretty thick sole you don't feel it as much like your foot settles into the shoe pretty nicely and because of that firmness you never really feel the ground like you're not you don't feel like you're just walking on the cement and to put it simply these shoes are really popular with nurses for a reason now hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on sit down take a minute and breathe before we get to the next part the pricing I know I no you sitting down you sitting down these are $130 retail 130 130 $130 $130 now what's crazy is that Air Force 1es are only $15 cheaper than these now that's a wild $15 cheaper than these these got like four different different materials on them and for ones are just all leather and it ain't even a good leather that's wild too because for the longest time these were like $100 too hell they were 94 a long time too times are changing let me tell you they kind of go on sale here and there it it's not very often but it's it's pretty often that they go on sale you just got to catch them at the right times it's usually during season changes that's when everything else goes on sale that's most of the time when you're going to catch this specific colorway on sale now you can't go on resale sites like Flight Club and stockx and goat and whatever else you choose but for the most part I've seen them range for about 105 to again $130 on those websites and if you can get them for $5 you might save like $5 because after taxes fees and shipping sometimes you'll end up paying more even though that initial price was less than retail if anything add it all to the cart see what the actual total is going to be and then do the same on the Nike website or at your local Foot Locker or wherever and see how much it's going to be that honestly might be the best place to go get a deal is inside a physical store like a Foot Locker or a Finish Line because if they got too much inventory they'll put them on sale in that specific store now before you go out and buy these there are a few things that you need to know one mesh is very hard to clean in general it is not fun to clean it's a bunch of fibers weave together right and so dirt gets stuck under there and if you scrub too hard on mesh it'll pull those fibers up and you get like a bunch of fuzziness that you can't really do anything about on the shoe keep that in mind same thing goes for the suede panels here CU this is all suede the swoosh is all suede but I think everything else is either mesh or leather me personally I plan on being the brakes off of these cuz they're so comfortable they're all black and I'll just wipe them down basically with like basic stuff the other side of that is that there is an all leather version in all black which means easier to clean you can go to Second resale site and get them but I haven't seen them on nike.com in a long time Finish Line I did see hat them and Foot Locker also had a pair of the all Leathers you can also again just go check in your nearest shoe retailer and see if they have them there and and last but not least this isn't really that popular of a shoe right now just this silhouette this shoe the Air Max 90 isn't really that popular so hopefully prices stay where they're at and they may go down and as always I will see y'all in the next,2025-06-23 11:26:28.479002 UTC
e4XBIhqljL4,Adidas Gazelle,let's talk about Adidas as we head into the summer I think it's safe to say that Adidas is the hottest brand in sneakers right now with a lot of models that are quick to sell out and if you're new to the brand you might be thinking what exactly is the difference between all these shoes well you clicked on the Right video because I'm going to be telling you everything you need to know about five of the most popular Adidas models right now including what size to get what makes each of these pairs unique and also what's the best sneaker for you and these five models are the Adidas Samba the gazelle indoor the handball speci the campus 2000s and the Adidas Superstar also all of the shoes mentioned in this video are available right now on adidas.com and I will leave some links in the description so you guys can buy for yourself first let's start off with a classic and that is the Adidas Samba this was originally a shoe designed for indoor sports but has now transcended into more of a lifestyle everyday shoe and these have gotten so popular now that people are starting to ask whether these are the new panda dunks yes these have been worn by everyone from your favorite celebr to your favorite Tik Tok influencers but there is a good reason for that and that is because these are very Timeless shoes that you can wear with pretty much anything it has this slim and minimalistic look to it which you can pull off with any outfit the sambas are also generally made out of leather that's what sets them apart from the other shoes on this list although there have been several special edition pairs like the whales boner collabs that came in a variety of different materials such as nylon or even pony hair the retail price on these is only $100 which is a great price for an everyday shoe important information about sizing though now the sambas are very narrow shoes especially in this midfoot area now I normally wear a US size 11 in some other Adidas models like the ultra boost or the nmd however in the samba I do go up half a size to an 11 and 1/2 when I wear these in my usual size the middle of the shoe is just way too tight on me so I definitely do recommend going up half a size on the SAS especially if you have wider feet moving on to the next sneaker on the list and that is is the Adidas gazelle indor now these are the fun and very loud pairs in this whole group of sneakers they do look similar to the sambar however they do have a Slimmer toe box and you'll notice that this t-shape here on the gazelle it's slightly exaggerated but what really sets these shoes apart are the variety of different colors that they come in the gazel aren't known for bold and bright colors they are really the shoes you want to wear as a statement piece gazel are usually made of suede as the base material although there are some leather vers as well I think some of the currently available colorways look really good the pair I'm showcasing right here is actually a collaboration with Gucci from a couple of years ago and it's definitely a bit more on the expensive side however gazel normally do retail for $120 and as far as the sizing goes these shoes do fit very different than the sambas I just talked about so with the gazel they actually fit bigger so for the perfect size I actually go down half a size for my true size so I actually wear a US 10 and a half in gazelle's which is completely the opposite to the samba which I go up half a size in I wear 11 and 1/2 in SAS and 10 and 1/2 in gazel the gazel do have a wider midfoot area so that's one of the reasons why you don't really need to go with your true size in these so I do suggest going down half a size the Adidas handball special is going to be the next shoe we discuss and these are currently the bestselling sneaker from Adidas especially among female consumers the smaller sizes of most colorway sell out very fast they were originally intended to be a shoe for the sport of handball these shoes do look very similar to the samba in terms of design but you'll notice that they do have a slightly higher ankle color and the shoe also features a bit more of a slanted look along the front whereas the sambas are much more flat and this sneaker in terms of looks is the perfect Middle Ground between the samba and the gazelle sambas are easily the most versatile of all the shoes mentioned so far and the gazel are possibly the least versatile the special however are right in the middle they also do come in loud colors compared to the sambas however the colors are much more muted compared to the gazelle and they also usually have these pretty dark colored midsoles which do tone down the sneaker even more they also typically only come in suede just like the gazelle and these are priced at $110 which just once again the Midway point between the pricing of the sambas at 100 and the gazelle's at 120 also from a comfort standpoint you might find the specials to be the most comfortable of the three shoes mentioned so far and that's because they do have pretty good art large support which you'll notice on the inner half of the shoe additionally you'll notice that the handball specials come with these round style laces whereas the sambas and the gazel have flat style laces for sizing these fit just like the gazel to me so they do fit big going half size down is what fits me the best however they do fit slightly more narrow than the gazelle so I would suggest that if you have wide feet then sticking with your true size in the spetial would be the best fit for you the next sneaker is also a very popular sneaker nowadays that is the Adidas campus 2000s now this shoe is a pretty recent design from Adidas compared to all of the other models I just talked about it's an updated version of the campus 8s which was originally a basketball shoe so the campus 2000s you can already tell there's definitely a bit of skateboarding inspiration here behind the shoe and you'll see that with these fat style laces that the shoes come with mine come with two different colors I got green and white and you also get this very padded tongue once again more of that skateboarding inspiration in the design it is also the chunkiest looking shoe out of all the pairs mentioned in this video if that's something you're going for and you'll also notice it does have a very different toe box here it doesn't have that t- shape like the other three pairs this one has much more of just a flat style toe box and the campus as well is typically made out of suede they are pretty wide foot friendly as well and they retail for $110 in terms of sizing these do actually fit me perfect at trud to size so I wear a US1 in these and if you're keeping score at home so I wear a 11 and 1/2 in sambas 10 and 1 12 in the gazel and specials and a size 11 in the campus 2000s and finally the last sneaker which we will be discussing is the Adidas Superstar which is maybe the most iconic Adidas shoe when you think about how important the shoe has been in early hip-hop history and they're also commonly known by another name and that is the Shell Toes and that is of course because of this very unique looking shell rubber toe boxes these are also I would say a little bit on the chunkier side but definitely not as chunky as the campus 2000 the superstars are also normally made with leather so you got the Superstar and the sambas on team leather and the gazel the specials and the campus 2000s on team suede these do fit me perfectly at truda size just like the campus 2000s these are pretty wide foot friendly so going with your true size will get you the best fit and I personally do really like wearing these with more baggier pants I think that's a nice look so there you have it five of the most popular Adidas models right now I hope I was able to help you guys decide which is the best one for you on if personal note if I were to rank my favorites I would say I got the gazelle indor at number one sambas at two and Superstars at number three but do let me know on the comments what is your favorite classic Adidas model

7v-FjR9oF8w,Yeezy 350 v2,listen guys i don't know if you're ready for this one because i definitely wasn't i also know that this month has been kind of a roller coaster with so many different releases you know you're winning some and you're losing some and it's up and down but i need you to go back out there and grab some of that excitement that you lost with those other releases and come back because we gotta take a look at these so of course we gotta break them open we gotta break them down today we're taking a look at the yeezy 350 mx rock so guys you will not believe this this is a brand new yeezy box i'm just kidding it's the regular 350 with the boost on the side let's pull them open and let's take a look at today's pair of sneakers guys trust me if you don't like these i don't know what you do like this is the yeezy 350 v2 mx rock and they just hit us with the belugas four days ago and now they come and release this they're really trying to make these decisions hard for us out here it's kind of a shame that these were delayed for as long as they were originally scheduled to drop back in september and now only released here in december they just kept getting pushed back for one reason or another but either way let me give you some of the release specifics on this pair of sneakers they dropped today actually on december the 22nd and they retail which is something you're going to want to remember guys for later on in the video they retail at the regular 180 pounds here in the uk or 220 out in the us hopefully if you tried to go out and get these today you managed to get a pair and also another thing i guess i should mention is the 350 blue tints they actually dropped today as well but that was an asia exclusive either way i feel like this is the more interesting colorway at least in my opinion okay so black 350s probably one of the most popular yeezy 350 colorway to ever bless this model but this is a really interesting one because it's not actually black this is the second mx version that yeezy brand has put on a pair of 350s of course we saw the first one the mx outdrop earlier this year mx essentially stands for mixture like we've seen on the foam runners and now the slides and i'm sure a bunch of other yeezy models in the future but on the 350 it does look really good now the way that they've worked this swirling pattern into the pair of shoes it looks really organic and something that isn't just manufactured you know there's no straight lines on here everything just looks kind of random now the colors that they've mixed into this is what makes this one stand out massively so for starters the base is black which is a great canvas to work on especially on a 350 and then swirled around into this upper is lighter and darker hues of brown and remember what i said about that price tag well let's talk about that for a minute because also worked into the upper of this sneaker is reflective material so basically what that means is the fact that these are the same yeezy 350 price point and still have reflective knit woven into the upper means that they didn't need to charge an extra 20 or 40 pounds for those belugas that's just for anybody who thought that they made it more expensive because the reflective knit is more expensive either way i am super happy they did add that reflective knit because it breaks up the colors on here and looks super cool like it's not often that you see on a pair of yeezys the reflective knit actually be used as a solid color like usually it's kind of hidden into the knit and you only really see it when you put that flash on well this you can see in broad daylight and then obviously when you hit it with that flash you can see it even more it lights up and it does look pretty cool we've also got the pull tab back something i'm super fond of it just kind of reminds me for one reason or another of the good old easy days the pull tab is all over black and it kind of bleeds into this semi-translucent stripe which is also black something i think works with this sneaker massively again the majority of the accents on this sneaker are all black except for the laces i mean they are pretty much black but you can definitely see they're a little bit lighter coming in a kind of charcoal color and again regular laces because i'm sure a lot of people made their point saying that they didn't like the infinities so i assume that's why they brought back the normal laces kind of different on different models some have it and some don't on the back of the sock liner like every other yeezy 350 you got the adidas 3 stripes it comes in brown but it's also reflective and finally the midsole which is all blacked out as well something that just ties all of the other colors together and oftentimes you know guys i honestly find some little thing about a yeezy 350 that maybe they could have changed the midsole color maybe they could have changed these small laces something like that but with this pair i think they nailed it i wouldn't change a thing another very small detail to note about these is the center stitching is now changed from the kind of cross stitching they do this from time to time with yeezys this is now the kind of reversed so it's kind of just blending in as one straight line on the upper now hopefully you guys sized up if you went for these today because they do fit small like any other easy 350 the general recommendation is to go a half size up again it's the same story by now if you're someone who has bought a lot of 350s you're probably used to it half size up is a must when it comes to 350s honestly guys if the belugas didn't drop i feel like this would be my favorite easy 350 this entire year they just look so good on foot and honestly this colorway is so easy to rock with a bunch of different outfits like you could either work your outfit into these browns or just keep it blacked out and match whatever you would normally match with a triple black pair of sneakers very very versatile pair of sneakers and you guys already know the comfort having full length boost is a extremely comfortable pair of shoes so definitely a really solid option and you're probably going to be happy with these if you did manage to grab them but either way guys that is pretty much everything you need to know about the yeezy 350 v2 mx rock let me know if you managed to grab these today and let me know what you think about this sneaker in general let me know down in the comment section thank you so much for coming through hanging out for yet again another one thank you for liking commenting and of course subscribing i'll catch you in the next one but until then you,2025-06-23 14:51:50.144823 UTC
nf1PwJ9H8I4,Stan Smith,man I love the feeling of this stance missed looks from Adidas [Applause] I think the quality on this Adidas Stan Smith look they are amazing for the price point that you pay for is only 145 I think the regular Stan Smith with PU leather upper I think it's around like 90 bucks I remember when I was in college and I know a friend that worked for Adidas and you know Adidas employee they often got 50 off for their products so we went to the store with him and we got 50 off on a pair of Stan Smith that was like dirt cheap I bet the whole sale on a pair of Stan Smith fresh out from Factory it's around like 20 to 25 dollars that they make them in the factory you know I think this version of Adidas stands Miss look should be a regular quality standard for all Adidas trainer the fitting on these shoes though is fit two two side uh usually when I wear a regular Stan Smith shoes with the Pu material upper they kind of hurt my forefoot a little bit but this one because the material is very soft and also very flexible so I don't really feel that discomfort around my far first area Comforts why is very comfortable I think the insole foam that they use is a little bit thicker than the regular stands met they come with three different colorways on the shoes this is the white colorway with the dark green mustache color pop and um the other one I think also white colorway with the black black and white sneaker is a little bit normal in my opinion and the other one was really nice too is the pair of triple black stand Smith besides using the premium leather on the shoes the construction wise also it's a little bit different around the Ice Age area on the regular stand Smith you can see they leave it as raw Edge but this one they fall all and Stitch so leave the edge is more cleaner and it look more premium and also this technique though they actually use more materials and at the tongue you can see there's Adidas three foil stands matte indoor buys and wet stands missed face I actually have an honor to met him in person before doing my Footwear design competitions that was a real experience because I didn't really check up his image before on the internet the only thing that I know about his face was really on this stance with a tongue the graphic on this tongue though is look almost a hundred percent identical to his real face in persons and also backs to the heel counter you can see there's a dark green colourpop mustache with the deboss of the tree foil and below that you can see there's a deboss up the Stan Smith's name and go to the tooling of the shoes is the using cup sole with the reinforcement stitches to reduce the bonding Gap and go to the lining of the shoes so this lining though is pretty good executed the Hue counter they use a real leather for a premium look and also the rest of the lining material from the heel counter to the toe area they used letters so they don't really cutting the budgets there unlike the regular stance mid they basically have the PU leather around the heel counter only if you look deeper into the lining material around the tall area they actually have the canvas molded create the top box so give it more D5 shape and also the insole they use a leather material on the surface of this insole foam now you hear all the good thing about this Adidas Stan Smith Lux right let's talk about one thing that I'm a little bit picky on the design of the shoes which is this Larry outside you can see the Stan Smith branding I would prefer this foil stencil branding go a little bit closer to the Hue counter which is in this area right here are similar to The Branding that they place on a pair of Samba that would look nicer in my personal reference because the foil stands with branding is a little bit distract me from that enjoying the quality leather of this pair of Stan Smith looks material of the shoes they are premium you know it's just less the quality of the leather speak for itself definitely it's the bad shoes from Adidas that release to close up this 2022 most of that small Footwear brand they basically have a copycat of the version Adidas stands matte and with the price boy around 200 to 250 dollars for just a knock up Stan Smith sneaker I'm not heading on the small brand do your thing but if your brand is just based on the premium leather and good craftsmanship and make in Italy then they can really compare it to this pair of Adidas stance Mist Lux because this pair of stance metal they have very rich history you know and styling with issues I believe everybody can look good with a pair of Stan Smith sneaker and dishes look good with everything jeans dress pants definitely is look better in dress pan in my opinion because you know this pair is unlike the regular Stan Smith sneaker this is Stan Smith's Lux for a reason so I think would look better on a pair of dress pants and up next I'm gonna share with you guys how I would like to style them foreign foreign thank you so there you go this is my quick review on this pair of Stan Smith looks from Adidas what a great shoes and I really like the quality on these shoes the middle a lot of time that I wouldn't recommend people to spend too much money on shoes and buy so many shoes but this is the great shoes for you if you're actually looking for a pair of white shoes to wear for this upcoming holiday season Christmas and New Year and also it's not just a great shoes for you it's also it's a good shoes as a present for your loved ones because you know who doesn't like the crunchy

too sorry usually what's up everybody why Davis here back with another review today I'll be showing you guys the Nike Dunk low black white panda now before I get into the video I just want to say thank you guys for support keep on liking keep on subscribing and it really motivates me to keep going when I see you guys like on my content also let me know I'm in the right direction and showing you guys you want to see if you're new to the channel I just want to say thank you and welcome I drop a lot of good content here so consider subscribing also there's a 4K video playing in the background of me and you got some news videos coming ahead of time and follow me on Instagram at y Davis but let's get right into it guys hey guys now the word of today is document um I should have been recorded this and Ben did a video on this shoe about a year ago dang I know sometimes it's hard to pull out the tripod or you know record yourself in front of people but you know you have to get over that nervousness and just do it you know what I mean um once you realize that you can do it and you don't have to care what people think and people say it's really going to change your life forever especially especially because you know in today's world everybody has something to say behind a phone and just say anything about what you have to do in life but if they're not paying your bills or you know taking care of you in any type of way it shouldn't matter to you and shouldn't matter to them you know what I mean uh once I realized that it really has changed my life and to give you a perfect example of this you know sometime in life you know when we see a woman out there we might be too shy to say something and things like that but you won't know unless you try and sometime when you try yes it is a no but now you know it's a no instead of it could have been a yes so I mean you could go off of that and take that for what you want but um that's just how I think and I'm gonna just leave it off on that note and that's why I want to say that the importance of documenting everything is a must-have in today's world um just like sometime when I'm talking about these old events or old times that I had when I was younger I wish I had you know certain videos or pictures to show you guys but I only can show you so much because that's all I was taking and you know as a kid I was taught to like you know write in a journal and things like that and it it was cool for like a day or a week or two and I'm like man what am I doing this for but now I'm wishing I actually did have that journal and for the ladies out there I know if you still have a diary please don't stop writing it because you know later on you just want to see how your thoughts was and where you were in life and sometimes it can make you have brainstorms about your old events and um just document everything God I'm telling you guys um you know I probably should have posted this video maybe a year or two ago who knows how many views it would have had by now but you know it is what it is I'm doing it today and uh yeah let's get right into it so today was a movie as well and today is Labor day but to me back in the day labor day used to mean that school is starting back up or if it hasn't started already and uh Foot Locker and Nike just let it go today um you know yesterday they did the thing at Willowbrook Mall and when people see things like that it's like okay well if they did it yesterday then GSP is going to do today GSP means Garden State Plaza or ADM is going to do it ADM is American Dream Mall which is probably the third or second biggest mall in the US but um anyway American Dream actually did drop dunks they didn't drop as many as Willow did I think Willows the number two uh Foot Locker in New Jersey but uh BTC which is Bergen Town Center um Nike and uh they just let it go today they had shimmers they had probably over 150 pairs I didn't go because I didn't want to wait in a long line but it probably would have been good content for you guys to see and they had them on discount now they was B grade if you guys don't know what B grade is B grade is just like something is probably wrong with like maybe the leather or has too much glue on it or something like that but they stamped the box and they stamped the inside of the shoe to let you know that just be great so if you guys try to sell it people know what they're getting because not everybody knows what's the difference between the B grade and a regular standard pair but uh they just let it go today and wow it was just amazing and you know they probably are doing these things because school is starting back up to give people these opportunities to get these shoes but you know we don't really know why you know they drop things on certain days but I just want to let you guys know that as well so um here we go the Nike Dunk low black white AKA Panda we got all red box with the white Nike and the swoosh under it all right front of the box I think over the size 9.5 some people already know the skew by heart but we don't get to suggested retail on these retail on this was 110. retail at first was 100 bucks and then it went up to 110 and now there's rumors that it might be going up another 10 bucks so we will see when that happens but uh open up the top of the box here all right then we see the stamping and everything like that on the inside of the Box you get the regular tissue paper right here and let me take out this most iconic shoe that Nike has ever made possibly um if you guys look on the skew on side of here you know this shoe was produced in uh 3 9 22 to 4 28 22 so they are making these shoes like hot cakes you know what I mean who knows what batch this is of how many shoes but let's get right into it guys on the bottom of the shoe here we get that black with the Nike right there also we get the swoosh under that in black as well going towards the top of the shoe here we get those not so detailed stars coming towards the outsole to shoot here it's in a white outsole with the white stitching same thing on the inside of the shoe right there all right coming back towards the outside of the shoe here we get the black and white as you guys can see on the main panel right here white leather on the outside of the shoe right there on top of that we get that black swoosh and if you guys look right before it goes back to the black panel on the white panel we get that white stitching right there normally that is the color of the actual deeper tone on the shoe so if the back of the shoe is a white leather whatever color that other tone is that's the color that the stitching would be but on the Nike Dunk low Panda white black it is a white stitching instead of a black stitching or the color that's on top um so you know look for that to make sure your pairs are real I Reign on those other panels we just get the black on the outsides of the panels all right coming towards the inside of the shoe here we get the same thing as you guys can see same color scheme going on we still get that white threading right there right before switches panels on the Swoosh all right coming towards the front of the toe box here we get this white leather on the front of this toe box and these will crease up pretty nasty pretty easily maybe the even the first time you put these on the ground so you know if you want to keep these looking nice and as fresh as possible get some wearable shoe trees in these it will help them out a lot the mud guard here we get the black on the guard and also if you guys look right there before we actually go into the white of the toe box we see that Peak we see those black Peaks right there right there you can barely probably see it but we got some black peeps on here unfortunately only get one pair of laces in these and the panels on this shoe is in the black panels all right but if you guys look at the tongue here we get those white mesh tongue and at the top of the white mesh tongue it says Nike with the swoosh under it and white and the background of that is black now on the inside of the tongue hair just tells us about where the shoe is from and things like that and once again on the production of the shoe here it is 0309 22 to 4 28 22 all right so they are making these pretty quickly and getting them out to the public ASAP I don't know how long this was sitting in the actual Foot Locker could have been sitting there for months it could have been sitting there for weeks I don't know but didn't know they released it all today or yesterday um on your sock lining of the shoe here it is black as you guys can see or you know on the actual insole we get the white insole with the Nike and the swoosh under it and black with the sizing sticker on top of that now we do get the old insoles it's not like the new insoles that I've been showing you guys but this is what the insole that we used to get on some of the Jordans the stiff you know insole right here that has the glow on the bottom that's kind of hard to take out and put back in and the price increase of these shoes which you know they probably will still give us this and so because you know it's a money thing and this is probably one of the cheapest slash hottest items to make and they just want to keep you know banging out these items because they don't know how long the hike will last but I'll show you guys what it looks like under the insole right there all right show you guys the back of the shoes as well at the top of the back of the shoes we get that black leather and then we get the Nike and the white stitching under that we get some more white leather with some white stitching then it goes down to the black with the black leather okay now I'm gonna show you guys my foot is in the toe box right now okay guys so this is what they look like on feet pretty clean in my opinion and I'm a true size nine and only get nine and a half in on my shoes except for 450s and 350s I believe you need to go full size up on those and normally when it comes to Air Jordan 1 lows Nike Dunk Lowe's uh Air Force One lows I normally like to go true to size because they do tend to run a little bit bigger now I was only able to get a 9.5 in these and uh I will say that they do run a little bit big now you can go through the size or even half a size down if you want like a snug fit but if you have a wider foot I would consider you guys going true to size or if you want to be sure and you're buying these off the aftermarket um you can go up half a size if you think you need a half a size up but um as you guys can see here I'm gonna show you guys my big toe is in the Box big toes right here okay so I do have a good amount of space in here as you guys can see um these will crease up pretty easily so make sure you guys put some wearable shoe trees in these if you want them looking brand new at all times now if you wear your shoes laced up if you get a half size up you won't have to worry about the slippage and anything you'll just have that problem of space in the front but if you like the way your shoes on laced like myself I'm sure you guys what it looks like right here so we do have a little bit of slippage in the back right here but normally when I have a little bit of slippage in the back of my shoes this is what I do see this row right here when we get the lace uh hole right there in the middle I just pull this one tighter pull this one tighter like that and then it just fixes the shoe as you guys can see so now my foot doesn't come out of this shoe at all um you know you might have to keep adjusting that throughout the day but that's normally how I fix the uh slippers part I just make this Loop tighter to make the tongue stay in more so that's pretty much it but anyway um now on the front of the toe box here it is a little bit narrow and then once it goes towards the back of the shoe it does open up so that's why I explained that part about if you need a little bit more space in your shoes or have a wider foot you might have to go half size up but you know true to size is the way to go in my opinion unless you have a wider foot or need a little bit more space um I do like the way this size 9.5 fits but I would rather have the size nine it's just a closer fit and uh it's a little bit less slippage on the back of the shoe but other than that I'm gonna show you guys the section different pants options right now okay guys hope you guys like this video make sure you guys like comment subscribe show your boy some love and stay tuned foreign foreign thank you foreign foreign foreign foreign,2025-06-23 14:49:35.342655 UTC
TT0Cw46Z1jI,PUMA Suede,man oh man now this isn't the first time Teenage meetting Ninja Turtles done a collab actually feli did it first then Adidas did it better now Puma has entered the chat walking in the city soy big kick always looking pretty face is tight and clean more fresh in your seen Big Al got the dream off stepping on the scene big kicks rocking through the streets yeah got big tricks styling can't be no every unique comfort you can seek big kicks y'all strong and never weak what's good everybody it's your boy Big Al kicks and welcome to my Channel today we got something epic man like I said in the intro Puma has entered the chat and they are not playing games with this one they pulled out the stops everybody knows the story between pman and Adidas the founders were brothers and they always in constant competition with each other and you remember how last year how amazing the Adidas collaboration with TMNT was but I think Puma may have taken it the edge further but we'll let you guys decide this isn't the first time we seen you know good collaboration packaging on movies and TV shows and things like that growing up but we'll get into all of that and more but before we get into this video if you have not subscribed to the channel yet please go ahead hit the Subscribe button don't forget to click the Bell to turn the post notifications on so you don't miss a beat and I'm not even going to lie guys I am so mesmerized by the packaging of these shoes and Puma did it as if it was a pizza box you see it right here on the front it says Pizza Time Crazy details artwork man from the old generation to the new generation I grew up watching teenage Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and then they came back a couple of times for the newer generation so it's a dope multi generational thing man to see these return but enough laughing about it let's go ahead and read the label man I'm still stoked about this packaging by the way guys and the label says sued XL TMNT those if you don't know TMNT is Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and these retail for $110 but if you order from Snipes or some of these other places you can get a coupon code and get these for right around 100 so I will link these in the description so you can check them out for yourself and and I got them in my size a size 10 now I've seen pictures of the pulo suede xl's or whatever and they kind of remind me of a skateboard shoe so come a little closer we going to take a quick look at them okay guys we got these bad boys in hand and this is what I was talking about a nice good up close of the logo and on the side Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles right here it's like three pizza boxes but it says right here again Guys Pizza time and it has the Puma logo right there and then their famous phrase cow Bunga I think my favorite Turtle of all time has to be Raphael and I'm a little biased towards Raphael I always love the sarcasm but yeah man oo now this is how you do a collaboration I don't know if this is a sticker I think it's stickers yes this is like a big huge sticker and it has all the turtles you guys get a good look at that man this is nice wow and then on the back it has Puma teenage mut Ninja Turtles it's a pizza it is pizza time and you get all these lace options you know you got Michelangelo Raphael Donatello Leonardo and then you have a pin for each one of the guys I don't know if my light is blinding it but yeah it's pretty cool I'm I'm going to give some more closeups of that as a matter of fact I want to bring the camera a little closer cuz these are very detailed all right guys we have the paper and of course it says Ninja Turtles teen these Ninja Turtles with the Puma sign on it and again here are the pins and the laces for each turtle and the pizza thing again but let's see the shoes oh and boom guys the these are fire Adidas has definitely been put on notice with these bad boys they give me a kind of a skateboard shoe feel to it and I like that it looks almost like a SB a little bit like if Puma had a SB but the Puma suede is you know it's a icon on its own so that's the right shoe and this is fire guys wait till you see this other shoe and this is the other shoe with the sewer hang tag that is crazy yes city sewer that is crazy right there and it's a puma suede XL you see the texture but the different color Puma logos is what got my attention man the a gum bottom oh and they put the cow bungle on the bottom now Adas did a gun bottom too but I think Puma took it a step further with the say so I don't know man Puma you might have did it a little better now there are other pairs in the collaboration itself try to see if there's any other details in this box all right we're going to I think there's no other details in the box but we're going to go ahead and look at the shoes all right guys so again like I said we got them and definitely gives a skateboarding style shoe feel to it teenage beja turtle logo and Puma logo on the tong nice materials and they did both come stuffed with tissue paper so we're going to start with the ins Souls first it's the first thing we're going to do and while we doing that um drop a little turtle history now the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle comic books came out in 1984 and everybody wore the same color bandana and belt they just had initials to separate it to make it different but this made it easier by giving them colors and it made it easier to identify in ' 87 the cartoon had um been debuted on TV and it ran for a little while and then the legend was born but look at the insole this insole is crazy 2025 vacom has the guys on there little sticker right there and this one has viom and just plain with the Puma collab and has a sticker showing the materials the uppers is leather textile lining and Rubber Sole which is good stuff city sewer hang tag for the nice touch if you know Turtles used to live in a sewer and when you take the insole out the left shoe you can see a little bit of the pizza but again I hate to throw the Adidas one in here the pizza toppins on the inside and you lift that up and you got the city sewer on the bottom which I thought was crazy but again we'll let y'all decide at the end of the video so the uppers is leather has the green texture of the turtles These are nice materials they put into this very soft padded ankle collar pizza cheese with toppings on the inside of that left shoe like we was talking and again left shoe is Donatello so we're going to go through each one so it's donatell my favorite Raphael and then on the other one you got my boy Leo and Michelangelo think all these guys who named that the Italian artist which is crazy flat green laces but the accessories got the real real fat laces I don't know if I'm going to switch I kind of like the the nude look like that but I'm definitely going to rock my teenage ninja turtle socks my daughter's got me for Father's Day crazy detail cow Bunga which is one of their sayings on the out sole I'm ecstatic man I I'm I'm ecstatic very very very nice touches they did it simple and plain they knocked this packaging out the park but we're going to look at the accessories that came with it man we're going to dig into those a little bit more all right guys so let's go ahead and take these out man and look at these a little bit closer yeah get in the comments guys let me know if you would put pins on it and which laces you would put on it to make it funky to personalize it to your taste and make it how you want to I don't know man I might leave it like it is I might take a couple of pins of my favorite ones and put it at the bottom you know just to show a little personality but again who did it better are we going to say Adidas did it better or we're going to go with the Puma guys if Puma do it better better than Adidas they're always in competition with each other but to keep it fair Adidas went more with the origins of the turtles they kept it creative with the bandanas and just keeping it red because that's who they are and were originally so Adidas underlined it with originality and Puma went and connected more broader with the audience with the newer audience with the newer things the colors and all of that sorts things or whatever but it's hard for me to determine which is better but enough talking about it y'all know what we do around these time kicks get rocked every day around here B come on I'mma personalize these a little bit maybe I'm going drop a couple of pens on them I'mma put these on feet we going to take him to the streets all right guys before we get these on feet we're going to personalize these bad boys right here definitely have a lot of options I'm going put my two favorite Turtles up there well I was going to do the laces but I might do the laces and a on foot or something like that and another reel so you guys can see it yeah but guys check it out all right guys we got these bad boys on feet now I did do a little personalization to them and and I put my favorite charms of my favorite ones I got ralie right here on your right and I got Mikey right here on y'all's left and I got some teenag turtle socks to go with it now as far as the fit I went through the size and these are good so far I like the nice padded tongue is nice and comfortable the logos are good and visible the logos are good and visible and yeah man you got Mikey right here you got Mikey right here on the side and got my boy Ralph on the inside yeah but these are dope man the sewer thing right here sewer top where they lived at so I asked the question in the video who did it better I'm rolling with Puma not because it's new but I like the use of materials and Puma just did a wider collaboration you know they gave us more clothing apparel and things like that now Adidas gave us the comic book and the toy packaging but they didn't give us nothing to wear with it but these right here ladies and gentlemen they take the cake Puma and Adidas are always at odds with each other and now I love the competition so guys get in the comments let me know which one you are feeling the most I told you mine yes this is one of my favorite releases of this year the Box all the details you know I forgot which one has cow bungle on the foot is it this one okay this one has the cow Bunger under the foot or whatever very dope collaboration and guys that is it that's my thoughts and opinions get in the comments let me know if you feeling these and if you enjoyed this video give this

kmHMVy_2_vM,Reebok Club C 85 Vintage shoes,my dreams come true starting off with the construction of the shoe the ebo clopsies are a quote inspired sneaker with a classic tennis shoe silhouette embracing its 80s Heritage rebok clsy retains its retro design language with a panel leather upper and a slim midsole the upper is made of the splash genuine leather with seams of stitching across the shoes multiple panels across the T box are three rows of perforations for increased ventilation the model I have here in hand is the REO Club c85 vintage editions and this work version comes with a high quality leather upper and a unique chalk colorway the club C also includes a detached tongue made of soft foam and a terry cloth lining around the ankle collar the sock liner made of thick foam is glued to the foot bed they can be detached with minimal effort if one needs to lastly the outsole is made of high abration resistant rubber with glide Groves throughout the length of the shoe coming to the upper the ebok club c85 in this vintage Edition is made of this soft and pliable leather which is hands down one of the plushest leather uppers have come across in a sneaker in this price bracket the leather feels high quality and luxurious which for a change is so refreshing to see in a shoe at a non-luxury price What drew me initially to the rebok club seies was a classic retro shoe wipe that it gave off with its off-white chalk colorway and the layer construction of the upper it's not ostentatious in its appearance and it has just about enough going on to help it stand apart from other white shoes with a rather simpler appearance I love the chalk colorway on these vintage versions which gives the shoe an appearance of refinement that you often find in luxury products this particular color also helps keeps things understated and they don't create the same sort of contrast a pure white shoe does when match with a pair of dark jeans or trousers I've own the Rebo Club Seas for over a year now and even today I enjoy the feeling of the soft and supple leather over my feet every time I put on the shoe debok does not specify the type of leather used on the shoe and the website refers to it as a soft garment leather in my opinion it most likely is some form of chrome tan G leather but I may be wrong for the Rebo Club c85 I went through to size and they fit perfectly across the length and breadth of my foot even with its round and taper toebox shape the shoe feels quite roomy for my moderately wide feet and I felt no pressure points whatsoever the soft impliable leather upper feels FL and comfortable giving my feet a sensation of being wrapped inside an old and cozy leather jacket I love the feeling of wling my toes and watching the leather upper mold accordingly it's a feeling that unfortunately is rarely found in leather fall of the shoes at this price range the club seies also have a traditional detached tongue made of soft foam the tongue feels light and unobstrusive but it does tend to move out of place when you are walking with a regular evm M Soul the expectation isn't one of high levels of cushioning to my surprise the midsole performs remarkably well in providing adequate levels of comfort even after hours of use the midsole isn't soft and Squishy like the max squishing forms but it's not uncomfortable either the EV foam isn't firm and stiff and it has enough softness to give you above average comfort even after hours of wear the shoe bear is quite flat and the lack of art support can be an isue for flat foots this issue can be partially solved by using custom insults and i' suggest you try these with custom insults if you require our support a year later it's fair to say that the shoe has held up well which also includes 6 months of extensive use as daily work shoes the construction and quality of the upper has surpassed my expectations and I'm yet to see glaring signs of cracks or creases that one often finds in lowquality leather uppers as you can see the upper is quite pliable and does not suffer from any major signs of cracks or creases around points of stress the creases that have developed are minor enough to not appear glaring and add character to the Fine age appearance it has developed over time the club Seas also pass a tolex test with flying colors as highlighted earlier I daily the club sees as my work Paar shoes and this use case often involves extended durations of toe bends while am on my seat while this can be the downfall of many leather shoes the club Seas remain unfl fluttered with this kind of stress test with the club sees on my feet I no longer care about the way my feet are planted on the floor that's not to say that the shoes are in Min condition like they were when they first arrived over time there are signs of wear and air which you will see in a bit on the lateral side there are some permanent stains which I believe are down to some unwanted rubbing against an abrasive surface on the InStep of my left shoe there is also a minor discoloration near the last eyelid there are marks that may have been caused by my shoe accidentally brushing off against the wall or a concrete the construction of the shoe is quite solid and it is quite evident in the way the sole looks after one year of extensive use the outsole 2 is in great condition with minimal wear on the outsole tread on number of occasions I have accidentally bumped the front of the shoe either against sidewalk or a race platform despite these stress test there are no visible signs of damage or dents on the exterior of the Mido overall the club Club se's are a durable shoe and I can't recommend them enough the club se's fortunately don't have many cons to start with nevertheless there are certain limitations to the rebok clsy which are down to the category of the shoes they belong to as expected they cannot replicate the comfort of Max cushion shoes and there are certainly better alternatives for people who are on their feed the whole day in spite of these limitations the club sees do punch about their weight and I have used these extensively at events and long AO days without any sort of discomfort in fact the Eva midso provides above average cushioning for this class and I experien no sort of heel pain or ankle discomfort Club se's do have one short coming which is noteworthy in my opinion with the multi-panel construction the leather panels overlap one another leaving exposed edges at the point of seeing with extended use these exposed edges tend to darken and create a sort of distraction that make the shoe appear dirtier than it is unlike the leather upper the raw EXP post edges are harder to clean and as a result the shoe will never look as fresh as they did out of the box unfortunately this also means that the club Seas cannot be used for occasions that need a reste outfit and a spotless pair of shoes in conclusion the EB Club se's rank amongst my best purchases so far and they have been a staple of my wardrobe since day one they look great especially in the chalk colorway and the multipanel Stitch uper gives the shoe a distinct character and depth that you won't find in other shoes I don't see them being replaced anytime soon and they would always remain my go-to pair of shoes for more circumstances so if you're in the market for a casual white sneaker look no further than the rebor club c85 vintage editions you won't be disappointed you're watching fast forward and I'll be back with my next long-term review,2025-06-19 08:38:07.456426 UTC

DdIZf0IpcU4,New Balance 2002R,"new Balance is re-releasing a shoe that in my opinion is the best shoe they've put out to date so I'm excited about this one the 2002R Protection Pack consists of three shoes this time the Raincloud the Sea Salt and this black one i don't know the name of the black one happy Junth right cool sea Salt is so great i think it's the peak of anything they've ever put out new Balance I love you but prove me wrong you know what I'm saying this is so good set to drop July 1st uh globally it already dropped June 4th in Europe specifically for €180 which translates to I think around $200 i'm not going to lie to you 200 i do it easy pc i tried to buy these a couple years ago on go $400 is ridiculous to me i bought these to cope you know what I'm saying this was a couple months later this is such a good shoe i still like these but it's not the sea salt this is the lunar year protection pack whatever 2002 are cool right this silhouette is just so good the way it looks beat up but it's not beat up and that's why I couldn't do these ones you know what I'm saying they look dirty but they're also a little My mom would have been like ""Why are you spending $200 on something?""

Dhd3LQjEMfM,Adidas Superstar,new foam Runners while this is a new foam shoe from Adidas but it is a little different than you'd expect when I heard Adidas was taking the iconic Superstar model but removing the laces to make it a foam shoe I knew I needed to check it out to see what it was like well right away you notice that they're not exactly like the foam Runners but a material that feels almost like the adolette slides now they only have a couple of small holes for breathabilities so they're not fully exposed either but I had to see if they were comfortable like the foam Runners now I appreciate Adidas for trying something different and I'll say they're not uncomfortable but I don't think this is a shoot for me,2025-06-23 14:43:37.414277 UTC
PMXmoH2eWTI,Air Jordan 1,new shoes who dis I've been eyeing these shoes for a long time and I've finally got my hands on here's my quick review of the Jordan 1 golf shoes in wolf gray this is the same colorway as the Dior Jordan Ones but obviously not the same price so the golf version of the Jordan Ones don't have spikes but they have more tread for golfing I have other pairs of Jordan Ones and I'm gonna be the first to say that they're not the most comfortable shoe but these golf versions are so comfortable they also don't look too bad on the course,2025-06-19 08:40:08.570784 UTC
tUTBr2LYcMA,New balance 550,nike air force one versus new balance 550 both in the white color both for summer both are actually retro basketball shoes but people wear both casually all the time now the overall design is pretty similar both are heavier than you'd expect both have terrible quality boxes but the 550s are exceptionally bad the air force one is entirely white but the 550 has gray on the bottom both aren't the most comfortable right out of the box but i think the 550 gets more comfortable with wear i always love air force ones but something about the 550 being a little different gives the 550 my vote,2025-06-23 14:50:49.810577 UTC
bQenAQV1Ksg,New balance 550,now I've tried these out in a number of different color ways and none of which I've been truly impressed by until this one this definitely is their best version yet hey what's going on guys my name is Chris welcome back to the official wear testers.com YouTube channel before we get started if you can do me one quick favor hit the like button or dislike button both of which are considered engagement leave a comment you don't have to do it right now but sometime during this video that would be great and if you haven't subscribe buttons down below it's free and turn on notifications if you haven't already all of those things really help us out not just with the algorithm but also we're trying to hit that million Mark we're very close and if we can get to it quicker or sooner than the estimation that they're giving me that would be awesome but I can only do that with your guys' help so please do those things I would greatly appreciate it but with that being said uh yeah these are awesome so most of you guys should know by now this is the New Balance 550 it's a 80 style basketball shoe that has been brought back to kind of combat the dunk era I don't even consider it the dunk era I just feel like you know the 80s basketball stuff is popular so every brand kind of has their thing now the shoe itself has released in multiple colors multiple variations high tops low tops collabs Galore most of which have been in my opinion at least by new balance's own standards like the standards that they set for themselves they've all been pretty lackluster you know what I mean like the materials have just been I just don't really love the way that they fit and they feel they take a really long time to break in they're super narrow however I ran across this pair and I was I was like this might be the best one yet I didn't even know that the materials were as good as they are I just saw the mesh panels and I was like those might be awesome it's not until I got them in hand where I was like oh my gosh why couldn't every pair be made like this these are so nice so yeah the out soole right here is the same as every other 550 it's thick it's rugged it's durable it's definitely a massive departure from out souls for basketball shoes today everything is very much like a reduced weight this is the complete polar opposite of that this this is a lot yeah you can just see how Slender that is my foot is definitely not like that you know what I mean and most people's aren't you do wear the 550 though and you have a wide foot do you like them if my feet could somehow like suck it in and inhale as I was like putting them on that's how they feel for at least 30 minutes when I'm walking around I agree and I don't even have white feet and like like the red ones are Super Fresh but like I'm just like what the like why do I wear these you know what I mean so probably should have saved that for the fit section but whatever I just needed to know now the midsole itself while you're looking at it from the lateral side or the exterior view it doesn't look like anything crazy it looks like a rubber cupsole which it pretty much is however the medial side is broken up this is pretty standard for 80s basketball shoes most of the time it would be both sides that were like kind of opened up just so that you could see the polyurethane wedge that was inside the wedge itself feels okay it's nothing crazy obviously it's house within all of this rubber so is it going to have a chance to really move and expand no not really that was a performance feature at the time so I get it that was dope as far as Modern Performance goes probably proba not the best thing not the worst thing but not the best thing and then on top of that wedge is actually a board glass and it's a it's a stiff one too that's what she said but on top of that is this insole which is only half a piece what the light part the light blue part that's the you know what I mean like that's the part that's going to give you the most step and comfort but this is also the part that's going to bottom out the quickest that could be a good or a bad thing depends on your perspective bottoming out also could be interpreted as molting to your foot shape my Gro move this back half though I really like it's more of a lightweight kind of Eva it's like a foot cradle it's got some molding to it and everything so I don't think that this is a complete piece of junk insole but I find that this is better than most now like I was saying earlier the materials on these or the material switch up I don't know how many pairs are built like this is the only one that I've seen that's built like this but if there are more they should be advertising them the mesh is the main body or the main underlay material and it's actually like a really wide open celled mesh so I really love that it's going to be very readable it's going to be very flexible it's going to be very forgiving and super easy to break in but what they've wrapped it all with is even better this is not even a collab this is just a regular ass release you know what I'm saying like before when you got a 550 or a 550 High I can't even remember what they called them let me look real quick it was the 650 I was literally going to say 650 like I could have done like the dumbest guess of just like o one extra number but that's what I was going to do and I thought you were going to be like no in my head I was like don't be that stupid do you know what Michael Scott says you miss 100% of the shots that you didn't take this is true say Wy by Michael Scott what the was I even talking about oh that's right but yeah before you'd have to get like a collab version to get materials like this and not this time the materials on here at least the leather is super Supple super nice minorly textured not like heavily textured I really like it it looks good it feels good and also the suede on the toe is awesome the only thing that I can say negative about it is that when they're on feet they do wrinkle up at the toe a little bit weird but it's cuz all of that material is that soft it reminds me of the Mac attacks we did a review on those they did the same thing that soft ass beautiful material that's wrapped around the foot and is so comfortable is so soft it it kind of caves in a little bit and sometimes it looks weird does that make me not want to wear these hell no I really can't wait to break these things out they look awesome and on top of that I love the weird vintage stuff that they got going on like usually I don't like totally love the sale and off-white stuff but this I don't know what it is I don't know if it's just the blue but it looks really good together they even made the end branding look kind of faded and dingy and everything like that even though it's not it's a nice piece of suede as well and yeah I just really like the way that this whole thing came out there's not a material on this that I can say anything bad about because it's all awesome now the tongue is nylon and I really like the way that it looks and feels I will say that the laces are a little bit like long I don't know if anybody else feels that way but every time I try to lace these Loosely the laces are just way too long either way I think that the shoe looks great no matter how you're wearing them cuz I do see people lace them Loosely I don't know if they swap out the laces or I don't know if they're like pulling them like you know what I mean where you can like make them I just don't like the feeling of the laces getting bunched up with my foot like when you have them inside but either way lace loose or lace snuggly is that the is that the work that sounds so snugly yeah snuggly sounds odd they look great either way now as far as fit is concerned I will say going true the size for most will be the move but again they're very slender so keep that in mind this is a shoe that at this this point is kind of like available everywhere so you will have a much better chance finding these in store to try them on just to make sure so go to a Foot Locker a Champs JD Sports what's the other ones Finish Line all that stuff whatever the big box stores are go check them out try them on see if they fit I will say you got to break them in so if you get kind of like claustrophobic initially it does break in over time some people don't want to deal with that though and I completely understand and with that being said do we happen to have time for a good on topic User submitted question of the day this one's a behind the scenes a BTS yes okay are the pop culture edits like Jody's inner dialogues coming out while you guys are filming no you're they're your edits I know but like you want to take a stab edit well I feel like you do the best man you could just do this fine I'll do it it's a question for you no but they were asking you does it say Chris it says like they're asking you they didn't say Jodie are these edits your fine the edits have multi-purpose function to them the most basic way to describe it is it's usually a quick break in between segments that's literally my first answer I made bullet points cool so if you were prepared for this why didn't you answer the question and then the next part is yes it's kind of her perspective or whatever or her thought so if you ever see ducky and she's like yep yep yep that's her literally over there being like she's literally nodding her head as I'm like talking or whatever so those things will tend to be that sometimes it's just for like like it's just funny you know what I mean like I'll say something or something and one of those just works you know what I mean they can also be used to describe a feeling to like finish what I'm thinking so uh it just really depends on what it is there's multiple ways to use those kinds of cuts and I feel like we do our best to use them all am I missing any I'm really impressed with you so okay first off this is unprepared okay everything that I do is off the cuff I will let you know that right now i' I've let people know that before but sometimes they don't believe me every single video not one of them is written rehearsed scripted nothing so I don't even I didn't even know that this was a question first off I I I get surprised I like again them to be very conversational uh so yeah and I didn't even know that you picked a question or made bullet points which you should have just answered proceed okay so to go through the bullet points real quick again sometimes yes it is exactly what comes to my brain while we're filming after doing this for so long like I'm literally editing in my brain as we sit here being like oh this is too long oh this yeah you guys you guys don't see them but I'll say something and I'll look over to her and I'll be like that's not making it is it she's like nope um it is an easy way to end one segment in transition to the next uh sometimes it's just to cover up my own voice because we do have conversations and I feel like you don't need to hear me go mhm or for example we had a movie question last week I can't remember what video it was on maybe it was a 39's I'm not sure but we referenced The Three Musketeers and I screamed out our favorite line trust me you didn't need to hear that sometimes it's to portray what Chris is trying to describe but using a quick visual for example you were describing feeling being hit by a bus and instead I put in so you could just see exactly what you're saying without a 10c explanation of it final bullet point Chris did this whole thing by himself for like 10 years I only came into editing and everything in the last five years 6 years maybe so you were very burnt out at not only Manning the cameras being the spokesperson editing everything down where like you're like I can't even look at myself anymore I still don't like that part and so it's just me being like here this is what I'm going to do with the footage and and if I can make you entertained by yourself like for the most part everybody else should be I am not entertained by me let me make that clear okay if I can look over and see while you're reviewing that something made you laugh like I feel like a million bucks for at least 30 minutes yes that's one of the cut scenes it's not me you know what I'm saying so yeah I am not entertaining A you but you and I but yeah at the end of the day we just do our best to make sneaker videos not monotonous even for me just going over them like it feels sometimes monotonous do I still love what I do of course it's so much fun to talk about the things that you love daily but it's just Rubber and some materials and glue let's make things as if we're really just sitting here chopping it up and that's what we do our best to do with each video hopefully they all work I know that not everybody watches every video so I try to keep that clear mind of like every video is kind of like a hey what's up man and that's just kind of what it is that was a good question they can't answer the the question if they want to ask any other behind the scenes questions they can oh yeah good good idea please leave them down below in the comment section and we will get to them obviously as soon as we can but you know just keep leaving them and we'll see them and eventually they'll make it into a video and with that being said we will catch you guys on the next one so until then y'all have a good one,2025-06-23

JItQ5lFEnlA,Reebok Club C 85 Vintage shoes,now this video is probably going to ruffle some feathers but just remember this is all very personal to me in no way should my experience with these sneakers put you off wearing them or stop you buying them if you love them also my taste changes over time so who knows I might love them again at some point but right now these are the sneakers that I regret buying the most part two if you like this video at any point and it doesn't make you too angry then please feel free to drop it a like and now that's all out the way let's get into the sneakers so so first up we've got my Marella gats so where do I even start with this one this one's a mess okay so the first pair I got of these were too big for me and rather than sending them back for another size I got scared but basically when I was trying them on in my house I was walking around in them as you do when you're trying on shoes and I put some tiny creases in the toe box and because of this I felt like I could no longer send them back so instead I sold them for a loss on Depot I then used the money I got from those plus more to get smaller size and after all of that I've worn them about twice in the last 2 years I love the look of the shoe and I love how they look on others but I can't make them work for me in the way that I want and whenever I see myself in these they don't match up with the look that I've got in my head if that makes sense and coming in at £500 and wearing them twice in the last 2 years does that sound like money well spent to you because it doesn't to me anyway let's move on to another pair of sneakers before I start crying over the amount of money I spent on these next up I've got the Adidas gazelle in the blue colorway so the Adidas gazelle indor is one of my favorite sneakers so I thought it was a good idea to pick it up in multiple colors the first pair I got were in green and I wore them so much I decided to pick them up in the blue color way as well now I actually prefer the color of the blue pair to look at but they're just so bright that I never want to wear them for me the green pair are a lot more subtle and a lot more versatile so if I'm going to wear these sneakers then I'll always wear that pair in fact I've never worn the blue pair out inside the house so they were a waste of money for me but I think the other reason I bought these shoes is they were selling out like hot cakes and because I love the look of them so much I didn't want to miss out on them so I didn't think too much and just bought them but yeah even though I love the look of these sneakers they're just not that wearable for me so that's why they're on this list next up I've got the Adidas sber now I wish these sneakers weren't on this list but they have to be because my feet have never got on with them at first when I was breaking these in they ripped my heels to shreds and they were so painful I looked like an extra from 28 Days Later or The Walking Dead Walking Down the Road in these it wasn't a great look and then after the whole heel shredding phase was over I just find them a little bit too tight and uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time and when I own a pair of shoes like the Adidas gazel that give off a similar look but are a lot more comfortable I'm going to go for those every time it's a shame because I really do love these sneakers and I know a lot of people find them really comfortable so maybe they're just not made for my feet and next up I've got the oniska tiger GSM so if you've been subscribed to my channel for a while now you're probably a bit surprised to see this sneaker on this list because I absolutely loved them and I still do but I think this shoe suited my old style really well when I was into the whole clean cut scandy streetwear kind of look and I've since moved away from that these days I like to go for the more darker and edgier looks and I find this sneaker is too clean cut for that and when I first bought these I was just coming out of my old style and into my new style so they never got the we they deserved and after holding on to these for a good while I finally decided to let them go and give them to a home that would enjoy them more than I would and hopefully they're having the time of their lives with their new owner and getting the love and wear that they deserve but yeah a great pair of shoes and excellent quality too but just not right for me right now but let's move on next up we have my pair of oniska tiger Mexico 66s now it sounds like I don't like onuka tiger sneakers from this video but you couldn't be further from the truth I love their sneakers I think they're incredible but I just think they might not be right for me right now but anyway I picked up a pair of their Mexico 66s in the black and white colorway last summer and since then I've worned them a grand total of zero times whenever I try them on with an outfit I always think to myself yeah they look all right but I think another pair of sneakers would look better or a pair of shoes so I end up swapping them out for whichever pair I think would look better on the plus side I find them really comfortable they feel great on my feed I just can't put my finger on why I don't love them on me anyway unlike my other pair of onx tigers that I thought I would never wear so I sold on I do think this pair will have their time for me so I'm holding on to them but until these do have their moment for me I think they're going to have to go down as a regret next up I have the van skate high and even though I still love them they're going in this list I swear I've said I love every sneaker on this list so far but it's true I wouldn't have bought any of them if I didn't love the look of them in the first place but sometimes things just don't work out as you'd hoped anyway these fit me well and they look cool but there's something about Vans at the moment that's stopping me wanting to wear them and I have two theories about why that might be which I'm going to tell you about now so firstly these remind me of my Converse Chuck 70s and if you didn't know already I'm a massive Converse fan so I'll normally choose to wear those over these every time the other thing is I grew up wearing vans so I kind of associate them with my younger self and I'm not sure if I want that I kind of feel like I'm going backwards whenever I wear them and I want to wear new things does that make sense but on the other hand or foot because I wore Vans growing up I've still got a soft spot for them and that's why I bought these but for the other reasons I just mentioned I've barely worn these and that's why they're on this list now the next one is probably going to upset a lot of you but just remember this is all very personal to me but it's the rebot club c85 now I've had a few pairs of these over my lifetime and I used to absolutely love wearing these shoes and I think the pair I've got currently are my fourth pair but unlike my other pairs I've hardly worn these I still think they're a cool shoe and I still like them but I don't get excited about wearing them these days I think back in the day I used to see this shoe as a slim profile shoe that goes with everything that's really Sleek but since then I've owned so many other sleeker trainers that I don't see them in the same way anymore I think they look a little bit clumsy and a little bit bulky at times and I suppose you could say that adds to their charm but it's just not doing it for me at the moment I'm not really a fan of the way these age either they crease in a way that I don't really like and yeah I probably would have been better off not buying this pair is anyone else with me on this one or are you all screaming at your screens calling me an idiot let me know how you're feeling next up I've got the Adidas hble specials now when I first got these shoes I absolutely loved them and I wanted to wear them all the time they were really comfortable they fit me well and they went with everything but ever since I got my gazelle indoors I feel like all my other Adidas sneakers have taken a bit of a back seat and I don't really need them anymore and I think that's the problem when you buy things that are so similar to one another there'll always be one pair that you like more than the other pairs so whenever you wear the other pairs you think to yourself well these look good but the gazel would look better so I'm just going to wear them instead well that's what I think anyway but then I look at this pair and I think they look absolutely delicious so maybe I'm just bored of my pair in the black colorway but these are too similar to my green gazel so I'm going to have to stop myself buying them but they do look good don't they but after all this would I recommend any of the sneakers on this list yes I would 100% I'd actually recommend all of them providing that you love them and that you'll actually wear them they're all great sneakers they're all classics but I just didn't need to buy all of them I think with the job I'm in I've definitely got carried away with buying more than I need in the past and this is the result of that I'm a lot more careful with my purchases these days and I don't think I bought a pair of sneakers this year yet but I hope you enjoyed this one if you did please do leave the video a like don't forget to hit subscribe and thank you so much for watching see you later,2025-06-19 08:38:09.903097 UTC
LK4qeiapkkE,PUMA Suede,now those first two shoes I'm probably not going to buy but this next pair I definitely have on my radar these are going to be the Puma suede Squirtles or the Squirtle Squad suedes the Squirtle suedes yeah there you go the Squirtle suedes they're definitely uh more in line like with what I like to wear I love Puma suedes to begin with they're a really really good shoe for daily beating so that sounds horrible daily beating they're a really good shoe to make your daily beaters and I love Squirtle Squirtle evolves into my favorite Pokemon of all time Blastoise so this is kind of a no-brainer to try and go for,2025-06-23 14:42:15.888730 UTC
DnQol9Y0OaU,Vans Old Skool,oh [Applause] so this is it it's the van's old school not the old school pro it's just the old school um i'm not sure why i went to the van store to try and buy an old school pro but they only had the old schools now um there is a couple of differences between the old school and the pro one being the tag here is now checkered used to be red used to match the same sticker on the back here uh the inside kind of a small note to make it's now white instead of black with a little checker design on the heel which is actually kind of cool otherwise the shoe is pretty similar i love the vans old schools i've been wearing them for a really long time and bought so many pairs of them so this review is going to be very biased i'm going to try and poke out some things i don't like about them as well which is very hard because i like them a lot but i will find something some cons to go along with all the pros in the old school so let's start with the number one reason why i love the vans old school so much and that being that i have very wide feet a lot of the skate shoes i've tried are very tight especially around the middle of the foot which is so painful when you're trying to do flips and landing and jumping off your board i found that eventually a lot of the skate shoes will stretch um and will become like the perfect fit but there's a lot of pain that goes along with that you're kind of like a geisha girl for a little bit just uh destroying your feet trying to fit into these skate shoes so back to the point the reason i love them so much is because the vans they have a very wide profile so if you're someone who's got wide big feet like i have these shoes are great they're probably going to be really good for you should give them a go because you can just step right into these and start skating straight away there's no um you know hoping they're gonna stretch i've had a couple of shoes that i've worn hoping they'd stretch and then my toenail falls off after a month or so so these are really cool you can just step into them and go skate another main selling point to these shoes is the laces um i don't know how they've done it it must be just the position of where they put them maybe it's because it is a wide shoe that you've got more suede and more kind of like shoe there to protect the laces but these laces just don't break like brand new board brand new shoes you can go like a few months without breaking a lace which is just like amazing because i absolutely hate it when you have to stop a session change your lace go skate again and then in half an hour you're already breaking a few laces like a few of the laces here that just like destroys the session for me so the fact that these laces last so long just takes your mind off of your gear and lets you just concentrate on the skating and finally before we get into any skateboarding another great thing about these shoes is the waffle cup which vans is pretty well known for um this sole is absolutely incredible it's like you can just feel it when they're brand new your fingers almost squeak on them they're so grippy and and that might be a good thing and a bad thing i love it because of the grip um but if it's a really soft kind of a plastic or rubber whatever it is that might wear away faster than other shoes there we go i knew i'd find a con but the sole is incredible the uh the grip you get straight off the bat is just incredible that combined with the duracap which is this vulcanized sole um compared to the cup sole where they literally just take a kind of molded sole and just stick it to the bottom of the shoe i much prefer this style where they have this the sole and then they wrap that in plastic or rubber and that just gives such a better board control so the dura cap is what um vans calls their vulcanized shoes time to get into some skateboarding and we'll see how these shoes are i already know but you're gonna see how they are oh yeah new shoes they just feel so good they just make you feel like you got so much swag but uh they also feel weird new shoes like they they feel so flat and so rigid feel a little bit strange let's try and loosen them up a bit with a let's do a straight eight i totally lied there was nothing straight about that straight that took me ages oh but anyways shoes feel nice and loose now feel good it's weird to get over that first phase where like the shoes are so ridiculously grippy so it's good like now they feel like they're worn in just a little bit and i'm used to that extra grip all right let's do some more skating some more product testing put them through their paces let's uh try no slide shove it out that count no that doesn't count that's terrible oh my god ride my shin there it is god these shoes feel good i'm gonna try and hit this curved rail here that never gets skated and then maybe a back tail oh [ __ ] oh i blame the shoes bloody shoes there it is ah you're right actually so yeah i wanted to film this review over a couple of days because i wanted to get a good feel for the shoes like i know them pretty well but you know i just wanted to give them a really good skate again with a critical mind this time first of all let's take a look at how the shoes look after one day of skating so all right definitely losing some grip over here kind of chewing it up but overall good laces not a mark at all which is incredible no switch game really not yet a little bit something i've noticed with these ones i don't know if like they're different to the old ones the old school pro but they feel a lot looser around the heel like not so much the the bit here this feels nice and tight it's this area down here it feels really big and there's a lot of space so i don't know what that's about i don't know if like as they wear and they lose their shape a bit then they get a bit more comfortable but yeah that's kind of like throwing me off a bit they feel almost a bit too spacey in the back there so i'm here at norton skate park to try out these shoes again there's a bit more stuff here so you can give you a better view we're looking at sorry i'm really out of breath i've been skating for a while that's what it looks like i'm gonna try and get a few lines here and uh do the set a bit i want to try out the pop kush and see how that feels on my heel yeah let's try and get another line um maybe finish off with a tray flip oh oh people have got their nice cars out today little board slide and then nose manual come on oh there it is so i've had these shoes for about one week now and i feel like i've given them a really good skate and yeah i feel like i've got a good understanding of what this shoe can do i didn't think i was gonna find anything wrong with it but there is some cons which i'll get to but the pros obviously the good parts which i mentioned already about being able to skate it really quickly it's nice and wide um it's got amazing grip um yeah it just holds out really well you saw me doing the stair set which i have not done a long time because i'm definitely in the dad category of skateboarders now i've also got a kit coming in november so i'm definitely in the dad category in november but the pop kush performs really well as always nice thick uh i don't even know what this material is kind of foam pop kush fantastic durability it's going to last you a long time which is in my opinion something very attractive especially if you're starting out in skateboarding this stuff is expensive these shoes were like 100 bucks 100 bucks canadian and in one week i'm already destroying them so you know for me this shoe is just such a great shoe because it just feels so solid solid and grippy and for me obviously it's different for everyone but i just feel like i can trust my shoe which is really important i know that sounds weird but like when you're rolling up to a set or up to a rail you want to have full confidence that when you pop that board is coming with you and it's going to land in exactly the right place that you can have your balance and then land and roll away and these shoes they do that for me there's just something about the shape something about the the design of it that just fits my foot so well let's get to some cons because there is a few that i was quite surprised about so there is a lot of wear on the nose here the nose what the hell am i talking about the the front the toe of the shoe just there i was skateboarding today and a piece of rubber just flapped off and was flinging around like this i'm really off putting and i look down there's a hole in my shoe and it's weird it's not all the way through to my foot but that brings me on to the next point because i feel like this time around instead of the vulcanized edge just coming straight up and stopping they wrap it around the top a bit see how the lip it kind of wraps around which is a little bit off-putting when you're skateboarding i have to say it feels like there's a little bit less board control than the last old school pro that i had the classic this all vans do this when you've got this white stripe along the edge here all of them do this they start peeling away that's common that will happen to your shoes too the canvas just here is starting to get the little the classic what do you call that bit of your foot the tiny knuckle on your small toe starting to wear through there but it's okay because once you go through this canvas there's a layer of like waterproof rubber which is really durable and you won't go through that so definitely if you're a wide footed skateboarder i would definitely recommend a vans old school or the old school pro if they're still doing that it's an amazing shoe it's definitely a historic shoe vans has been around since the beginning a little fun fact the off-the-wall that saying is from the old days when people used to skate the bowls and when they were carving the edges replicating waves and doing cutbacks on waves when they first started catching air at the top of the bowls that was vans off the wall they didn't even call it an air bag then they just called it off the wall so it's kind of cool like nice little history piece there you know let me know in the comments below what you think of the vans old school um i'd like to know your feedback everyone's experience is different obviously and i'd be really interested to hear what you think of them even if you think they're awful i want to hear it let's start a discussion about the old school i want this channel to be kind of a community where we can discuss certain things about skateboards skateboarding help people who are wanting to get into the sport and just generally skateboarders sharing information that's kind of like where i want to take this so yeah leave a comment hit the subscribe button and i'll see you next time when i do another video bye guys,2025-06-23

vSp2rwZf70w,New balance 550,oh yes the new balance 550 one of the most hyped shoes this year the question is why and why are they so expensive and why am i a size seven and a half i feel like i actually have bigger feet than that but i don't also why is everybody honking hello everyone um let me move this it's a mess in here hello everyone welcome to the new balance 550 review from the iron snail which basically means if you are looking to get a pair of these shoes and you think wow those look amazing and trendy they're most likely not if they've gotten to me they're outdated and nobody's wearing them anymore today we'll be looking at the new balance 550s and i'll tell you all about them from their inception to why they failed to why they came back and they are now the most popular shoe in the world and also the only other well maybe not the only other thing also they're not the most popular shoe in the world those would probably be feet there is something on these shoes that new balance changed for the first time that made them more successful but ultimately like i said they did fail so also today's an exciting day because my friend brendan will be joining us at prospect park and the goal at prospect park is to tan these legs because they're currently looking pretty gross especially when i wear a mostly beige outfit also great news this video is sponsored by huckberry so today we'll be talking about the flint and tinder 365 pants in corduroy straight fit which actually are probably my best fitting pants but we'll talk about those later i won't be wearing them in the actual video because like i said it's like 90 degrees outside part of the reason that these came back was because of the beautiful mysterious teddy santis a man that is so trendy he is one of the people that has an instagram with zero post and just a white profile picture and that's it it's so trendy and mysterious i wonder what he'll do next and he capitalized on the kind of retro 80s and 90s coming back but he neutralized the entire color palette and we'll get more into that later but he brought these shoes back hello what's up bubby do you put this under over your shirt hello youtube it's post filming video michael i'm here just in case i got a little too goofy with brendan and i need to bring us some clarity about what is actually happening in the video so you may see me a few times wow are you following we did this once before about club seed how's it going and the i messed up the audio so we're doing it again brendan's being very gracious and doing it for me again okay so brief history about new balance new balance was formed in 1906 in boston massachusetts which is close to where i'm from i'm from cape cod and then 83 years later they came out with the new balance 50s in 1989 and they immediately exploded onto the scene and flopped and no one bought them and they died and what's important about these shoes or what was important when they were released and why new balance thought they would be so famous is that the model prior to these did not have perforated leather so when you're on the court your feet got sweaty because these are basketball shoes but they flopped for a very specific reason do you think these glasses look dumb by the way i lost my cool ones and i got these at cvs they they take them off they don't look dumb but you look better with them off anyways um wow you know like sunglasses don't replace the beauty of human eyes but they do for some people that have ugly eyes who has ugly eyes oh i could list at least 100 people the reason that these shoes failed was because at the time well still not at the time but nike is a massive company converse is a massive company and very big brands like this could do something that new balance could not but also new bounds kind of messed up too these were developed by stephen smith not to be confused with stan smith who has a shoe named after him but did not design the stan smiths from adidas that's a lot that is a lot steven smith was a very prolific designer he did stuff for nike reebok converse everybody the reason that these shoes didn't blow up right away is two things one of them was steven smith's fault but also a new balance as well but the first one was just these very rich companies like nike and converse and whoever it may be for example could afford to have celebrities wear their shoes on the court so everybody saw those and they didn't really see a lot of these the other misstep which seems like new balance was trying to predict where shoes could go basketball shoes could go is that everybody in the nba was wearing high tops these are low tops so it was kind of people just wrote it off and were like okay well those are not high tops so less support for my ankles not as good that's very muscular oh you think that guy's muscular look at that guy over there you got it oh awesome yeah i know that guy could kill godzilla and now presenting huck berry um hello this video is sponsored by huckberry as i said specifically the flint and tinder 365 pants and these ones are in cord and straight fit and these are my best fitting straight fit pants i've ever worn so far so that is very exciting for someone like me who wears pants but these are eight ounce corduroy which in denim eight ounces is very light but in corduroy it feels pretty good just because the texture of it is different so it feels like a medium weight fabric but you can wear it all year round it's also 98 cotton two percent spandex but you can't really feel the stretch if you're like pulling it with your hands it doesn't feel like elastic pants or anything like that so that's nice to get a little bit more flexibility and comfort as well and added to the comfort is that these are piece dyed so most clothes the threads are actually dyed first and then woven into a fabric and then the fabric is made these are dyed after the fabric is made so it gives the pants a little bit more softness than they would normally have did i say softness with an accent oh no these are fantastic pants i like to wear them with my black boots so you'll probably see all the b-roll i'm wearing my pretty black boots that would make no sense considering that i am reviewing footwear in this video so anyways i love these pants and i love that the buttons look like bullets just in case i need to scare someone and say i have a bullet pointing at myself possibly the most important part is what i forgot you have to use my link if you buy these otherwise huckberry won't know that you took my good word you know how much i paid for these now i paid 260 for these which you actually didn't think was that bad of a price no it's actually that's not how much i paid look if i go on the goat i go to my shoes here i paid 127 dollars for them the construction of these is fantastic like i said before in the great video is that when you first get shoes and they're like not bent and the leather is very stiff they feel very much like art and i don't want to wear them do you know what i'm saying but i did wear them i wore them today it was very i felt very tough doing it the construction of these is fantastic and i think the leather contrary to a lot of other leathers and contrary to basically what adidas is doing right now which is shifting their leather shoes over to mushroom leather which is like a fiber of mushrooms coated in plastic these are pigskin i believe and i believe that because of two things number one is that the made in usa new balances which you have a pair of right are made of pigskin so i would assume that these are made of pigskin because pigskin leather is very thin but it's also very very tough so it's a bit more flexible and it's a bit more breathable than calf leather or cow leather depending on how old the cow is this looks very thin and then as you can see along this side right here it's kind of bluish that is because this is chrome dyed leather which is very good for water resistance it's very good if you want to dye leather a certain color because it will stay that color for a long time and it's very good at absolutely decimating the environment and being one of the worst pollutants that mankind has made so that's good it's done using chromium salts really yes which is absolutely yeah that sounds horrible yeah it's really bad this is not a specific thing to new balance most leather is actually chrome tan so you can do research into it i'm sure some companies handle it in a more environmentally friendly way just wanted to mention it before michael had been pointing out some of the nice like eco-friendly moves that new balance had been keen to do such as they have an ortholite ecosole ecosol do you want to know why it's eco-friendly because five percent of the rubber used on the ecosole is recycled and they use something called bio oil which is their version of oil that i don't particularly know what it is but it's not petroleum-based so it's not actually using oil so super eco-friendly right superhuman now close your eyes okay and picture what chromium salts look like in a big bat or the light soils are actually basically used everywhere i bet some brands pay more to white label it so you don't know it's from ortholite but these are ortholite soles proudly advertised by new balance and the nice part about ortholite which we discussed may just be how soles are in general is that the cushion will only compress five percent over time so they'll always stay comfortable and kind of spongy and that spongy this is also great because it lets in airflow so your feet stay cooler hello hey is this brendan yes yeah hey brother how's it going i was going all right how are you oh good the only other thing i forgot to mention on the actual like construction quality of these shoes is that they the soles the outer soles are glued on and then stitched down which i find very important as compared to well injection molded is good because it's actually molded onto the shoe so the soles won't pop off but if it's just glued on i find that usually structurally they you know you get that soul flap after a while yeah i have so far yeah on your shoes right now there's a glue down right there's no stitching no yeah so i don't like that i'm not a big fan of that i do like the stitching because it prevents that you know all the stitches could pop off and then it could still happen but i like the fact that typically that won't happen new balance 550 agility and speed test take one go 3.56 what was my other one the other one yeah way slower these are fast shoes anyways though that is about it i will see you all next week brendan thank you for joining me in this video um you want to hear a quick sad story i ordered mochi balls because i figured i'll treat myself today i never buy ice cream and the grubhub delivery woman bought me it was called salt of the earth pud and i think because i couldn't find where you'd order this on grubhub it came from a totally different place i think my grubhub driver just bought this from some store and took it out of her fridge and drove it to me,2025-06-23 14:50:46.600977 UTC
3aM1mUg9rf8,Reebok Club C 85 Vintage shoes,okay so here we are talking about shoes yet again and this time i want to talk about my top four vintage inspired shoes so if you've been here before you know that i am enamored with minimal shoes that's my thing i love minimal shoes i'm always seeking them out i've done quite a few videos on them so i thought i'd change it up a little bit and something else i love here is vintage style throwback stuff and so i came across a bunch of shoes that i just really liked and made me hanker back to a different time and i want to showcase those for you but first my name is timothy sands and this is fashionable father if you're one of the lucky early subscribers welcome back if you're new here i present content to inspire men to present their best selves that intrigues you subscribe if you're so inclined okay so first up is cariuma i think that's how you pronounce it these are made in brazil they're a skater shoe so when i first saw them i was thinking oh yeah vans all day but since they're made in brazil they got this cool style to them yes look at that branding it's pretty bold but also just sleek enough and cool enough for me the cream color that throws back it has this like very utilitarian like canvas on them that i'm loving now yes they are a skater shoe through and through like the soles are built for skating they have um a reinforced like flip i don't skate so does that make me a poser do people still use the term poser i don't know anyways um i love it i like the concept of it i think they would look great with cropped pants they have again this awesome vintage throwback feel to them they're also a cool company they claim that they take care of their employees that the work environment is good and also they plant two trees for every shoe they sell so that's pretty cool okay so up next we got another tennis shoe you can see where i'm going with this and these are clay deans i've featured clay here before i like their shoe i like the company they're based right here in la what i love about these though is i feel like they got this adidas feel to them or adidas i should say but yeah but just cooler and sleeker and i like the color on the back you can get different colors i think there's blue i got the green the cream sole is so so cool and again it's kind of got this vintage feel to it not a gum sole which is really popular right now i feel i actually really really feel in that cream the details on it are nice and refined and i think that's also what's cool about this is it's got a vintage feel but it's also sleek and and pretty nicely detailed with the suede and of course amazing leather that you could really dress this shoe up you could wear it with a nice pair of trousers of course you could wear it with some jeans and maybe even rock them with some slacks i don't know if i'd go as far as with a suit maybe maybe a casual suit these could go well with okay next up i went a little rogue got a little different and got me a slipper that's right look at that now this anchors back to my minimal shoes it barely has a sole on them it literally is a slipper but you know how things are right now they're wearing these out and about it doesn't have enough of a sole that you can wear them you know in the streets don't don't wear them in any weather but i know what you're thinking vintage what's vintage about these these remind me of you old man wearing his slippers around the house and of course i know you gen z norm core fashion types are going to love this concept looking like an old man and dressing dressing down but this also such a sleek cool slipper that you can rock with anything if you ask me now you know me i love me some minimalism and i love this minimal design it is deer skin so that's ridiculous and it's ridiculously soft and ridiculously comfortable but yeah i feel like you can rock these with a lot of different things obviously as i'm alluding to rock it with some norm core but you can also rock it with a suit you can rock it with some trousers you can rock it with some slacks you can rock it with a robe i don't know okay that was weird i just lost power in my house and then turned all back on okay so what was i talking about you can rock these with trousers you can rock these with slacks you can rock these with suits you can rock with this with a robe i think i said that earlier anyways um yeah i love these i think these are a cool very sleek shoe and i like the vintage feel to them i i think these slippers anchor back to what your old man would wear up next are my favorite might already know what i'm talking about if you paid attention at all but i had to do a little journey to go get them i decided why why buying them online when you can go maybe find them in the city so let's go back in time and join me on my journey into la over two that's right the grove we haven't been there in a year probably plus yeah are you excited i'm excited to get out of here so [Applause] so do [Applause] we got some shoes we got makeup i was trying i was really trying to get her to try something on in northern gyms she refused so terrible she's refused they're awful they're holding my size right aren't these just so cool so unlike the other shoes in the video these are definitely full on vintage these these shoes i feel like my brother owned a pair when i was growing up yeah reebok club c85s now they come in multiple colors the really cool color is the cream with the turquoise and um i couldn't i don't think they had those well they didn't have those at j crew so i just wanted to make sure i got a pair and i loved them i fell in love with him as soon as i saw him look at that badge on the toe that is so cool that is so cool and i just reeboks were so they were the shoe like nike was passe like no one was even wearing nike and everybody's wearing reeboks and then like michael jordan descended from the heavens and got jordan errors going or whatever they were and nike just took over at that point and reebok didn't have a chance but for a while man these were the only shoes on the block and i love them i think they're really cool i love the style of them i actually was kind of shocked how much i was going to like them i thought it was like eh they're cool they're a throwback shoe nah i'm loving them i think they're sweet i love the style of them i love all the stitching and the design and it just you know does bring back memories and i feel like these were more of like a late 80s shoe not exactly into the 90s so i kind of miss the boat on these and and i love them and and i i love the style on them they're just cool you can wear these with shorts you can wear these with jeans you can wear them with some trousers i would not rock these with a suit that's for sure blue trousers with that right there i mean come on you can't go wrong with that and i love the design of the of the suede right here the gray suede you can tell i'm enamored and it's all right so so those are my top four vintage styled shoes for this spring take a look at them i'm excited by them i think they're gonna be shoes that you're going to want to rock coming out of this crazy last year and and having some fun times out there and enjoying your fashion for the first time in a long time right all right so my name is timothy sands and this is my story of fashion and fatherhood if you've been watching this long you gotta hit the like button it helps me out and also helps with the algorithm and if you like this video probably like this video right here this has to do with my top sustainable shoes and that one is pretty entertaining too and it kind of goes rogue and it doesn't you know not one of my normal shoe videos about minimal shoes and always remember never forget style first see on the flip side,2025-06-19 08:38:09.748352 UTC
kngti4c1Yug,Nike Air Max 90,okay so here we have a classic this is the nike air max 90. this is probably literally one of the best shoes i'm so happy i was just scrolling through i can't remember what i was doing and this ad popped up i'm an older dude so if you remember the 90s if you remember what um look how awesome this shoe is oh my god look at the cushioning the comfort the style the nuance oh it smells amazing the leather this is one of the best shoes i'm so excited by this shoe you have no idea you can wear this for athletics you could wear this with a pair of jeans out on the town a night out with your girl or whatever it's absolutely phenomenal it's one of the most comfortable shoes i've literally ever worn and i highly highly recommend it oh i love this shoe,2025-06-23 11:26:31.702322 UTC
vg3zEAQlbL8,Yeezy 350 v2,on monday we were all blessed with some new yeezy 350s they dropped the all-over white pair and then an all-over blacked-out pair and then i started getting questions from you guys asking which one is better which one should i keep well today we're gonna find out okay yes guys we are doing double everything today we got both of them in the building boxes and everything exactly the same nothing has changed here you will see i guess the kind of new thing that's changed recently um instead of yeezy fully spelt out it just says yzy 350 v2 don't ask me why they did that it's just a random small chain either way this pair right here oh we got the crispy all white this is the bone yeezy 350. we got another one though this guys is the blacked out onyx yeezy 350. and guys i thought this was going to be a no-brainer for me as someone who loves triple white sneakers and wears them a lot i thought i was definitely going to choose these but after getting this onyx pair in hand it's got me asking myself the same question which one do i want which one do i prefer of course before we figure all of that out i do need to hit you guys with some release details uh both colorways dropped on monday that was the 20th of june was pretty weird having yeezy 350s drop on a monday which normally just takes place on a friday or a saturday i don't know yeezy releases are literally all over the place at the moment like currently the uk and the eu are getting a restock of the blue tint yeezy 350 that's something that dropped out in the u.s like six months ago and it's also important to mention that this is a restock release of the yeezy 350 bone like these dropped i think two months ago so we're already getting another restock of this pair either way both of these colorways retail at the new higher 200 pounds here in the uk and 230 dollars out in the us i think it's pretty safe to say that there was a decent amount of stock like i got a bunch of messages from people saying that they managed to get a pair so i just think that there was a lot of pairs available i will say that this onyx colorway was an adidas confirmed app exclusive so there was no other raffles for this colorway and obviously it was the first time that this one dropped just technically this onyx colorway was the more limited out of the two but if you think about it we've had a lot of blackish colorways of the yeezy 350. i mean breads black static cinder mx rock mono cinder and i guess you could kind of count all of the striped variations like the dazzling blue or the oreos that dropped but all white 350s aren't as common i mean in terms of a true comparison the only one would be the 2016 cream pair i mean you could include the statics but in terms of just plain old white those would really be the only two color ways that we got i will say that they did this onyx colorway really really well it is just blacked out it's not like some of the other sneakers that we've had being called onyx by easy brand where they have like undertones of different colors these are just straight up blacked out this bone colorway while look super bright and solid white when you're wearing them there is some cream undertone so it's not exactly like the brilliant white that you've seen on other sneakers i guess in terms of practicality when you're comparing the two obviously the all over black colorway is going to hold up a lot better in terms of getting dirt and scuffs it's not really going to show up as much as i guess an all-over white sneaker this all over white colorway can definitely appear pretty thrashed over i guess a shorter period of time not to mention the fact that yeezy 350s when they're in this kind of all over white color they tend to yellow over time honestly getting all white sneakers dirty has never stopped me from wearing them so i guess it is kind of down to personal preference it is summer now so potentially the all over white colorway might be a little bit more compelling to go with your summer outfits but obviously that doesn't mean just because this is an all-over black sneaker that you can't wear it in the summer it's perfectly fine and i think you can make these look pretty hard with a summer outfit as well in terms of materials both these colorways are identical so there's nothing splitting your decision there it is the thinner slightly more stretchy knit material that we've seen on colorways of the past on the 350 like the zions or the israel fills it does have the semi-translucent plastic material that is on the side in a stripe obviously on this black tail colorway you cannot see into the shoe however on the all-over white colorway you can and it really just depends what color socks you're wearing because you can really see through that window thankfully both of these colorways have pull tabs which i'm a huge fan of i definitely prefer the look of a yeezy 350 with a pull tab even though i guess it's not the biggest deal for some people obviously these being like the most simple of simple colorways that you can put on a yeezy 350 they are both extremely wearable they both go with pretty much any color i mean me being a fan of all white sneakers i'm gonna be wearing these hard this summer quite often just running errands going to the gym just as a daily sneaker honestly they're both really solid options in terms of simplicity i think these are like the most popular yeezy 350s it is literally something anybody can wear it's so basic it's so comfortable and they just are so good looking honestly i wasn't expecting to like the onyx colorway as much as i do no it's just a plain black easy 350 but there's something about it when it's on foot it just looks so clean so yeah i gotta say this is a tough decision which one you want to pick you're just gonna have to pull the trigger on one of them hey maybe you got the cash to get both they're crazy enough you might just want to throw the white pair on the right and chuck the blacks on the left and just rock them with the panda style now as for sizing even though this is the slightly thinner knit material than past easy 350s i would still say go a half size up or just stick with whatever your regular yeezy 350 size is but yeah guys listen i need to know down in the comment section which one would you pick and why let me

IHltoBT6Hqk,Adidas Samba,one of my favorite sneakers of all time is the adidas Samba classic why because it's a beautiful durable and versatile pair of shoes there's just something about these simple yet elegant design you have an all leather upper with the word Samba printed in gold on top of that there is a suede overlay knit decorates the toe portion of the body my favorite design feature of course is the gum rubber sole of the sneakers now I know people say they dislike the longer tongue on classic Samba but to me that's not that big of a hindrance you can simply adjust it to your preferred height it takes some tinkering but at the end of the day it's a simple fix in total all these design features deliver a beautiful and versatile sneaker that can be adorned with a variety of different outfits and styles the classic Samba like most of you use are very comfortable to wear you can walk in them most of the day but little to no discomfort let's not forget that these sneakers were designed with soccer in mind so it can handle some physical activity when it comes to it if you're wearing them as casual footwear like me they can definitely go the distance today I want to show you the shoes from an honest worn perspective as you can see here there is some scuffing here and there from everyday use but overall these shoes have held up very well all in all the Samba classic is well deserving of its name and status as a fashionable and stylish sneaker that has withstood the test of time decade after decade and it still remains as relevant today as it did in the past at the end of the day I think we all can agree that the adidas Samba is indeed with no pun intended a classic whether you get these sneakers or not that's up to you I'm just here to inform you from my perspective the consumers perspective let me know what your thoughts are in the comments and as always thanks for watching until next time I'm out if you're new to the channel and are interested in more content like this be sure to like subscribe or share the video click on the notification value to stay up to date as well thanks,2025-06-19 08:41:01.922927 UTC
kAFLivTRRSQ,Nike Dunk Panda,one of the cringiest trends in sneaker culture in the past few years has been the haes on the panda dunk and so I thought we would celebrate berding ourselves of this trend by making fun of the different types of sneaker heads that hate on the panda no doubt you guys have seen countless videos of people being interviewed at Sneaker shows where they are asked the question what's the worst sneaker release of all time what's the worst sneaker of all time the worst sneaker least of all time worst sneaker of all time and almost without fail every other person says the worst sneaky release of all time is the panda dunk the pandas the mother Panda dunk n pandas we might need to get them up out of here it's so cringe it's so predictable and it is filled with irony worst sneaker of all time you know Panda dunks all of these people hate on the panda dunks because they are a trend but at this point every other person is hating on the panda dunks making it a trend unto itself and so the same people that are hating on a popular Trend are themselves taking part in a popular Trend more sneaker release all time the pandas the pandas are ruining sneaker culture bro the first type of person that hates on the panda dunk is the type of person that just can't stand it when something becomes popular these are the same type of people that really love a song or a movie or a TV series as long as nobody else is talking about it but as soon as that song starts to be popular as soon as people start talking about that same movie or TV series they swiftly move on and then denounce it these are the type of people that are only interested in something as long as it is cool underground and not being spoken about the next type of person that hates on the panda dunk is going to be the sneaker reseller we all know that resellers are Keen to gas up sneakers so as to continue to keep the demand high but as soon as that same sneaker is available and everybody has a pair they no longer want to gas them up and in fact we'll quickly turn to tearing them down next up we have the bandwagoner the bandwagoner is an interesting one it's usually the type of person that can't really think for themselves if you asked this person to give you a reason as to why they hate the panda without referencing its popularity they couldn't give you a straight answer quite often times these are kids or grown men with kids brains the irony of course with this type of hater is they will denounce the panda as the worst sneaker release of all time whilst simultaneously wearing pandas or a very similarl looking sneaker you know panad dunks next up you have the gatekeeper this is usually an old head type of sneaker head that looks at the panda as a kind of Gateway sneaker the gatekeeper can't stand the fact that so many more people are getting interested into sneakers via the panda dunk now think about it for a moment what really is so bad about the panda dunk I mean just look at it it's a classic silhouette in a very accessible wearable colorway how can you possibly say this thing is ugly so let's take a good look at some of these people don't walk up to me with no pandas on you're not a fan not at all cheapest ugliest most basic Okay who wants the basic bit first of all this guy is high as hell I think unless this guy is holding a sign up saying free Lamborghinis he's not going to have to worry about any type of girl running up on him I will say though I give respect for wearing the Ben 13s you meet a girl for the first time what's the worst sneaker she could be wearing pandas this guy already had the response lined up as soon as she started asking the question he already knew what he had to say if you meet a girl for the first time what's the worst shoe she could be wearing pandas BR this young man is the perfect example of what I was talking about before look at what he's wearing he's not wearing Panda dunks but he's wearing a very similar colorway to the panda dunks just think about how stupid this is you're saying this particular sneaker is the worst sneaker release of all time and you have a shoe on that is nonon identical a girl for the first time what's the worst sneaker she could be wearing worst sneaker she be wearing I got to say the panda dunks right I'm not fashionable all right in fact I'm like the antonym of trendy but this guy right here I mean this is some get dressed in the dark type stuff going on right here and let's also not forget that bro has himself on some SB Dunks he's got dunks on cuz everyone has them and they're below almost Below Retail already and notice how he says they're below retail as if the resale value of a sneaker has any bearing on its aesthetic appeal this is another thing that's problematic with a lot of these sneaker Tes is that so many of us have become conditioned to value a sneaker based solely on its resale value rather than how cool it looks so how it makes us feel you were to meet a girl for the first time what's the worst shoe she could be wearing the worst shoe uh what would you say the pandas another person saying that a dunk is the worst sneaker of all time whilst simult multaneously wearing dunks what's the worst shoe she could be wearing Panda dunks I mean this guy's got the big red boots on come on the only reason he's wearing the big red boots is because they were a trend for a minute they went viral everybody had a PE and so to denounce a sneaker as being the worst of all time just because it's popular in Trendy whilst wearing a sneaker that's only cool because it was trendy for a minute is the height of hypocrates worst sneaker of all time I'm going to have to go with pandas again go with pandas again she knows this is a common take she knows this is a bot take and yet again another person denouncing dunks whilst simultaneously wearing dunks now I've only of just taken a few examples here these are ones that I just happened to come across in the past day or two if you go onto these pages and search out Panda dunk hate or whatever you will find an absolute plethora of videos just like this and so I think it's safe to say that a lot of the hate that's generated towards Panda dunks has been generated because it is a trend to hate on them which is as with discovered in this video the heights of irony considering that the reason that these cats hate on them is because they're trendy it is a nice shoe it is a clean colorway incredibly wearable it's of very little wonder that the shoe is as popular as it is now that it's accessible and people can't make money off them reselling them they have been democratized meaning anyone and everyone can get a pair of them now if they want to and so because they're no longer valuable or rare or coveted people don't want to show them love anymore and I think that is cringe I think the PA P dunks are fine in fact I'm almost Keen to go and get myself a pair just to beat up at this point but let me know what you guys think about the panda hates down below because I think after this video we can now draw a line under it it is done it is dead let's move on thank you guys as always for taking the time to watch the video hope you had some fun hope you had a couple of laughs and I will see you on the next video take care for now and peace,2025-06-23

72oWvFUXZFM,Yeezy 350 v2,one of the most anticipated Yeezy boosts of the last couple years is finally releasing this month in August 2023 I'm happy to say it's pretty decent what's up everybody I'm Seth Fowler and today I'm reviewing the upcoming Adidas Yeezy boost 350 V2 Granite so we've been seeing leaks of this shoe and images of this shoe since the middle of last year maybe even earlier and obviously because of everything that went down between Adidas and Kanye West while this shoot was supposed to release at the end of last year they're finally releasing it now alongside tons of other Yeezys in August 2023 and while I'd love to say this shoe is worth the wait it's just kind of a standard easy boost 350 V2 and if you were looking forward to this shoe great you can finally grab it however the problem is because we are forced to wait so long and because this is probably one of the last easy boost 350 V2s to ever release the hype on this shoe has increased now that doesn't mean that this shoe is going to resell for tons of money it just means that if you miss out on a pair of these guys unfortunately you will probably have to buy them at resale instead of having them sit in stores like 350s were doing last year I don't know if you guys remember that but it happened and that also means because you might have to buy these shoes at resale you're gonna have to pay over retail because you're gonna have to pay things like fees stockx has a fee goat has a fee eBay as a fee they all fees all that to say you might have to spend like 20 or 30 more dollars on this shoe than you would have if they had released last year that being said the good news is if you're willing to buy these shoes right when they release you shouldn't have too hard of a time because they're releasing a lot of stock at places like takeout and why which is linked in the description below and also on the Adidas confirmed app we've also got Apothecary no show socks dropping this weekend on apothecary.com which are perfect for Yeezys because they sit just below the easy ankle line and they never slip off your feet plus they're super comfortable and actually speaking of the release these shoes officially release on August 14th for a retail price of 230 dollars which seems to be the standard price for Yeezy boost 350 V2s at this point it used to be 200 and then 220 and now it's 230. I guess to be fair it's not gonna be the retail price for these shoes much longer because we're not getting any more I've got to be honest over the last probably year to two years I haven't really worn any 350 V2s regularly just because there are so many other shoes releasing that in my opinion are more exciting and that doesn't mean in any way that they're bad shoes they've kind of become like Air Force Ones they're very common very easy to find and even non-seater heads welcome and this Yeezy 350 sock shoe style while initially very polarizing has become a very standard look for sneakers in fact for years Adidas was making shoes it looked very similar to this and that was pretty much all they released and now in 2023 it seems like that promise that Kanye made back in 2015 is finally true everyone who wants a pair of Yeezys can pretty much grab them maybe for resale but resale is not too bad but there still is definitely a following behind 350 V2s whether that's people who missed out on pairs years ago when they were incredibly popular or people who just like the design or the comfort of the shoe and in my opinion out of all of the colorways of 350 b2s that have released over the last couple months and even maybe the last couple years this one might be the best now of course that's my own personal opinion but I really do love this colorway and I feel like it's one of the better color ways to drop in a long time but diving into the new 350 V2 Granite the latest Yeezy boost 350 V2 to release you'll notice that the upper of this shoe is actually very similar to the original 350 V2 zipper even though we've had countless variations of V2 uppers the original upper is still my favorite and when you compare it to the original Beluga 350 V2 you'll notice that they've still got that class stripe on the side the knit pattern is the same even though they're really only using two colors of material in the upper of The Shoe versus like three or four and there's something about the Simplicity of the shoe that I really like now I'm currently working on my review of the Yeezy boost 350 V2 MX dark salt and compared to this shoe you can see that the upper of the shoe went a lot crazier even though it's really only like Grays and blacks and things like that there's just so much more going on in the shoe than this shoe and I just prefer the Simplicity of this shoe as I mentioned before the upper of this shoe is almost identical to that of the original 350 V2 it's made up entirely of primeknit however you've got different knit patterns woven into the upper of the shoe a majority of the Prime knit material comes in this sort of greenish gray which I actually really like online the images made it look a lot grayer than it actually is when you see it in person or hopefully the way that you see it in these b-roll images because they are color corrected so it may or may not look exactly how it looks in person it's a much more Greener look than I expected running down the lateral side of the shoe you have that classic sply 350 stripe that sort of pixelates towards a toe and towards the heel of the shoe of course it comes in one solid black which I really like it's funny because years later after these shoes first released back in 2016 there's been no definitive answer on what sply stands for I think it stands for Supply I don't know what else it could stand for I know there's some other people who have come up with uh some other phrases but I really think it stands for Supply although it is missing a p but at this point I guess we'll never know on the medial or inside of the shoe even though the knit comes in just one color you can still notice that wavy pattern that you have on the belugas just because it's actually knit into the material that way running down the center of the shoe you have that knit detail that holds the two halves of the sneaker together is also present on the back of the shoe and then weaving over top of that through the upper of the sneaker you've got these sort of greenish gray row places around the top of the ankle opening you've got this matching piping detail and on the heel of the inside of the sneaker you've got the Adidas three stripes in this reflective material the insole of the shoe comes in a matching greenish gray color with the Yeezy and Adidas branding printed on the heel in Black And as far as internal construction for this shoe it's exactly the same as every other pair of 350 V2s now one detail I am kind of interested in is when the shoe is actually produced now if you look at size tags on a lot of different sneakers whether it's Yeezys Adidas Jordans whatever they usually feature a date on there and that's the production date so in this case it looks like the production date for this shoe was May 2022 so this shoe is produced over a year ago and that makes sense because this shoe was supposed to release at the end of last year so I'm not surprised that the shoe was made back then so it really was sitting in a warehouse for the last year because of the whole Kanye and Adidas Saga as far as sizing and fit the granite seemed to fit the same as most of the other current 350 V2s for me I usually go true to size because I like more snug fit Adidas does recommend going up at least half a size so that's something to keep in mind at this point I'm assuming that you already have pairs of 350 V2s so go with your standard size however if you don't follow Adidas's guidelines and go up half a size I think that's probably the safest bet the problem is if they don't fit you you can't return them so keep that in mind you shouldn't have too hard of a Time selling them though if they don't fit you but you might lose a couple bucks continuing down on the shoe you get to that iconic 350 V2 ripped midsole it's probably one of the last times I'm going to say that not mad about that I've probably reviewed like 60 pairs of Yeezys over the last couple of years but uh it's gonna be sad to see these guys go the material that they use on the this rubber seems to match the upper of the shoe however it is semi-translucent so you can see through to the Boost midsole underneath and then finally moving to the bottom of the shoe you've got this matching rubber on the outsole and of course you've got the cutouts to the Boost personally I think the granites are one of the cleanest 350 V2s to drop probably ever maybe that's because I love muted colors and this is definitely a muted color but I do like the fact that they went back to their roots with this shoe like it really is the same construction as an original 350 V2 so I like that I like the Callback I think that's cool and I like the Simplicity of the upper of this shoe but let me know your

H3J7yjawqHE,Nike Air Max 90,pata and Nike have had a long history of some of the most iconic sneaker collabs to release And now Pata has put his magic on the Air Max 90 It's one of the most anticipated collabs of the year And in this video I'll be telling you everything you need to know about this shoe So this is the PATA Air Max 90 Waves It will be releasing on the Panta website on June the 20th followed by a release on Nike sneakers as well as other retailers on June the 24th for a retail price of $155 or €160 There will be two colorways releasing The one I have is the cyber colorway which is this yellowish green color And there's also going to be a sapphire pair dropping which features blue accents And we have seen pictures of a third colorway dropping later this year which is this black and gum pair And there also might be this white pair dropping a white and black version No idea when that will be releasing And if you're wondering how did I manage to get these so early They did drop at one retailer here in Europe rather unexpectedly I received a notification for that drop on my sneaker Discord group and that's how I was able to check out and cop these If you are based in Europe and you're looking to cop hype sneakers or other things like laboo or Pokémon cards make sure you check out Stashed They are the number one community here in Europe and I will leave a link to join them in the description of this video So if you didn't already know Pata and Nike have had a very long history of collabing But if you're a recent sneaker head you probably know them the most from their Air Max 1 collab which they dropped in 2021 when they made one little change to the mudguard and gave Air Max fans a whole new way to appreciate the Air Max 1 And now they've taken that waves concept and applied it to the Air Max90s You get a special box with this pair It's similar to the box that the Air Max Ones came in but this time it's done in gray It features Nike and PA branding as well as the words Lobo Libby on the side which translates to love life in Surinamese The founders of PA are both originally from the South American country Surinom You get custom paper with the shoes as well which feature that classic Air Max logo that you see on the side of the Air Max 90 And looking at the shoes right away the wavy mud guard grabs your attention That signature pata detail Although it's not that noticeable on the Air Max90s Well at least not on the lateral side because you only see the wave pattern towards the front half of the shoe On the Air Max ones it feature the wave pattern throughout the mud guard all around the sneaker But at least on this pair when you switch over to the medial side you do see the wave pattern extend all the way back to the heel And to me if I'm being honest I think this side of the shoe looks cooler than this side On this cyber pair you get yellow green accents throughout the shoe especially on the midsole and also on the heel I have to admit out of the first two pairs to release I do slightly prefer that sapphire color way Although I think it would have been cool if Nike also dropped this in the iconic infrared colorway I feel like Air Max fans would have gone crazy for that On the toe box you get this gray mesh which has a more thick texture to it than a regular Air Max 90 The light gray sections of the shoe are done in leather And I'm happy that on this pair they've chosen to give it a light gray color so that you can see the contrast with the black wavy mud guard Because if you look at that upcoming black colorway you see black on black on the mud guard there and you can barely see the waves on that shoe That's why in my opinion at least the first two colorways look a lot better than that upcoming one As for the waves themselves I don't really know how to describe this material but it's kind of like a nylon material Here you can listen to it I like that this material has some shininess to it It just makes the shoes better to look at And the swoosh is done in a metallic gray color and it's also made out of a synthetic material which gives it a shiny look One of my favorite details is this lenticular logo that you see here Depending on the angle you will see either the Nike Air logo or the PA logo And that's on both the lateral and medial size And I just think that looks cool You get the Nike Air logo on the heel The tongue is done in black And it features the Pata logo as well done in that cyber color And you also get the special Pata insoles I really like the color of the laces on both of these pairs It's done in this vintage or sale color And I know that people are starting to get a bit tired of seeing vintage and sale applied to a lot of Nike models The laces match the ankle color and to me it looks great It helps the shoe differentiate a bit from your standard Air Max90s But in case you don't like these laces they also come with a pair of light gray laces as well Very quickly if this is your first time on the channel make sure you are following me on Instagram That's where I'm dropping content pretty much daily and it's the best place to reach out to me So give me a follow Throwing these on feet So a lot of you guys told me that the Air Max90s do fit very narrow for you and you go up half a size I ended up getting this pair in my true size and for me it's definitely the correct size I don't have any heel slippage I have the perfect amount of room in the toe box I would describe my feet as being slightly wide and for me it fits perfectly fine in these To give you some reference I also go with my true size in almost every other Nike model like the Air Max Ones Jordan 1's Jordan 3es And if you want to know about comfort are these shoes comfortable well yes if it was the year 1990 I mean guys come on No one is really buying classic Air Max models these days because they think they're incredibly comfy shoes Just this morning I was at the gym I was wearing my pair of Nike Vomero 5s And there is a massive difference in terms of comfort between the Vomero and this and really just most modern sneaker technology That being said though I don't find these shoes uncomfortable Wearing the IMAX90s does kind of feel like you're standing on an elevated platform and that's because the heel is more elevated on this pair than your other standard Nike shoes They're fine They're perfectly fine in terms of comfort It is not an uncomfortable shoe by any means My overall thoughts on the Pat Air Max90s I think these first two colorways are great I think it looks like a very classic pair of Air Max90s with a slight twist They're both going to look really good in the summertime I think Air Max90s personally look great with a pair of shorts I will say I do prefer the Air Max1 models over the Air Max90s Not just overall as a sneaker silhouette but even on this particular PATA collab mainly because on the Air Max ones you could see the waves very clearly all around the shoe But on this pair when you're looking at it from the lateral side yes you can notice the waves but it's not all that noticeable But still a great pair If you like Air Max90s for me these are a must Do let me know in the comments However I want to hear your thoughts What did you guys think about the Pi Air Max90 don't forget once again to follow me on Instagram Thank you so much for stopping by and for supporting my channel I will catch you guys in the next video Peace Hey hey hey,2025-06-23 11:26:29.020739 UTC

zP9386Bmv8w,PUMA Suede,puma and Pleasures are back together this time with a new take on the classic Puma suede puma and Pleasures suede Excel is inspired by The Nostalgia of the '90s and 2000 skateboard culture as you can see the sneaker features exaggerated proportion the suede Excel is knitted out with a padded tongue and padded form stripe plus Ultra wide laces invoking the overstated Aesthetics of Modern Skate culture this collaboration is definitely low profile this sneaker is all black with hints of white or cream the laces are black as well as you can see but I'm definitely going to put in some cream laces to replace the black we have SIMPLE logo hits on the tongue with the pleasures and Puma branding the Puma branding on the heel and on the side panels we have that Puma form strip and embossed in the shoe we have Puma suede XL pleasures and Puma is also all over the insole as well the Puma and Pleasures suede Excel released exclusively on the pleasures website but we did see a water release on January 6 on puma and other boutiques this sneaker did release with an affordable price tag of $120 but I got my pair on sale the Puma and pleasure suede Xcel reinvented the Puma suede the Puma suede has been loved since 1968 when it was created fast forward all the way to 2024 and the Puma sued is still a top sneaker this Puma suede goes through a fresh rebirth thanks to Pleasures if you didn't know Pleasures is a brand known for its grunge and Punky aesthetic and I think this sneaker definitely does fit that the pleasures Puma sued Excel is a mixture of the Puma Legacy and the pleasures defined ethos like I said earlier this sneaker draws inspiration from the chunky skate shoes popular in the early 2000s the pleasures pumu Excel presents a more robust design in contrast to the classic suede silhouette crafted with an all black suede upper it features accents of ivory on the Puma suede form stripe overlay cushion sock liner and the updated so we also have a much thicker tongue and premium woven fat laces that amplify its nostalgic appeal subtle branding is evident all throughout the sneaker with the pleasures logo appearing solely on the tongue tag and in sols each pair includes black laces along with an additional set in white as well this sneaker is definitely exaggerated and I don't think the average sneer consumer would really be interested in this shoe I feel like this shoe was made for people who kind of want to have a different look to their style because on feet this shoe is very very chunky when it comes to sizing I think it's safe to say that you can go a full size up and the pleasures p a suede XL normally I'm a size 12 but I got this sneaker in a size 13 and it fits perfectly meaning that this shoe runs a full size small so if you're getting this shoe be sure to go a full size up and you'll have no problem when it comes to comfortability you should know that this shoe is not any more comfortable than the average Puma sued meaning that if you want to wear this shoe for a long periods of time I would definitely do a sole swap the insole in the sneaker is very very thin but you can go ahead and just buy a thicker one that's more comfortable that's for everyday wear or for athletic use and you'll have no problem there is a little bit of cushioning in this so of the sneaker but I think just to be safe I would do inso swap when it comes to Quality and craft and I'm taking a look at my shoe now and I don't really have any issues or flaws besides the little bit of loose threading that's just left on the shoe from the factory I barely have any glue stains to be honest with you and the suede on this shoe as if with any Puma suede just well done and for that reason I would have to give this shoe a n out of 10 I really do hope haa and Pleasures team up again for another colorway of this shoe because this was the only color that dropped afterwards haa did release a bunch of gr colorways of this shoe so I think the collaboration with Pleasures was just to introduced this new shoe model and they have no other plans to do any more collab but I could be wrong and hopefully I'm wrong so as you're watching this video You Must Be Wondering to yourself is the pleasures pom Excel worth it and I would say yes 100 times yes this is a classic sneaker reinvented to fit a 2024 style if you think you can pull these sneakers off I definitely recommend getting a pair and doing a lace Swap and putting in the white laces the sneaker is a bit exaggerated so they would look best with baggy pants as well and because they're a little bit chunkier than your average sneaker they may be a tad bit heavy in hand but on feet they'll barely notice so once again I definitely do think these sneakers are worth it and if you want a pair get your hands on a pair before the prices increase I got my pair for $76 on Stadium Goods while the retail price was $12 bucks I knew if I waited out a little bit I would be able to get these sneakers for the low on the aftermarket because I don't think people early after these the on feet is up next but thank you for watching this quick review on the pleasures Puma suede XL if you want to see more sneaky reviews please be sure to like share comment and subscribe it goes a long way for me and it's a small step for you thank you for watching I'll see you in the next one

btaeAC5M2sA,Onitsuka Mexico 66,shoes are a big part of my life I wouldn't consider myself a sneaker head but there's nothing quite like getting a new pair of shoes the anticipation as you open the box the smell of a fresh pair of sneakers and the feeling of putting them on for the first time no matter where you're from everyone appreciates a good pair of Footwear which is where these classic shoes come into play this is a story of how watching movies drew me closer to these iconic sneakers what's up guys welcome back to Jay on film I'm Jay and this is my life on film but first let me bring it back a bit lately I've been hit with an immense wave of boredom I guess it's because of the fact that I've just finished the second last semester of my University degree but I just haven't had anything to do I've had no motivation and you could even say I'm feeling a little burnt out so to overcome this boredom I recently decided to stimulate my creativity by watching movies in saying that I didn't want to just keep my eyes glued to a screen without gaining anything from it so I challenged myself to pay attention to the smaller details like shot compositions and storytelling techniques why well so I can improve my own film making and so it began in these last few weeks I've watched a bunch of different movies in series dramas Thrillers romcoms and action movies I watched them all all of these brought me different kinds of inspiration but I wanted a bit more so I looked towards famous film directors and among the many films that I watched I realized a lot of them were directed by this man right here Quinton Tarantino now I'm not a big fan of the violence but Tarantino is a master at both storytelling and embedding cultural references in his work I'm sure you're familiar with the name but if you aren't Tarantino directed many classic films such as Jango and chained Pulp Fiction and Kill Bill even though I was trying to focus on the references film techniques and subtle details my attention was drawn in by something else the only took a tiger Mexico 66 hey now I've been wanting a pair of these for a while now and while I was in Japan I even searched far and wide to find a pair in my size but that ended in Failure so when I saw these iconic sneakers and Kill Bill I was drawn in once again and that's when I became fixated I became obsessed I kept searching for reviews I mentioned them to my friends and family I literally could not stop thinking about them and that's when my mom called me hello hey buddy I've got a surprise for you downstairs enjoy by oh yeah these are fire when I wake up early in the morning and when I come home at night everything is covered in darkness and the Sun is all right let's talk about the shoes for a bit the only tiger Mexico 66s are a classic sneaker that was designed to be Ona's flagship shoe released in 1966 the shoes were originally developed for running as the 1968 Olympics held in Mexico were right around the corner the Mexico 66s then Rose in popularity due to the success of Japanese athletes who wore the brand during the game as time passed the Mexico 66s became an iconic silhouette due to its appearances in different films and forms of media which it to make its way into the mainstream market in Game of Death Bruce Lee wore a yellow and black pair to match with his jumpsuit and Tarantino paid homage to this through Kill Bill volume 1 this elevated its status in both pop culture and fashion because of these noticeable appearances the Mexico 66s have become one of onuka Tiger's most successful shoes to date as for me I admire versatility and these shoes embody that it doesn't matter what type of bottoms I'm wearing the Mexico 66s will complement them perfectly now although it's not as iconic as the black and yellow pair I specifically chose this white colorway because it fits well with my current style and more specifically its relationship with denim denim is my favorite material in clothing and 90% of the time I'm wearing denim bottoms to any occasion the way that these shoes synergize with jeans is a perfect match for my wardrobe and even though they lacked a bit of screen time this colorway actually appeared in Kill Bill as well let's break these down a bit the shoes were designed for practicality which makes it an ideal shoe for the urban lifestyle Comfort 10 out of 10 like I mentioned before the Mexico 66s are fit for any occasion versatility 10 out of 10 the shoes are true to size and hug your feet perfectly they don't constrict Mobility at all and they're one of the lightest pairs of sneakers I've ever owned fit 10 10 out of 10 now for the price point I'd say they're okay cost 7 out of 10 but the most important question to ask when buying a shoe is can I wear these out when I have absolutely nothing else to wear the answer 100% yes so if you want a shoe that boasts a classic low cut silhouette the Mexico 66s are the perfect shoe for you I think the most appealing thing about these shoes is the culture behind them the Mexico 66s are a shoe that was refined over time and grew in popularity in both Sports and fashion because they're so practical it only makes sense that I wanted to pick them up and it's a little early but with spring coming up I genuinely believe that the only two k tiger Mexico 66s will be my go-to sneaker for the season you better stop moving and feel the music get your Grove on and let it use you when you feel the fire and you know it's right pure desire Just Hold On Tight get up down move around get down on the ground get high and touch the sky you know the reasons why Just Dance come on Just Dance Just Dance come on Just Dance when the heat gets too hard to handle and you know you're about to get it and you can reach much higher now you better believe it you can look at the clouds fly by come on and let yourself enjoy the ride and fly a little higher all right y'all that's the end of the story shout

45kpKPcixfw,Air Jordan 1,smells like leather that's awesome and moth balls No never they were found in the back of a warehouse somewhere there has to be moth ball smell like mold not moth balls hey what's good guys my name is Chris welcome back to the official wear testers.com YouTube channel today we got a detailed look and review on these guys right here are they bad boys not my pair but this is the Air Jordan one on sneakers they're calling them Chicagos even though they've been using the promotion and everything to say lost and found so what is their name but anyways this shoe is one of my favorite shoes of all time like the air Jord one is just awesome the Chicago colorway is my favorite colorway of the shoe I think that these are really really cool kind of like overall I think that the overall presentation and packaging is pretty much fantastic like this is like none some of the best storytelling that they've done even though I don't completely agree with the story that they are telling but you know you got a mismatch lid here because these are supposed to be shoes that they just found in the back room which still happens to this day there's so much shoes especially it happens probably more today than it does back in the day but anyways you go into the back room and you're just like oh I found a random pair of whatever this is yoink so that's what the whole concept of the shoe is I do think that it's awesome because I've been in stores like this like where like there's like the main store and then you go to the back and there's other stuff and it's like a time capsule it's amazing but inside the Box they come double wrapped you've got two types of paper one's the regular plain paper the other one is really really cool it's got a ton of original ads from the80s for the Air Jordan 1 it's really dope though to see like how cheap they got you know what I mean like this was not an easy sell back in the80s shoes didn't look like this this was one of the first ones to truly bring like crazy colors outside of the dunks and things like that to be true to your school stuff so it was one of the first ones to really like be wild like that on top of that it was a signature shoe the guy hadn't even played a game in the NBA wow they signed him to a signature deal gave him a signature shoe before he even played in the leag everybody was like why am I going to buy this guy's shoe so it wasn't an easy sale they had to really play up on these mom and pop shops and really sell the shoes to them which is the part of the story that I dislike sorry what was that turn the phones off lady I know I'm sorry I was going to chime in with something but I wanted to verify was it a in life meme no it's about how you're saying how hard a sell this shoe is and I follow a lot of mommy bloggers and this one her daughter just had her I don't know if it's a bar mitzvah or a bat mitzvah anyways she posted pictures from the party and every single kid in these photos was what year was this like last weekend oh okay I thought was you're going to be like it was from the ' 80s no but every kid in this at this party is wearing Jordan ones to match whatever fancy outfit and I'm like there wasn't a single van not a single Converse they were just all Jordan Ones yeah that's cuz of Our Generation we made this Beast oops sorry something that I find very interesting though again like I was saying the story of the whole thing is like they come with this fake receipt and stuff the Sandy Bros it's not a real shop but it's really cool there's tons of Easter eggs in this thing by the way so if you can list them all do it I'm only going to give you one that guy right there is wearing a pair of airships that's sick I do like that the receipt it reminds me of like growing up and oh dude like the way that you used to like do a credit card with the like I said the packaging presentation everything amazing they'd never done it better than this it just sucks that the story that they're telling talking about Mom and Pop shops and stuff like this is the same brand that has killed many M and pop shops because they're trying to go direct to Consumer whereas back in the'80s they had to really sell this product to a mom and pop shop and be like no trust me this is going to sell like this is going to be a hot item this is going to be this this is our best thing whatever I was just in one of those meetings I've never been in a buyer meeting before where a brand is pitching to retailers like why you want to carry their product it was one of the most fascinating things I've ever been in you know what I mean I had no like say in anything cuz it wasn't my deal or whatever but like I was just kind of like a fly on the wall I was in the back of the room it was super interesting and that's what Nike had to do back then they had to be be like no trust us you're going to want to carry this product people are going to want it from this guy and so without these mom and pop shops taking a chance on this brand and on this model right here Nike wouldn't be where it is today you know what I mean like it's just it is a fact and then they've pulled their accounts from multiple mom and pop shops some of them The Originals that they used to sell to it's up that this is like what they're celebrating when they've literally killed fam's businesses Once Upon a Time Nike was like Scrub Daddy is that what this spch is called on Shark Tank oh yeah yeah yes that's that's exactly what it's like like it was such an interesting thing to be part of like in that buyer meeting I'm not going to say what brand it is it was a smaller brand because that's not how Nike operates now I've been part of those meetings as well again fly in the room like just in the back and Nike and Jordan tell you what you're going to get they don't even let you pick it half the damn time it's wild and then they give you all the other crap that doesn't sell just to carry this one they're like oh if you want to carry this you've got to buy all of these from us and it's just the way that the power structure has worked is completely flipped on itself that's the part that I don't really like this is the part that I don't hear anybody talking about which is unfortunate but I mean most people are new let's be real and these shoes are amazing oh the shoes the shoes themselves are gorgeous like look at this this left this left pair is so good this right one is leaning so hard like this toe box is so crooked can you see it it's perfect it's literally been like giving me some kind of Elvis look bro I get these in cuz there's two problems here there's a manufacturing issue right so that's a Jordan brand problem but then there's also this whole like goat verified checklist quality control is a whole section like you're telling me that this passed really and I'm not a fan of resellers but I'm going to be on your side for this time because I know damn well if you had this shoe and you're trying to sell it on that platform they're going to take it in and they're going to reject it from you they're not going to let you sell it because it looked like and if you do they're going to be like no you got to note that there are defects but if it's goat selling it directly to you cuz I bought the instant ship pair prever verified which means that it's part of their stock they don't give a their rules don't apply to them I think that's up there was somebody who commented on I think yesterday's video the Jordan 2os and he was saying that he tried to sell something on Goat I can't remember what Jordan it was but because it looked like there was Heavy creasing in the toe that's not even a defect that's just leather and but he he was adamant that he had never warn them oh no that's the thing though I've seen that stockx does it too these companies are shady as so yeah there's all kinds of that problems in the world obviously these are first world problems like there's much worse things going on all across the globe right now but we're here to talk about shoes so that's exactly what I'm doing now as far as the shoe itself is concerned Everybody Knows by now what this is this is an Air Jordan one it's part of the new batch or the new shape we saw this previously with those uh Gorge greens it's supposed to be kind of in that same line and everything so we've got slightly different different outsole this one is vintaged which I think is funny because when they tried this the first time man it was almost a decade ago and it was with the first retro release of the AJ K's the canvas ones people fing hated it hated it and now everybody's like yeah it's prev vintage this is awesome I'm like wow this is so weird the soul is slightly yellow that's not too bad so this I can deal with you know what I mean when it's like weirdly piss yellow like the vibe remake lab shoe which bar none is still one of the best Jordans I've ever like just seen and a guy like crafts the shoe by hand with love and care but the SS is gross I don't like that I don't mind when they do that on their own I just don't want to buy it like that and then the materials themselves like I was saying earlier man these smell like leather they don't smell like glue it smells like quality so there's not a lot of bad things here it's just this is one of those be careful pick your pairs you know what I mean like if you're able to look at them in store just do it obviously I got these online I can't do that like you get what you get now the tech specs are just as you guys know they feature the greatest traction of all time in inside the rubber cupsole is a polyurethane wedge inside of the polyurethane wedge is a heel air unit one thing that I was a little disappointed by besides the right shoe is that uh the insole is the black polyurethane I thought it was going to be a white one cuz it's like an OG OG you know what I mean but I guess they're going to save that for the 85 cut version whenever they release that next awesome wow a lot of people don't like the crack leather I am one of those people the white portions don't bother me as much cuz I can't really see it like it's very very fine uh this one is a little bit more distressed than the other one one uh this is going to be one of those things where it's just kind of I don't want to call it inconsistent just because they're cracks like they are inconsistent by Nature you know what I mean like they're not going to be able to do that like perfectly every time I don't really like the back part though that just looks weird it looks dirty or unfinished it's supposed to be a nod to when you do find them in the back they're not perfect I thought the originals was like a painted sponge uh some of them are some of them are not there's so many different factories that they manufactured the original Air Jordan 1 in that like they're all a little different so if you see or hear or talk to an OG OG like somebody that was like a teen to an adult back then they'll straight up specify what Factory do you have and like you'll have to like know what it is and they are marked in there and all that stuff they still are now they're on the size labels but yeah it's just one of those weird things where they were all made a little bit differently that's why when they did the whole 85 cut I was like these kind of look more like a 94 and not like an 85 like it looks like more like a mix you know what I mean like almost like a hybrid so yeah that's why I think the vibe remake lab shoe is so interesting cuz that guy was meticulous about making the every panel the shape the back structure everything like all of it was on point something that I love though is just when you pull them out of the box this is what they look like and I found some original pictures from I'm going to try to Source the right person cuz online everybody steals pictures so I don't know exactly where everything originates from I did my best to try to like Source it it'll be on there but this is how they looked you pulled them out of the box they came with two sets of laces they were pre-placed in there and stuff and I think it's really really dope but anyways these guys have the slightly bigger swoosh they also have the 85 style wings logo on there so if you were to match this up with a regular air Jord one highog and the 85 version the highog has the Pressed what the is that called OSS deboss I don't remember I'm sorry you guys teach me every time and somehow it just keeps going right through but anyways this one's more like the 85 cut where it kind of comes off the shoe and everything like that which I think is dope the tongue is awesome it's nylon it's got the yellow like it looks yellow but it's actually just a padding underneath so I think that that's really really cool the overall shape it's not perfect it's not quite like an 85 but it's better than they have been so I like this a lot you can tell that they're fine-tuning things as they go along which I appreciate I just don't appreciate that one like that one's just a lot of people are like oh the SS are uneven but when you put your weight on it it flattens out that's true I have tons of ones a lot of them are like this and when I wear them they do flatten out but the toe is also crooked and it makes me feel like it's forcing my foot to have a bunion and that doesn't feel good it's not comfortable it's not what I paid for this thing looked like The Simpsons character's eyes where one's like straight and the other one's that way nah don't look at me but you're everywhere it's not cool overall though I think that the concept the packaging obviously the color the shoe itself just legendary like there's nothing else to say other than there's a craftsmanship or quality flaw there I hope that a lot of pairs are not like this these are going to be like super mass-produced so check your pairs man like there's going to be more like this than not it just is what it is now as far as their size is concerned they do fit true to size whatever you typically wear in your air Jord 1es that's exactly what I would recommend here I again think that these are great at least this left one this right one needs some work though man but with all that being said thank you so much for watching thanks for all your support we greatly appreciate it and with that being said we'll catch you on the next one so until next time have a good one,2025-06-19 08:40:13.608130 UTC
Wwh1F2sei_Y,Adidas Samba,"so I pulled you guys on Twitter the other week and asked which is the better pair the Sambas or Gazels from Adidas And like there was an overwhelming like 75% that said the Sambas were the better shoe but I did actually have a pair here and I never showed you guys these So I wanted to show you guys a pair that I got Um shout out to Adidas for sponsoring the content over here And they did send me this pair by request cuz I actually again I've I've had these for months and I haven't done a video on these but I've it's been by intent I just haven't got around to it Anyway we have it here And this is the Sambas that I did get And they're different than the standard pair as you could see here So sambas typically are $100 from uh Adidas I'll link them in the description if you guys are interested to head over to Adidas website They literally have 20 plus colorways of sambas Like an insane insane insane amount I would say the cloud white core black gum colorway is by far just the most standard and the best one The one that I see literally everybody wearing males females it's the one Uh but I wanted to kind of branch out and and see what these other ones were So the one that I got is the Samba OG in this brown brown gum colorway And this is a premium pair that cost $140 instead of the the typical $100 The leather quality looks definitely elevated comparison You have a leather liner in here as well And these came with blue laces also So I wanted to lace one with each Honestly the brown laces I think look better The blue adds a little bit of pop but honestly I don't think it needs it I like the brown color they shoe with the brown gumsole As a description on their website 4.7 stars out of five with 1500 reviews is nuts Uh it says ""A dressy monochrome take on a classic samba with elegant brogue details I don't even know what brogue means Whether kicking it on the streets or stepping out in the evening these Adidas samba OG shoes deliver iconic style with a touch of sophistication Its legacy of indoor training shoes turn streetear icon continues to grow Crafted from premium leathers these shoes give a classic silhouette and elegant dressy look The smooth leather upper rubber outsole and leather lining provide durability and comfort for all day wear These shoes embody the lifestyle of creativity and individuality uh that Adidas Originals is known for Now unfortunately this colorway and the lighter color way is only available in lower sizes now But I mean that's the thing about the Adidas sambas like you look at their website and it's like yeah they they don't sell out They have a thousand of them but they have so many colorways that sell out and then they have a bunch of them that just have a couple odd sizes and then you have a couple of them that are available in all sizes So it's definitely one of those like shoes that they have a lot of offerings for and I like that they have them kind of evergreen Nike has their Air Force One white on whites It's always in stock The Sambas and the Gazels both I feel like are staples uh from the Adidas front that have been there for a while and a lot of people really enjoy what they're offering And I like this box too with the Adidas box It looks like it has little ventilation holes on the sides as well Um kind of a nice little feature Got to let the leather breathe So if you want a little history on the Adidas Samba this shoe was originally created in 1949 And it actually did feature the gumsole originally Um so football players can train on icy and hard grounds Now they literally have like 10 different versions of sambas The samba OGs are the ones that I focus on though here and they're usually made of a mix of suede and leathers I'm sure you've seen sambas on a bazillion different movies and they've also had like a thousand different collaborations with the samba including ones with Jonah Hill Atmos Disney Fel Human Race Sporty and Rich Sean Witherspoon Kith and so on So the sticking power and the selling power of the SA has proven to be something that we've seen a lot of and I think that especially in 2025 the lower profile sleeker look is still like the trend For summertime I feel like it's going to be the Sambas again based on all the replies that you guys were saying as well This color way though is a little bit different You could see obviously with the way that this shoe is put together it looks more like a dress shoe than a casual shoe And I kind of liked it Uh the fact that it has the all leather upper first of all instead of the the leather and suedes but you actually have extra little details in the leather extra stitching as well and then that jagged kind of tooth like finish on all of the panels I just thought it looked really cool Again it just reminds me kind of a nice pair of dress shoes So definitely a different vibe than a standard pair I do like the gums sole on the bottom as well And overall how do the Sambas fit for me they fit true to size but um they are a little bit narrow I I am a little bit of a wider foot in general so like I don't necessarily love shoes that are super narrow which is why I kind of stayed away from sambas and gazels primarily I mean I've covered on this channel a bazillion different pairs of Adidas shoes primarily Adidas Boost like the Ultra Boost just cuz I love the comfort side of things But there's a functionality to the Sambas and the Gazels And even though they have like a firmer midsole and stuff people prefer that sometimes over like a cushioned midsole It's just overall something that has more ground feel and just more standard traditional sort of feel overall And I feel like that's probably the reason why people come back to them over and over again But anyways have you guys tried a pair of sambas yet in 2025 are you guys more of a team gazelle uh or the superstars i like to see a nice resurgence in those as well I've seen a couple different colorways including the Bape colorway I almost bought those I really wanted to get them I should have bought a pair of them because the Bape one actually has the Bape Star on the side and on the superstar It's like a a play on a words I thought that was a really clever collab as well But Adidas is sneaky man They're coming up with some cool things And you know I've been reviewing Adidas for a long time and I haven't really reviewed SAS before So it's fun to be able to get a pair and show you guys them Shout out to Adidas for sending them over But I hope you guys have a good rest of the day Again if you guys want to buy a pair of Sombas link in the description It will take you to Adidas and you can shop through and and just see all of the different uh versions that they have cuz they have a ton of them It's definitely worth a look if you haven't been to their site and seen what they have available in a while But have a good one Hopefully see you back on the channel for some more sneaker content uh very soon All right",2025-06-19 08:41:00.832664 UTC
PJpQUovs890,New balance 550,so a few months ago we cut apart the new balance 550s and I love these shoes I love everything about them except for one very important thing the leather quality is probably the worst leather we've seen on any of the big Brands sneakers which is a bummer because I really liked everything about this shoe so as soon as that video posted everyone's like hey what you're looking for is the ALDS because allegedly they're better quality they have better leather they have a little bit better colorways with the kind of the creamy off-white colors and so we got a pair to cut them in half and really we're going to look for two things what's the difference between the ALDS when it comes to the quality of materials compared to the regulars and we're also going to look at what the difference is between the 650s and 550s generally and see how many parts overlap and if there's any differences that you need to know when you're considering buying a 550 a 650 or a regular in the ald that's the whole concept of the video and thanks to stockx for sponsoring this video and if you don't know who stockx is I'm surprised that you're watching this channel but if you don't know stock is a live Global marketplace where you can find basically everything from retro Jordan's Nike's easy gaming consoles tons of Legos collectible artwork trading cards basically anything that's hard to find stockx has it and the best thing about stockx and I'm not even saying this just because it's an ad is they have a Below Retail section so not only can you find hard to find things but you can get those hard to find things for a very affordable price because they have a whole section devoted to to Below Retail and so sometimes on these these shoe videos that we do like with the Balenciaga I said 825 the entire video instead of 950 or 9.95 because that's what we got them for on stockx so we didn't even spend 950 bucks we we spent a hundred dollars less which compared to a thousand dollar shoe isn't a whole lot of savings but a hundred bucks for my small company being able to save that with the Below Retail section is a huge bonus and stockx's product catalog is constantly growing you know they they might have started off with Sneakers but now they have basically everything and the vast majority of this the hard to find sneaker is the retro sneakers that we do we cut apart on this channel come from stockx because they have such a huge catalog so if you're on the hunt for those hard to find sneakers or boots or Legos or anything collectible check out stockx first because a lot of times you can get them for that below retail price and they have so many things that are hard to find so thanks again to stockx for sponsors video and check them out the link in my description so usually we go over the history at this segment but we covered it pretty well in the 550 video but one thing that's worth noting is some people think that the 550 was the original one that was released in 1989 when all reality it was a 650 and later the 550 was a cut down low top version of the 650 that's why they call it the 550. so now start going over some of the details and if you haven't seen the 550 video go check that out it's pretty interesting and it has more of the history but the big issue I had with the 550s was that it was cut from that split portion of the Hide which is usually turned into Suede and then was covered up with a really heavy plastic coating to make it look like it was a higher quality leather which is pretty common in sneaker you know Nike's really famous for doing that by putting a really heavy plastic coating on top to make the leather look more even and consistent because they're selling thousands and thousands of shoes and for this type of product they liked it to be consistent but it also allows them to hide some of the cheaper materials and some of the flaws and that's exactly what the New Balance 550 did whereas it's not doesn't have any of that grain pattern at the top that most people associate with that smooth texture of leather it's just from that really fibrous like suede portion and so to see if the 650s were also cut from that split portion we cut a little slit in it and put the macro lens on it to see if we could see any grain and surprisingly there was some grain in there so right off the bat the 650s already have a better leather because like I said the 550s are probably the worst leather I've seen in a name brand Big Brand sneaker so what about the thickness so we took a measurement of the 550s and once again on the thinner side for sneakers I was right at one millimeter but the ald 650s were at 1.5 millimeter so close closer to what we see with Nikes and a lot of the other popular sneakers so once again leg up on the 650s and then as for the top coat we put the macro lens on it and the 550s have that fake print embossed into the plastic coating so we put it on the ALDS and it still has that fake print it looks like it has a plastic coating so we've we got the lighter out and on the 550s when we burn the 550s it just bubbled and sizzled and just like that top plastic coating just melted away and we're able to scrape it off and basically the same thing happened to the 650s where maybe it doesn't quite have quite as much of a heavy layer but it's still a really heavy plastic coating that bubbled up that you could scrape off so when it comes to the longevity of this leather not even necessarily from a durability standpoint but but for how long it's going to look good because this the ALDS have that grain pattern in it it does make them potentially last longer but because both of these are coated with a really heavy plastic coating they're both going to look about the same it's just a little bit better leather quality but when it comes to actually grading these Leathers we graded the 550s at a d but because the ALDS have a little bit of the grain I'd probably bump it up to a c but in all reality you're not going to get that much more durability and longevity out of or even like General appearance out of these two shoes because they're both just topped with a plastic coating but at least it is slightly better and when it comes to considering a pair I would way rather have them more durable ald leather that has that grain pattern in it it doesn't quite have that same inconsistent even texture from that split portion underneath that's coated by the plastic Leather So ALDS better leather even if it is just a little bit better and then if we move to the inside of the shoe they both have basically the exact same insole you know they're just different colors because of different colorways whereas top with the fabric and it has two different layers of foam with the little arch support same thing and then if you look at the lining exact same material in the lining as well so it seems like a lot of the components are shared across the 550 to the 650 and from the regulars to the ald these especially the synthetic components because if you look even closer on the inside you'll see that there's that same fiberboard lasting board that we saw in the 550s and this was something I really liked about the 550s because the way the shoe is built is not the same way that most shoes are built where that upper stops where the stroble Stitch begins that's trouble stitching that lasting material to the upper this upper wraps all the way underneath and is tucked underneath the lasting board and the lasting board it's a lot harder it's a lot thicker and it's a lot more uh stable underfoot than most of the lasting materials you see in sneakers that's just basically a thin layer of some sort of fabric and both have the pros and cons you know that like the lasting fabric materials that are a lot more flexible they have a lot more twist in them so they're a lot more natural feeling underfoot but the lasting boards like this fiber board it offers you a lot more stable platform it gives you a little bit more rigidity it breaks into the shape of your foot a little bit more so you get a little more custom fit so if you like the feel of more of a boot underfoot rather than a sneaker that's part of why I really like this shoes because it's it's almost like a boot sneaker and then if we look at the outsole exact same outsole same pattern obviously just different colors and we'll see when we get it cut in half if they're the same thicknesses that's another thing I really liked about the 550s it was the thickest rubber we'd seen in basically any sneaker that's a name brand sneaker and we also ran a durometer test on the outsoles to see if they're the same rubber compound they both came in at about 75 short a which tells me that they're probably the exact same outsole just different colors and then finally to the last thing we're going to talk about is the construct production so both of these are cemented construction that are board lasted and also have that sidewall Stitch that has that unique little window right here that where you can see the actual foam midsole in here and obviously the sidewall stitching stops there and somebody in the comment section of the 550 video mentioned that that was originally designed to allow that foam to have a an area to expand out into so you have a little bit more squish underfoot that sounds like very like 30 30 year old technology jargon which I'm assuming it is I don't really think you're going to get a whole lot more squished from just having this little window but more than anything it's just cool to be able to see like the midsole and it also adds some really unique angles and texture to the shoe so if you just look at the difference between this outside where it's just a regular capsule and how much more interesting the inside is it's kind of like that like 80s transformery angly like mechanical look to it I also love the styling of the shoe so far just from the outside they're basically identical except for the leather quality and the leather on the 650s is slightly better because it has that gray and that would that was the biggest gripe I had with the 550s as all these components are so thick and so um robust but they use the absolute worst leather so at least in the 650s from what we can tell it has average sneaker quality leather that's only half the story because we haven't cut them in half to see what's on the inside so let's chop them up and see if there's any differences between these on the inside foreign foreign we got them cut in half so let's see what's inside so I've got the cross section of the 550 and now the 650 ALDS and they're basically identical on the inside now you can see that fiberboard is the exact same around the same thickness and even that outsole it's really really thick and basically twice as thick as any of the Nikes we've cut apart still just as thick and the 650 ALDS and now we can see that it is board lasted where that upper is wrapped underneath and locked in place with that lasting board which is more like a boot style of construction which I like and everything else is exactly the same except for the foam on the inside of the 650s it's just a little bit taller you know in the 650s it's 13.6 millimeters tall at the hill and 6.25 millimeters at the toe versus the 550s are 12 and 4.8 so just a slight difference and that once again might just be a margin of error from the factory or the different models and we also tested the durometer of these Foams and they came in at 40 Shore a so exact same foam densities and squishiness and now what's the difference between the ALDS and the 550s well it really comes down to two things the first thing is those those more creamy colorways the off-white colorways and the second thing is the leather quality the ALDS do have just a slightly better leather it's a little bit thicker at 1.5 millimeters versus one millimeter it has a little bit of that grain which is going to give it a little more durability it'll give the texture a little bit more of an even finish it might crease a little bit less and you'll know that you're at least buying Nike and every other Brand's standard quality of leather in the ALDS so are the regular 550s and 650s worth it with that slightly inferior leather well I really love these shoes because they're really stable underneath your foot you have that board lasted technique that might give you a little bit more durability and breaks into the shape of your foot I love that thick outsole and I really really like that like 80s like Transformers retro design of them so to me just from all that I wouldn't mind having a pair it wouldn't dissuade me for 110-ish dollar first to buy a pair of these if they're 200 bucks I probably wouldn't but because these are priced where they're at I still feel like they're worth it for the other advantages but when it comes to the ALDS is it worth spending an extra 40 to 50 dollars to get the slightly better leather it depends on what you value they probably last around the same amount but a lot of people are buying the ALDS not because it's slightly better leather but because of how they look so if that's what you value they might be worth it because they really do look better in my opinion and for me it'd be like a really big leather nerd I just would rather have this leather and spend the extra 40 or 50 bucks to get the ALDS so for me personally they're worth it from an objective standpoint I still think they're worth it because this leather is just standard quality leather and there's a lot of sneakers out there in that 150 to 160 price range that are built worse than this that most people buy on a regular basis so I still think they're worth it even if you compare it to the regular pairs that are significantly less money so the the overall takeaway of this video is 650s versus 550s they're built from basically the same components in the same way so whether it's ald or the regular pairs not much difference between them turns out everyone was right in the comment sections and the DMS that were letting us know that ALDS are better leather but it's still not great leather at the end of the day and I was hoping for maybe a b or even a grade leather out of the ALDS so maybe in the future they'll come out with some better Leathers but even still I still love these shoes and you are getting slightly better leather in the ALDS so let me know what you guys think and what your experience has been with these different shoes and if you've had the two how they've compared and contrasted and let me know what other sneakers you want us to cut apart because this was really interesting to me because we're always on the pursuit to find the best version of whatever iconic sneakers out there so let me know and thanks so much for everything you guys do see ya thank you,2025-06-23 14:50:48.674409 UTC
3u6lBxNbxuw,New balance 550,so apparently everyone thinks this is the most comfortable New Balance model well I'm about to see if that's true so these are the new balance 960s in the green and white colorway retails 150 probably the biggest design detail is how wide that out soole is I'm really liking the tone of green that they picked for this model and the design of the inside of the New Balance logo is super cool all right here's my genuine first reaction to trying on the 960 I'm not going to lie they're really comfortable it's tough to say that definitively they are the most comfortable but they're definitely in the running to be one thing that I'm not a huge fan of is how big that back heel is I'm definitely going to be wearing these some more,2025-06-23 14:50:47.852738 UTC
AJktvk4Y3Z0,Vans Old Skool,so hello you beautiful people my name is zach downey today we're talking about the vans classic updated shoe but before we get into all of that the details of the shoes i've been skiing them for about two months now so definitely put them through a little bit of an r d and some uh you know have some feedback on them but before we get into that i'm super hyped because i got a package in the mail today from adored skateboards that is core duffel's new board company and inside is an 8.5 so before we jump into the vans and how they've been holding up for the course of two months let's uh let's open this new board got the personal touch to you i you know i really admire and love that that's why you support the you know companies that you really like that's the skateboarders that you like the brands that you really like so shout out to corey duffel for starting his new endeavor adored skateboards now the debate is if i want to hang this or put it on my wall i think this will be really good in my office i've been trying to up my decor game in the office so maybe you guys can be the decider let's go let's go see where i would put it so as you can see i have one board on this wall over here on the left side chris lurk billboard one of the homies now the duffel board might go on the other side that's where i was thinking work because it's kind of you know symmetrical trying to up the game like i said in my office it's a pretty small space but uh i might do like a little tour of the house and upgrades because i bought our house about two years ago and pretty much changed everything so let me know as well if that's something you want to see but let's let's jump into the details of these vans and how they've been treating me all right so let's talk about these vans and what i think so far and there's supposed to be a whole updated shoe i'm not going to go too much into like the whole marketing everything that they pushed i actually did do an initial review right when i got these shoes i'll leave a link down below if you want to check that video out i did a lot more skating this is kind of more of like my thoughts after a lot of skating that was kind of like my initial thoughts and i think my review has changed shifted to be honest what i loved about these shoes right away is that they were really easy to break in and i'll get into like the caveat to that and i guess we'll just talk from like the bottom of the shoe and go up we'll just go from there so they said that the um you know the waffle grip their famous vans waffle grip is supposed to be like 50 stronger or something there's some more marking around that and like i think it is deeper that's what it seems like it seems like it is deeper i wouldn't say it's grippier or i don't know more durable i don't think that's the right word to use it feels like there's just more of the fabric so like maybe it'll last longer if you're dragging your heel a lot if you're filming or if you're just bombing hills that'll definitely work to your advantage it feels like they're just more sold but it doesn't feel like it's stronger or i guess like different technology it just feels like it's more material if anything then as you go up i really didn't rip anything too you know too fast like i started ripping some of the sides some of the you know the wave logo started ripping and i did get some sort of just minor damage on this side kickflip spot but i'm not doing a lot of flip tricks to be honest like i don't know i'm just not flipping my tricks like the average skateboarder is but as you can see this came up pretty quick so like i was saying a second ago i broke them in really quick that was nice i was able to ski them right out of the box and like i didn't have that like stiff shoe feeling which i do um appreciate i don't really like the stiff shoe feeling but the caveat to that is that they got floppy really quick like within two weeks they were kind of very like not a structure not as strong and i try to like really preserve them too i didn't like skate them right off the bat i ended up like just kind of working them a little bit trying to use them as like a nicer shoe and then slowly skated them and then as soon as i started skating them they really did just lose their structure fairly quick but that's not to say they didn't hold up because they have held up really good the difference on these shoes i paid like about 65 dollars so i don't think there were much more than the classics maybe 10 to 20 depending if you're shopping online or your local skate shop but um if we're gonna say overall i would not buy these for the more expensive price now that i've skied them i don't think they're really worth it i didn't feel like i got more out of the buck per se i think they're just as good as the other shoes there might have been a little more durability in the in the sole but overall on the top everything else it's it's the same shoe practically the one thing i do like about it is it has these straps in the tongue and the tongue did stay up you know in betw in between under your laces a lot better where some of the classics the tongue does kind of like fall to the side that's just like an annoying thing but i don't think it was really like of a performance thing somebody mentioned like the vans are about a 10 upgrade like this specific uh upgraded models like a ten percent migrate from the original shoe which i think is a fair a very fair review because i think also you don't want a super super you know a different shoe people are so used to what they have already bought and skated by vans advanced consumers so obviously they didn't want to change it too much because that would have thrown people off that is definitely a fair thing to mention as well but you know vans are a pretty good shoe overall i wouldn't buy this model again i'll definitely be buying some vans again i'll probably just stick to the classics or maybe half cab something like that i saw some america's recently i really want to try and some last resorts that i want to try as well but they're not totally done like even after two months i can still keep skating these the stitching is falling apart it's losing its structure so the bad part about that is that like even though it's held up through flip tricks and the outside cosmetics have held pretty good like the shoelaces are still even intact like there's some wire tear clearly but they're still intact the thing about it is they're just running out of big bowls has um you know has their repercussions has this impact has its uh abuse to your feet if you will so like constantly diving your toes uh into the front of your shoe when you're running out of big transition does take its toll and if you don't have a shoe that's very structured over time that can be kind of just strain you as you end up like almost rolling your toes a lot more so i think i'll definitely get some more skate sessions out of these shoes but yeah i'm excited to try some maybe those last resorts or americas or let me know down below what other like skate shoe companies do you think i should try out because i'm always trying different shoes i'm not really stuck on one pair in specific right now there's definitely shoes i can say are my goat chains i i know i'm gonna love them but i like mixing it up just for the factor of like changing the style and uh the cosmetics of shoes as well obviously does play a big factor like this uh i think it's called the dura cap is the all black that i got which is you know another cosmetic little layer to it i think there were a little bit more because of that i can't really remember to be honest but i'm willing to pay a little bit more if the shoe looks really cool but if it doesn't function you kind of have to evaluate it if it's worth it for you like i said i probably won't be buying these again unfortunately but i will be getting vans again i love van shoes let me know down below which ones i should try hey it was ruby's birthday the other day she was five years old i can't believe that i've had you for five years pretty cool not sure if you guys knew but i got a pro model skateboard i'm just kidding my wife got me this erica got me this for our wedding good pretty cool has all our memorabilia on a skateboard which is pretty dope i hope you guys enjoyed this quick little video on my vans the review normally i don't do product reviews but essentially sometimes i feel like it's cool to like give you an update on how a product is treating me and if i would buy it again so if you appreciate this video make sure you smash that like button underneath down below subscribe if you're not ready and we'll see you in the next one mash,2025-06-23 14:38:21.706008 UTC
ywNzIhBefWk,Vans Old Skool,so if you're looking for a versatile all-white casual sneaker that isn't going to break the bank then the vans old school all whites might be just what you're looking for stay tuned hey what's going on in this video we're going to be reviewing the vans all white old school canvas lows did i say you're right i think i said it right and we're just going to go over like the pricing you know the shoe itself would fit the styling and all that other good stuff to just help you decide if this should be your next purchase so without further ado let's get to the mean potatoes so let's start off with the sizing these fit true to size now i will say that the toe is a little bit tight up towards the front of it just because the canvas of it has a little bit of a slant but since it is canvas it does stretch a little bit so if you want to have that little extra space in there then go ahead and do a half size up but these do fit true to size i mean vance has had so long to get it right they definitely got it down on sizing i wouldn't say that it's a super slim fitting shoe um even if you have a wide foot you shouldn't have that much of a problem getting your regular size in them let me let me go ahead and grab one really quick for you they are like i said they are a slim fitting shoe but they open up towards once you get towards the toe box and kind of slim back down just like any other normal shoe this is why i have it written down you know and it kind of is going to depend on how tight you lace them to now one quick thing i do want to add with the canvas old schools unlike the authentics they have the jazz stripe on them and this giant stripe is actually leather not canvas that's why you can kind of tell that it's a different color now these used to be all white but i used a trash ass shoe cleaner and it pretty much yellowed them that last let's not even get into that the whites look a little bit different when you get them brand new and you keep them clean and stuff as far as comfort it is a pretty flat sole but there's a decent amount of cushion in there this is a skate shoe at the end of the day this was made for skating and that's what it feels like after a while your feet just gonna start to hurt it's not a walking shoe it's not an athletic shoe or anything it's a skate shoe i wouldn't expect anything else from it it's not too bad overall if you want to just wear them out on the town or a day at school day at work or something like that you can i think you shouldn't have much of a problem with them for those of you who may be wondering these actually aren't going to add a lot of height to you um i know the the bottom sole actually looks like there's a lot to it but probably get like a half an inch of height out of it so if that is something that you're concerned about because it's such a flat-footed shoe then you know maybe slide some lips in there i don't i don't know now the pricing i got these in late august from journeys for 64 total that's including tax and everything so it really is an affordable shoe that's not going to break the bank i only say in late august because seasonally it depends when you buy them you know towards spring and stuff the price might tick up a little bit towards the 70s just because they become more in demand around that time you know but if you look they retail for 60 on the band's website so if your local store is like trying to sell you them for 75 or something like that just go look online go straight to the van store and they should be 60 retail maybe with shipping you'll probably end up paying that 70 or so but you know shop around because apparently vans in australia cost a bunch more i don't know why but i kept seeing that i was looking at other reviews like are they good are they out there shaffy yo in australia for vans like now the outer sole is a little bit thick it's like a thick rubber so even though they are a canvas shoe they might take a little bit of breaking in probably like two weeks or so before you really get a good comfort in there you can actually get these in all leather as well same style and everything but if you want them in all leather they do have them for in all leather and they should cost about the same i mean it might be like a five to ten dollar price difference now after i did kind of ruin these with that shoe cleaner or whatever and then start wearing them to the gym and they actually make a really good shoe for the gym maybe not running and stuff but you know it's really flat-footed and if you're into that kind of thing you know what i'm talking about so who are these for damn near anybody really vans have been around since before i was born it will probably be around after i die honestly you know they have such a wide variety of colors and everything that it's it's hard not to find something that you might like if you don't like these look at the authentics they have a little bit cleaner look to them without maybe some of the stitching patterns and stuff like it's hard to say an all-white shoe like this is it's hard for anybody to go wrong with it if you're in high school you wear these bad boys down here every day and be good if you're in college does anybody even care in college nobody cares what you wear in college let's be real you know if you got a casual workspace you could probably slide these on and get away with it pretty easily it's going to be a kind of thing that's based on you i don't know why i didn't put the laces in these damn things i hope that helps and i will see y'all in the next one oh yeah don't forget to subscribe and stuff like that in case you want to see more content like this,2025-06-23 14:38:24.553469 UTC
pcROhozIjFk,New Balance 990,so in this video I wanted to give you guys five reasons why I think you guys should try the New Balance 990 V6 let's go ahead and jump in the video let's get into some words of what new balance says about the product first this is the New Balance made in the USA 990 V6 the retail is a little bit steep at 199.99 the 990s original design we're tasked with creating the single best running shoe in the market the finished product more than lived up to its billing when it hit shelves for the first time in 1982 the 990 sported in an elegantly understated gray colorway and a then unheard of three-figure price tag for Avid Runners and ahead of the curve tastemakers alike the 990s were Mark of quality and Superior taste there have been updates to the design since 1982 and more color options but the 990 status symbol Aura has never changed simply put the 990 as a shoe so good that we've never stopped making it for the latest generation model the 990 V6 features a streamlined take on the mesh paneling and suede overlay Construction Plus Fuel Cell and end cap midsole Technologies the subtle and refined modernization offers an up-to-date Pinnacle experience in the 990. so now that we have a little bit of background of the shoe my first impressions out of the box I mean it looks like a new revised version of a new balance 990 sneaker it's pretty easily distinguishable from the 990v5 because in the midsole it's much larger it does still feature the end cap on that as well but it does have the fuel cell which is definitely a distinguishable feature as well as just the overall panels on the side and stuff are a little bit different also the dpu plastic Wings on the side of the V5 are gone and now you just have a reflective panel over there instead but I wanted to give you guys some reasons why I think you guys should actually consider this pair of sneakers so let's go ahead and jump into those the first one is history they were introduced in 1982 while the Air Jordan 1 released in 1985. so this has a very long-standing history 90 110 are these 40 years old I didn't realize they were that old that's crazy so the original Air Jordan Ones came out in 1985 and then you have the numerical sequences every single year where they release a new Jordan and now it is 37 years later and they have the Air Jordan 37 but here's where things are vastly different between New Balance and what Jordan brand has created New Balances maintain the same lineage with the 990 series with the history of the cut and so uppers and stuff on the New Balance lineage and they've maintained that same Integrity to the modern day 40 years later meanwhile in Jordan Brown already kind of know that the luster is the Air Jordan 1-13 ending after the 13 or maybe the 14 is just trash quote unquote and most sneakerheads eyes and then when you're talking about the modern products from like the 2009's onwards to the Air Jordan 37s now they're really just strictly a technical performance product there's nothing about them that say lifestyle and they don't segue over to the lifestyle segment of sneakers in the modern times which is a huge fail if you ask me from the Jordan brand perspective meanwhile new balance is taking a shoe that's over 40 years old and while we haven't had 40 different versions of the model they did pivot from a strictly running sneaker to more like lifestyle segment this isn't a current running shoe really in this day and age they have a running segment that's incredible with fuel cell and fresh foam and stuff they have flourished on that side of things but the 990 model has really maintained the Integrity that it really had when it was first introduced is one of the first hundred dollar shoes to hit the market and that's why I think that new balance and what they're doing here far exceeds what Jordan brand has done with their latest and greatest models like the Air Jordan 37 the Air Jordan 37 sales are going to be stuck on that narrow funnel of performance meanwhile these have a segment for lifestyle which is pretty massive if you ask me I honestly wanted to do like a clickbaity title with how these are better than Jordans but I couldn't figure out how to do it eloquently without people like trolling me but if you really think about what they've done with this product the fact that it's relevant and the fact that they keep creating new versions like Jordan brand can't create a new pair of Air Jordan 4s or fives or anything like that like those ones are amazing but when they do the hybrid Jordans everybody hates those meanwhile New Balance has created a new model with the same sort of a TLC that the originals had with the cut and so uppers on the shoe modernized it a bit but really it has the same Integrity like I said of the previous products and although it would be fun to see Jordan brand do something like that I don't think we'll ever see that happen Jordan Brands captured that retro Nostalgia but how many times can they keep doing the threes fours and fives over and over again they can't create something new which is why what I think that new balance is doing creating the new version of something that looks older like this is like just ahead of the curve if you ask me that was only the first reason to consider buying these the second reason though is the cut and so made in the USA look is definitely a plus it's traditional materials maintains a Timeless look and feel and to the untrained eye it might just look like a new colorway of an already existing New Balance model but it is a new model and it is made in the USA I think that that is also something that is very very important about what new balance is creating especially with that made in the USA collection and if you guys want to buy these or anything from the made in the USA collection I'll link them directly in the description of the video If you guys make any of those purchases I do get a little bit of a kickback from New Balance and lets them know that you guys rock with my channel it's greatly appreciated when you guys do that but there's something about modern sneakers that are made with cut and sew techniques that are not Retros that's just always so fun to see and for 40 years of doing the same exact thing it's pretty rad third reason why I think you should consider buying these is the most comfortable version in my opinion of the 990 VX series that I've tried or any of the 990s for that matter because of the fuel cell midsole now I will say it's not as comfortable as the regular fuel cell stuff out there because if you guys know my channel you guys know I love the fresh foam and their fuel cell line there's like five main shoes that I think are absolutely amazing you have that Fresh Foam x1080 V12 which is absolutely amazing everyday shoe you have the Fresh Foam X more V4 which is unbelievable as well and then you have the hero V7 Gore-Tex which has a really nice fresh foam in that but then we have the fuel cell Rebel V3 which is incredibly soft and Squishy with the fuel cell on that very lightweight as well and then my favorite of all of them the fuel cell super comp trainers unbelievable stack of fuel cell in that model just super crazy soft squishy responsive goodness in that I don't feel like this is the same fuel cell compound as in those shoes because those shoes are incredibly soft but the fact that they have a softer foam compound inside this midsole it's actually a lot softer on feet than the previous versions of the v5s or any of the 990s for that matter it really felt soft and definitely like a little bit of Squish going on in there now I do wish that they would label the fuel cells like fuel cell compound one versus two or something to make us know that they're like a difference in the uh compound because this is definitely firmer like I said but still really good and still a nice welcome addition and to be 100 honest they shouldn't use like the regular fuel cell in this shoe because if they did it would be way too soft and Squishy and it would alienate probably a lot of the people that really like the 990 lineage because of the overall structure and feel of the other 990s this would be way too soft on feet then and people wouldn't even know what to do with them like you lose a little bit of stability structure when you go too soft and so I like the fact that they still have the end cap here that gives it the stability but you do get a little bit of extra soft squishiness the next reason why I think you should try these shoes is the wide foot friendly gang out there you're gonna love these things man they're so wide foot friendly and they have so many wide versions of the shoe if you're a bigger person you have extremely wide feet you're going to want to try these shoes and get the wide versions or the extra wide versions they have them on New Balances side they even have a narrow version in select size is pretty crazy easy I actually got a wide version of this which might have been a mistake because I honestly don't need as wide of a shoe as this one offers new balance is serious with its wide feed gang and uh and some of the shoes I need wide like the rebel fuel cells I need wide versions in those because they're very narrow it's like a performance running shoe right this is not this is a lifestyle shoe for the most part lifestyle shoes or like the more v4s for the fresh foam stuff I need the regular versions not the wide versions because the wides are a little bit too big even for me in the toe box section So for anybody looking for a wide foot friendly shoe and you like the the 990 Vibes like this one is definitely a plus and the last reason why I think you guys should try the new balance 990v6 is because you can and what I mean by that is that they're available they're not selling out they're sitting out there in sizes for a purpose they created a bunch of them and this is like the gray colorway which gray and new balance is like white and red and black and Air Jordans and stuff it's kind of like their traditional um color blocking on their shoes so you can get the gray colorway in all different shapes and sizes and extra wide and narrow and they have them in a ton of different sizes on new balance's side they also do have kid versions and women's versions as well as for sneaker sizing I would say personally they're true to size 9.5 is what I should have gone with or I could have gone a nine wide maybe instead or I could have just gone a 9.5 regular any which way the 9.5 wide is a little bit too wide in the forefoot for me so I'm going to return these and get a regular 9.5 instead that's the size I'm going with I did an overall Comfort rating would probably be like a 7 out of ten like it's the most comfortable 990 for sure hands down out of any of the ones that I've tried 992s 997s I've tried a lot of different ones but this one is the most comfortable of all of them because of the fuel cell in the midsole however I give it a seven because it's not like the most comfortable across the board of like Comfort sneakers Comfort sneakers right now are like insane there's so many crazy crazy good ones these are still really comfortable just not uh to the level of like the fuel cell uh super comp trainers the aesthetic rating I'd give it like a 7.9 out of 10. I do like the updated look of the shoe I think that it's really Sleek looking and even though the lineage is like 40 years old I like Evolution that it's made from the previous version even from the v5s to the v6s definitely like the V6 design better alternative options on a lifestyle model that you guys are maybe interested in I would say the 90s 60s are actually really nice as well those are about 150 save you 50 bucks it's not going to have the 990 luster in my opinion but the quality materials are amazing on the 90s 60s and I love the overall look it has a really nice Vibe with the midsole it's a little bit chunky on those ones I really like those also for an even cheaper option and you want something from the 990 lineage there is a 997s a new balance's side I believe those ones are right around 100 and so it's a really great buy if you want something that looks pretty stylish but not as expensive as something like this just throwing those options out there if you guys want to buy either of those or check them out I'll link them in the description but anyway My overall final thoughts I think that it's a nice looking model it's great to see them evolving the line 40 years in introducing fuel cell in the midsole is a nice Plus for myself really like the fuel cell branding on here and the Comfort again not as good as maybe traditional fuel sell Sneakers but like for the traditional 990s these things are by far the most comfortable in 990s in my opinion that I've tried on uh give you a little bit more heels question than the average one for sure the reflective hits are really nice as well the fact that they have wide foot friendly is super awesome also the only downside is that price point at 200 is going to deter a lot of people but it's very easy to pick up for those people looking which is a plus I'll leave it at that hope you guys enjoyed the video if you guys want to buy a pair check Link in the description again if you guys use my links it lets New Balance know that you guys appreciate the channel and the review if you guys do like the video in the review please drop a like on the video as well subscribe to my channel notification Bell to uh check out my other videos and have a good rest of the day hopefully we'll see you back on the channel for some more content alright peace guys,2025-06-23 14:42:44.134702 UTC
G3WEI-6wfIY,New balance 550,so in today's video i'm gonna go over a month-long review of this sneaker which is the new balance 550 and this burgundy cyan colorway in case you're new to the channel my name is oliver i love talking about sneakers giving reviews as well as some like historical background on some sneakers so in case you like that type of stuff feel free to subscribe all right so this is the new balance 550 this is the burgundy cyan colorway and this is a gr pair i actually made a previous video on this detailing my first impressions as well as the initial review of the shoe and i'll leave a link to that here if you in case you want to check that out so i've been wearing this sneaker now for the past month or so i've been averaging about one to three miles in these every single day so i guess to round that out i think i've been doing about maybe 45 to 50 miles in this so far so i think i have a pretty good impression on how the sneaker performs as a walking shoe and its comfortability so i guess i'll start off with the pros the pros of this is that the sneaker is still super clean if you look at it from a visual perspective it doesn't look beat up at all despite being worn for so many miles and if you look at the toe it doesn't really look creased i'll dive into that a little bit later but i guess from a creasing standpoint this leather is pretty good so that's something to know in case you want like really clean looking sneakers with minimal upkeep like i haven't done any cleaning on these whatsoever i've just maybe like wiped them off a little bit every now and then but yeah for the most part these are still very clean to look at so i guess the other thing is the comfort's still there the ortholite insole hasn't bottomed out whatsoever it's so fairly comfortable to wear at least from the cushioning perspective and for a shoe that traditionally lacks any type of like real type of cushioning the ortholite insole does some pretty serious work so kudos to knee balance and ortholite for providing like a very comfortable insole all right so now we're gonna dive into the cons and i'm gonna bring up that whole thing about the leather quality very shortly i think the leather on this is actually too thick and it's very stiff and it's actually very painful in one part of the shoe like it's very strange that it's localized to just my left foot but my right shoe is fine but my left shoe is like insanely painful and basically what happens is that there's this crease point in between this like front lace and the toe where essentially when it creases like that it creates a pressure point right above where my big toe would be bending so that's super painful and that as you can already tell that's going to occur on every single step so what i've noticed is that the first 10 minutes of a walk it's like basically me shuffling my feet around to try to mitigate that pain as much as possible but yeah for some reason it just keeps occurring no matter how many miles i wear the shoe and it's kind of disorienting honestly and i'm kind of disappointed because like you know for a gr pair i would imagine that this should be a fairly comfortable sneaker on the box but because of the leather being so thick it doesn't really give it much room to breathe it doesn't give it like that softness that suppleness that you get on like all my leon door pair so i have that pair right here basically i'll do a side to side comparison essentially the the leather on this amelian door pair is very supple and it's very very soft the gr pair here is very stiff i don't know what it is but it's very painful like it's not pleasant to wear so you know new balance if you're watching this like you got to really think about what you're putting into this type of leather because this is not breaking in and i've been wearing this a lot i think the primary reason is because this leather is super super thick and it just doesn't crease so i think the way it creases actually causes the leather to bunch up and create pressure points across that like walking motion so yeah honestly this is pretty painful and i hope it goes away at some point and you know i'm gonna keep doing this like manually i'm gonna keep like punching the sneaker too in fact if you've also had this pain as well feel free to leave in the comment section below if you were able to fix it let me know how you did it right now i'm just resorting to like punching the shoe i've been resorting to like manually creasing it myself so you know if there's a better way to do so i'd love to know how you did it sorry that video was slightly more negative but i thought that would be a very informative review trust me i'm not being paid by anyone to make this so i think this is a pretty unbiased perspective and i've actually been wearing this shoe quite a bit and you despite the pain i actually have persisted and try to wear as much as i can so yeah i hope this video was helpful in case you're trying to look for buying a pair of these yourself you know honestly maybe i just had an unlucky pair myself maybe other people will have better experiences but you know this is something that i was a little bit disappointed over just to be honest with you i've had a lot of new balances in the past and this is the only time i've ever faced like such an issue where i couldn't even walk in the shoe properly for the first like 10-15 minutes definitely something to keep notice in case you have very wide feet yourself all right well thanks so much for watching if you found this video really helpful feel free to leave a comment below i really like hearing your guys feedback if you liked what you saw too feel free to like and subscribe definitely appreciate all the support on all the videos so far all right until next time then i'll see you in the next video cheers,2025-06-23 14:50:48.643743 UTC
cbY8NsSr0LY,Yeezy 350 v2,so it kind of seems like kanye west and adidas are going back to basics when it comes to 350 v2s and there's really no better example of that than the upcoming dazzling blue colorway what's up everybody i'm seth fowler and today i'm reviewing the upcoming yeezy boost 350 v2 dazzling blue before we dive into the video i want to give a huge thank you to the sponsor and also the people that made this video possible because they literally sent me this pair of shoes and that's kix world so with someone who has a pretty serious sneaker addiction it's always a struggle for me to not spend money on sneakers and to be honest it's not so much to spending money on sneakers that bothers me it's spending money on sneakers that i end up not even wearing and for me kicks world has really solved that problem because kicks is a monthly subscription service that allows you to try sneakers before you buy them and what i love about that is you can actually wear the sneakers around try them on with different outfits and keep them for a month to decide if this is really a pair of sneakers you want to spend money on and if you decide to actually grab one of the sneakers that you got from kicks you can use part of your monthly subscription fee to go towards the cost of those sneakers so not only are you able to try the sneakers before you buy them you can also get them at a cheaper cost than you would be able to from somewhere else so if you'd like to check out kick's world for yourself and try sneakers before you drop the money on them i definitely recommend checking out kicks world by clicking the link in the top of the description and like i said big thank you to kix for providing the sneakers in today's video because if it wasn't for them we wouldn't have this early review so shout out to kicks for that but now on to how you can grab a pair of yeezy boost 350 dazzling blues for yourself i was just trying to check the release date for this pair of sneakers but there's like five other sneakers i need to enter for in the confirmed app so i've just been spending so much time just doing that so the dazzling blue 350s officially released on february 26th through the confirmed app and some other standard yeezy places like yeezysupply.com for a slightly higher than usual retail price of 230 bucks and as far as stock numbers and how difficult this shoe will be to get i have no idea but just based on the fact that this shoe looks so much like some of the more popular 350 v2s i would assume that the hype for this sneaker is going to be pretty high compared to most other 350 v2 releases so i guess my advice as far as release procedures go if you want to grab these shoes enter every raffle you can be on yeezysupply.com right when they drop do all that sort of good stuff and uh you might have a shot at grabbing these for retail but with all that being said why don't we dig a little bit deeper into the dazzling blue 350s and find out what makes this colorway of the shoe so dazzling that was a stretch so the first thing you might have noticed about this shoe is how similar the color blocking of this shoe is to some of the more popular and original 350 v2s after the first release of the 350 v2s in 2016 in the beluga colorway adidas and yeezy decided to drop a couple more color ways before the end of the year that came in a primarily black with accent color look those color ways included the red stripes the olives the coppers and even the oreos and all four of those colorways have become some of the most popular pairs of 350 v2s to release so it just makes sense that kanye and adidas are trying to recapture some of that 350 v2 hype by releasing a colorway that's pretty similar to those four color ways however they did change things up just a little bit by changing the accent color on the shoe to a bright blue which we don't often see on pairs of 350s and based on the success of those colorways i'm actually surprised at how long it took adidas and easy to release a new variant of those shoes it's kind of weird that it took them what is it like six years i mean i'm genuinely surprised that it took them six years to drop this shoe and i think the idea with this release or the thought behind this colorway release is that yeezy and adidas are trying to recapture some of that hype that they lost with the 350 v2s the 350v2s have become more of like a mainstay sneaker like the air force ones which are still popular shoes but they're not really hyped up and i think adidas is really trying to strike that balance between an everyday shoe that everyone wears all the time and a hyped up sneaker that people just covet and so in my opinion the dazzling blue 350s are adidas's attempt at recapturing the hype and trying to create that balance between hyped up and everyday wears but getting into the materials on this shoe the first thing that you probably noticed is this black primeknit upper now while this shoe might look and feel very similar to every other black pair of 350 v2s that use the same primeknit pattern apparently they've actually changed up the materials in this upper and now we're utilizing some form of recycled materials and that's actually evident from the sustainability logo found on one of the insoles of the shoe they did the same thing on the compact 350s and i believe on a pair of mnvn's but this is the first time they've changed up the materials on the 350v2s and honestly it looks like a standard pair of 350s it feels like a standard pair of 350s and i'm really into the fact that adidas is really implementing this sustainable material usage in their more hyped-up sneakers that a lot of people will be buying it's really cool to see adidas do now to be fair i don't know what percentage of the yarn used in the upper of this shoe or the materials used in the shoe are actually recycled or sustainable but no matter the percentage it is cool to see adidas take their yeezy line and create something that's sustainable which i dig like i just said the primeknit use in the upper of this shoe feels just like standard primeknit used on 350v2s the primeknit pattern that we see on this shoe is the same as we saw with the belugas and all of the black 350v2s that released around the same time on the medial side or inside of the shoe it just looks black at first glance but if you really take a closer look you'll notice these blue speckles that almost create this really cool wavy pattern which i've always liked about the original 350 v2s and you can actually find more of this blue speckling throughout the primeknit both on the medial and on the lateral side of the shoe on the lateral side or outside of the shoe it's really only found on the bottom part and the top part of the upper but it's still there but now let's get to the most dazzling detail of the entire shoe i need to stop doing that that sucks you've got this dazzling blue stripe so unlike most recent 350 v2s this stripe comes in just a standard primeknit and not in some sort of like plastic mesh or rip stop material which i really like i'm actually a really big fan of the shade of blue that they used on this sneaker i feel like it's very vibrant it's very clean and it's different than really anything that we've seen on a pair of 350 v2s of course in the middle of the stripe you've got your classic sply 350 text that's embroidered in a black primeknit no one's ever been able to confirm what the spli stands for but in my opinion it's always stood for supply i don't get the people who think it stands for anything else but that's just my opinion kanye if you want to chime in anytime and let us know what that means that would be great also if you're watching this video thank you for watching this video big fan but uh yeah just kind of seems like one of those mysteries of the yeezy boost 350 is one that i don't think will ever be solved one of my favorite things about this older 350 v2 design is the way that the stripe sort of pixelates into nothing towards the toe and the heel of the shoe and something else i like about this older design as well is that the stripe doesn't end prematurely on the shoe like a lot of the newer designs the stripe kind of ended here but on these older ones it ends literally right at the center of the shoe on both the front and the back of the sneaker in fact on the heel of the shoe it actually fades into the medial side which i really like it's just a really clean look and one that i've missed on 350 v2s another interesting detail is that just below this blue stripe you have a separate black stripe that although you can't really see it it does texture-wise change up the side of the sneaker it's not your standard primeknit texture it just comes in this flat black embroidery which in my opinion creates this really nice subtle contrast between this and the rest of the upper of the shoe i think it's a really nice touch and all in all while i don't think this design is groundbreaking this is exactly what i wanted from yeezy i wanted different colors i wanted something that is easy to rock i wish they had dropped this colorway like three years ago when i was still wearing 350s every day i don't really wear them as much anymore i still rock them but not as often maybe this colorway will sort of convince me to rock them although not this exact pair because kicks sent me a size eight because that's all they had and i'm a size nine so this probably won't fit very well as you guys will see in the on foot portions of this video that being said though did you guys peep the apothecary essential socks that i'm rocking the outfit portion man they look good and if you guys want to grab a pair for yourself or a couple pairs you can actually grab them through the merch bar just below this video that is if you're using an iphone ipad or something that doesn't have ad block on it if you do have adblock you can grab them at apothecary.com which is linked in the description below all that aside i feel like the dazzling blue 350 v2s are a very clean colorway and are super easy to rock as far as the laces that come with this shoe as you probably could have expected they come with your standard black rope laces they match the upper of the shoe very well no 3m hits which i'm not mad at then moving inside the shoe you've got a black sock liner around the back of the heel as well as the adidas 3 stripes in reflective material then rounding off the inside of the shoe you've got a black insole with the yeezy adidas and sustainability logos printed on the heel in blue but now getting to sizing and fit of the dazzling blues like i said this shoe is a size eight so it's a full size down from my standard size i was able to squeeze my foot into the shoe for the on for portion of this video but unfortunately because this shoe is not my size i can't give you guys exact sizing advice on this sneaker what i will say though is that based on the construction and overall look of the shoe and what i've heard from other people the shoe does fit like a standard pair of 350 v2s and that means if you're grabbing this shoe grab a half size up because this shoe probably does fit half size small so if you're like me a size nine grab a size nine and a half in the shoe if you're a size 10 grab a size 10 and a half and so on it's kind of your standard 350 v2 deal it's not really any new construction it's more of the same even though the materials are different the actual fit isn't any different so keep that in mind but then moving down on the sneaker you get to your standard and iconic yeezy boost 350 v2 ribbed outsole in this case it comes in sort of a dark smoky grey and you can sort of see through the boost underneath but not that well and then finally moving to the bottom of the sneaker you've got more of that same rubber on the outsole and of course your cutouts through to the boost now if you've never worn a pair of 350 v2s before i've got to say that they are a very comfortable shoe you've got a full length boost midsole which is super soft underfoot the primeknit is relatively stretchy and pretty breathable the one problem that i have is around the toe area of the shoe it kind of comes to a point which is not great for your toes it almost smashes them together but other than that and especially if you grab the right size you should be totally fine so to round off this review of the 350v2 dazzling blues in my opinion this is one of the best 350v2s to drop in a very long time no it's nothing crazy no it's nothing out there but at the end of the day this is what yeezy fans have been asking for a shoe that looks like the 350 v2s that we fell in love with with a little bit of a twist and i love that blue stripe on the side of the shoe i feel like it was a great color choice and i'm into it and when this shoe actually releases on february 26th i will definitely be going for a pair of these myself hopefully i can grab a pair if not you know it is what it is but i'd really like to have a pair of these but at this point i would love to know your thoughts on the upcoming dazzling blue 350 v2s and whether this is a shoe that you're gonna be going for for yourself so make sure to let me know in the comment section down below and as always thank you so much for watching

JJ_ojK2irFE,Adidas Gazelle,so the Adidas sber the gazelle indor and the hble special which sneak is the best I get asked this question all the time and I've owned all three for quite a long time now so I thought I'd make a video to answer that question I'll be talking about the differences of each shoe the sizing the comfort and a lot more and I'll also let you know whether I think any of the pairs are worth picking up today or should they be left in 2023 if you like this video any point please feel free to drop it a like that would be lovely and now that's all out the way let's get into the sneakers so let's talk about the differences of each shoe first now there's no doubt about it all three pairs look very similar well one of my pairs is in green but if that was in Black they'd all look very similar but there are some key differences to each shoe so let's talk about them and let's talk about the materials first so typically the sber comes in leather with suede overlays whereas the other two pairs come with full suede uppers of course you can get each shoe in different materials but this is the most common makeup of each shoe and when it comes to shape the gazel do have a slightly different shape shaped toe box to the other two pairs the HBL and the sambers have a more rounded and longer toe box whereas the gazelle's is more angled and shorter and to those of you who might be worrying about the tow room in the gazel don't this is just for aesthetic purposes so you've still got plenty of tow room the same amount as the other two pairs I also think the handles have got a little bit less structure than the other two pairs when it comes to the toe box the camera might not pick it up that well but it's a little bit flatter and a little less sturdy the laces that come with the handles are rounded whereas the other two pairs have wider and flatter laces and while we're talking about laces the laces on my gazel are ridiculously long and I really don't like long laces but I suppose it is what it is but on the plus side the gazel do come with a second pair of laces in white which can look really nice my blue pair came with a white pair of laces and a blue pair of laces whereas my green pair just came with green laces so I'm not sure if they forgot to put the white ones in or that particular model doesn't come with white laces but if you you know then do let me know and I don't know if this is just me but I think from a bird's eye view the HBL look a little bit wider than the other two pairs maybe it's the rounded laces or maybe the laces don't pull in as tight but I don't know let me know what you think and with the soles the sber and the hambles are very similar they've got that dark gum sole which looks really nice but the gazel come with a lighter and more transparent sole which I really like I do much prefer the so on the gazel over the other two pairs I think it looks a lot cleaner and a lot more stylish the foxing on the gazel is a different shape to the other two pairs and I do prefer it on the gazel I hope that's called the foxing and if it's not then the suede overlays basically so overall I do prefer the shape of the gazel over the other two pairs so one point of the gazel I suppose but we're not done yet color plays a huge role in the look that each shoe gives off so let's talk about that next so with the hles I think they look great in black and Bolder brighter colors but I don't think they work well in white at all all I can't put my finger on why but I think they look a little bit tacky and white I just don't think they work that well but let me know if you agree or not of course this is just my opinion if you love them in white then of course get them in white but all I can give you is my opinion with the gazel I think they work best in brighter Bolder colors and the neutral colors don't excite me much I just think they look a little bit dull unless we're talking about the collaboration pairs well some of them like the Blondie pair for example I really like the look of those and when it comes to the samb I do think these are the best allrounder when it comes to color I think they work well in most colors they come in the most colors so you've got the most Choice with this shoe also if you're looking for a simple white clean sneaker then definitely go for these and ignore the other two I think these work so well in white but let's talk about comfort and sizing next so for me Adidas do run true to size I wear a size uk9 in Nike Vans Reebok and the same in Adidas but as I always say do try them on for yourself because everyone's feet shape is different you might have wider feet than me and when it comes to comfort if I'm trying them on straight out the box they all do feel quite similar but after long periods of where it's a different story I find the sambers can get quite tight around the laces area and they can get quite painful to wear it might be because the leather's a little bit tougher on the sber and the mid part of the shoe is a little bit narrower than the other two pairs this might just be a me thing but if it happens to you as well then do let us know I also found that back heel tab was an absolute pain in the heel when I first got them it rubbed all the skin off my heel there was blood in my sock it was an absolute mess and I definitely didn't look cool walking down the street in these after about four or five wees that problem went away but it is worth mentioning because it was pretty brutal I also find the handles can get a little bit tight at times as well but uh yeah the gazel I've had absolutely no problems with also with the gazel the laces don't come up as high on the shoe so your foot doesn't get locked in as well as the other two pairs so at first when I compared them to the other two shoes they did feel a little bit looser but this might be why they're more comfortable but just a side note if your main priority is comfort then it's probably best to look elsewhere these are lowprofile sneakers retro style sneakers at the end of the day so there isn't that much cushioning anyway let's talk about styling next so all three pairs they're all very simple they're all very basic so they are easy to style but it's the color way you choose to go for that's going to make things harder or easier for you if you choose a black pair or a white pair these are going to go with prettyy much everything so if you don't want to think too much then go for a pair of those and this is what made the black and white sambers so popular you can wear them with anything and they're probably going to look good but if you want to go for a more colorful pair then you do have to be a little bit more thoughtful with what you're going to wear with them so if you're already wearing quite a lot of color in your outfit a colorful pair of shoes might be a little bit too much and they might also clash with the rest of your outfit and sometimes if you're too matchy matchy with your shoes and another part of your outfit it can look a little bit too much as well but if you wear a lot of black clothing or neutral color clothing like I do then this isn't going to be a problem neutral colors aren't going to clash with a colorful pair of trainers so an all black outfit for example with a colorful pair of shoes is going to look great one thing I forgot to add in favor of the handles over the sambers in black is they do look a little bit smarter in my opinion the full suede upper just makes them look a little bit more sleek and yeah the sambas can look a little bit like an indoor football shoe I think I actually think the sambas might make a good indoor football shoe I think I might be on to something there but let me know what you think but now for the big question should you buy any of these sneakers today well it depends are you buying these sneakers to jump on a trend or do you genuinely love them and only you'll know the answer to that as we all know by now these three shoes have been trending for a while especially the sambers but I do think that Trend will start to die out soon and before you get angry at me nothing can Trend 100% of the time but just because something is going out of trend doesn't mean you shouldn't wear it and it doesn't make that item no longer stylish Timeless and classic pieces remain stylish no matter what the trends are doing and these are all classic shoes the sambas date back to the ' 50s well 1949 was the first shoe but it didn't look like the samb today then you've got the gazel in the' 60s and the HBL in the' 70s so it's safe to say these are all Timeless shoes and they've stood the test of time this isn't the first time they've been trending and it's not going to be the last time either but even when these sneakers aren't at the four of current trends they're still widely respected and they'll always have a place in fashion anyway I think I'm going a little bit too deep into this and at the end of the day it all comes down to do you love them or not and are you going to wear them even if the trend dies down if the answer is yes then there's never a bad time to pick up any of these pairs of sneakers and which pair would I recommend the most the pair that you love the most and the pair that you think you'll wear the most and it's as simple as that but I hope this helped and it didn't make things even more confusing for you if you like this video please do leave it a like don't forget to hit subscribe and thank you so much for watching see you later,2025-06-23

HqfywHZRAHo,New Balance 2002R,so there's a lot of reasons why the 2002 r is slowly becoming my favorite new balance silhouette and this sneaker kind of epitomizes that on today's episode we are reviewing the new balance 2002 r this is never that so the 2002 r ever since new balance brought it back from the archives officially known as previously the 2002. releasing back in 2010 new balance brought it back and kind of put a spin on it but new balance's formula is exactly spot on what they tend to do is make a collaboration with a new sneaker or one they're sort of bringing back and then they hit the ground running with the gr colorways we've seen it most notable with the 2002 rs and the 550s collaborations with the likes of amy leondor salehi bembry invincible and of course this is never that and this is never that is a korean streetwear brand that did collaborate with the 2002 r nearer its 2020 release but this 2022 downtown run colorway is as clean as it gets it did release with another silhouette by new balance the 1906 r and i'll be honest broskies that's the one i really wanted but i struck out i did kind of settle for these but at the same time i'm glad i did and broski's i'll leave some links down below so hopefully they're sitting a little bit so you can grab a pair now there's tons of reasons why this is one of the best 2002 rs to ever drop and there are a lot of 2002 rs that are top tier in my opinion from the likes of joe freshgoods like i've already mentioned salehi pembree invincible as well and of course the previous version to this is never that and not to forget technically the gr protection pack a lot of these colorways and silhouettes are absolutely amazing and the resale prices to some of those shoes really do reflect it but with all that said and done let's talk about this pair and start with the box now most 2002 rs especially the gr pairs do come with that plain gray box but of course this being a collaboration or they had to give us something it comes in that creamy color with the new balance branding all over it and on both sides the subtle this is never that logo it's a very simple and clean box but if you're anything like me and you collect boxes it will definitely stand out now the product sticker itself does say rth and of course i did go for my normal uk 9. now the only two things worth mentioning inside of the lid of the box it does have this is never that and then on that sort of bluey green tissue paper itself but there's no special hang tags and there's no spare laces so you're out of luck there so retailing at 150 pounds here in the uk compared to a normal gr pair that sort of retails for around 100 we will be touching on reasons why i think it is worth that 50 pound more but before that let's talk about the sizing now the 2002 rs i've never had a problem with the sizing i do tend to stick to my normal uk size in which is a uk 9. now i know there are some slight differences with uk and us sizing so you'll kind of have to figure that one out but the 2002 rs for me have always been true to size it's about time we take a look to see whether these are worth that 150 pound price tag and take an up-close and personal look now i'll be completely honest i'm absolutely loving this shoe and i didn't really want to because i weren't planning on keeping them but having these in hand and on foot especially i was like bruh these are going to be a problem the only sort of nitpick i can say is there's not enough branding from this is never that on the shoe but we'll touch more on that later the sneaker itself is predominantly in this gray color which for me new balance does do best and then we have hints of white and midnight navy now just to mention though there are a lot of reflective panels on this shoe which i'm a big big fan of the 3m detailing are on the end logos that little hint on the toe box too just on top of the tongue where the new balance running logo sits and lastly the nb logo towards the back at the hill counter and reflective panels on a shoe is always gonna win some brownie points for me but when it comes to the actual materials used there's a mixture of them here it is mostly nubuck but then we've got hints of furry suede as well but you'll be pleased to see the toe box is of course in mesh but when it comes to the tongue the ankle collar and even towards the back we've got that cracked leather look which is so so clean i'm not sure about durability wise though because those panels might flake off but hey we'll just have to wait and see there and the laces themselves they are pretty decent i mean they are what they are they might look better though with white laces so i might just try that out and towards the bottom half of the tongue we do have it in that mesh material and like i have mentioned we do have that cracked leather look around the new balance running logo which like most 2002 rs is nice and padded now the sock liner here is what really did surprise me it does feel so good on foot although it is your standard cotton it does have that silky feel to it so i have no complaints when it comes to having these on feet now just like the tissue paper we've got that sort of aqua blue green on the insole with the new balance logo and this is never that which is really perforated and it's not all for like like a lot of new balance sneakers but it does do its job now towards the back of the heel counter like i've already mentioned we have the 3m hits and the cracked material look as well but just to the side of it we have the 2002 r logo and those perforated hints towards the bottom now one of the biggest reasons why the 2002 r is slowly becoming one of my favorite sneakers is because of how comfortable it actually is and that is solely get it solely so midsole it's very comfy and cushioned on foot but at the same time it's not too soft like an ultra boost for example but saying that though it's not too firm compared to some of the 990 series defo got that sweet spot but it is mostly of this white colorway with hints of that midnight navy and again that grey and to finish off with the outsole it is pretty standard to the 2002 r here but the color blocking is exactly the same nothing really special here but the colorway in itself does pop so broski's we've come to that part of the video where we decide whether these are a buy or a buy now the 2002 r like i've mentioned already in the video is slowly becoming my favorite shoe and there's a lot of reasons why normally the gr pairs do go for around 100 to 110 pounds and the bang for your buck is absolutely amazing the comfort is actually pretty great for the price and the look and designs to the shoe are even better some of the colorways that have been released especially the materials are looking so good so good that you'd expect that from a collaboration pair but new balance have really been pushing the 2002 r and for good reasons they're super comfy they do look very cool and there's so many different color ways to choose from and like i've said the price is an absolute bargain although i'm going to argue with this particular pair 150 pounds might be a little too steep yes it is a collaboration don't get me wrong but it doesn't have that wow factor that normal collabs do have you wouldn't even be able to tell that it is a collab until you kind of look at the insole and you're like oh i get it normally some brands have a little branding on the shoe that they've worked on but this one is absolutely missing so that's the only downside to this sneaker but other than that this sneaker is absolutely banging the materials are top tier in my opinion and of course the cracks level look alongside the 3m detailing amazing and if you're already a 2002 r fan then these won't disappoint you i can definitely recommend these this 2002 r this is never that downtown run is an absolute fine now it's your turn to comment down below and let me know what you think about this silhouette is this one of the best 2002 r models to release and is this a silhouette that you've got your eye on leave it all down below and i will pin the best comments anyways my broskies thank you for watching thank you for supporting don't forget to hit me up on the ig as well because you guessed it i'm most active over there and don't forget to like

iCLHopEohVs,Air Jordan 1,so these off-white Jordan 1 uncs are fake and these right here are the actual off-white Jordan one UNC so first off The Fakes go for 40 on dhk and these are pretty nice but there are some differences to watch out for you can tell that the fonts are a little off on the inside and outside of the sneaker and the second tell is the quality of materials and also the angle of the stitching compared to the inside swoosh is way off but for forty dollars with these past the eye tests,2025-06-19 08:40:09.946876 UTC
B82OGicKM8g,New balance 550,so we have a new pair of sneakers from new balance in this video i actually was trying to buy these and ended up hitting on a pair of these on new balance's website which is actually a really rare w for me because i don't usually hit whenever they have releases where they have uh q and whatnot but i actually waited it out and got a pair of the new balance 550s most recently and this colorway is really dope there's a couple reasons why i really like this one that i'll get into this video but we're gonna discuss the new bounce 550 in 2022 what do you guys think is gonna happen with this one let's go ahead and get into the video what is going on guys here hopefully having a good day out there thank you guys for stopping by and watching if you guys are new to my channel you guys do enjoy the content please consider subscribing and if you guys haven't used collective kicks it's my website that i post a bunch of sneaker deals on it's always linked in the description of the video so here we have another pair of new balance 550s if you guys didn't see him one of my haul videos i did finally hit on a pair of 550s i've been trying to for half of like 2021 and i finally hit a pair at retail which was a big w at least it felt like it this is one of those sneaker models that's definitely had a lot of shine in 2021 i feel like we're definitely going to continue that wave in 2022. now we've seen a handful of different colorways come and sell out as well but i feel like some of those are going to come back in stock in fact new balance is site shows like the baby blue pair that ended up releasing when this orange one came out that one's going to be restocking at some point as well so i'm sure more products are going to be on the way but what do we think about the overall state of the new balance 550 because this is a shoe that new bounce has a lot of potential on we already see that new balance has a really large following with a 990 series this is like the new balance 990 v5s it's kind of like the go-to made in the usu that everybody loves supposedly they have the v6 coming out this year so i'm excited to get a pair of those hopefully whenever they come out but then there's a 990 v2s and threes and 992s and 993s as well there's so many different versions of the 99x's that basically they do get a lot of attention from collaborations and everything else in fact if you guys want to see a video of me breaking down like the differences between the 990 v1 two three four fives and the nine nine seven nine eight any of the nine nine series i can try to do like a comprehensive list video for you guys it'll be an educational journey for me as well because i don't know every single detail about all of those so if you guys want to see that though drop a like or comment in this video and let me know but back to the 550s this is like kind of like a rediscovered pair of sneakers ald or a million door like they did a collaboration with new balance i gotta say but i always say a million doors because i feel like it's a million one million doors that's how i pronounce it any which way ald did a collaboration with new balance to drop some 550s i think it was at the end of 2020 and then that one did really well 2022 2021 they restocked him as well as released a couple more colorways but they're kind of responsible for rebirthing this old basketball model from new balance and since then the 550s have really had its own cult following and something that we see more and more people trying to cut now i got this black and gray colorway from the last drop it's the marbled colorway or whatever you want to call it so to break down the colorway a little bit you have black leather across the toe cap of the shoe and then gray leather for the toe box looks like they perforated the leather a little bit here along the sides where the wings come together where the bottom laces are it does have 550 embroidered down here and then you have a puffy new balance logo on the side of the shoe with a white piping behind it but then you also have that white piping down the blocks of the shoe right here which is kind of cool it gives it a little bit of extra pop there you have a black nylon tongue on here as well on the back panel you do have black leather as well with the new balance logo in white and black gray mesh on the outside and then black mesh for the liner you have a nice heavy rubber midsole on the side of the shoe you have the new balance logo as well as the name new balance so double branding on the midsole and then up around the ankle support area you do have like a textured rubber as well so definitely some heavy duty thick boy materials there the midsole is kind of like a light gray or like off-white sort of color to it at least in my eyes i don't know maybe i'm just getting old the outsole is a non-marking sole that has gray as well as hits of white and black if you're looking for a thick heavy duty rubber outsole these things have them they're very heavy very thick the new balance 550 does fit true to size in my opinion i went half a size down with the orange pair and it's a little bit too snug so definitely true to size is a better option i really wanted the white and the silver colorway just because i thought it looked really clean as well but they didn't have any of them left in stock so this is the one i ended up with which i gotta say i'm actually pretty pleasantly surprised with if you're like me and you think that the new balance 550s remind you of like the nike air force one it really has like the same sort of build quality of like the air force one but that's one thing that i like about this colorway is like black air force ones there's kind of like a stigma too they're kind of frowned upon for sure but a black new balance 550 is not going to have that same stigma which is why i feel like this one's actually a really nice colorway i don't know if you guys noticed as well but i noticed a little branding switch on it it does say 550 on the side of the shoe on the box it says bb 550 other places they list them online as just 550 and then sometimes new balance will have it as bb 515. the bb is just for basketball obviously was an old retro basketball shoe that they brought back but sometimes the bb is dropping sometimes it's not i don't think there's a right or wrong but what do you guys think about the new bounce 550 in 2022 do you guys think that the hype on the model is going to stay through the year do you think that when colorways just come into stock they're just instantly going to sell out or do you think it's just going to kind of plateau and become more accessible for people that have been looking i feel like the air force one is like always constantly in demand but sometimes has its spikes so with rising spikes potentially in 2022 of the air force one we have the potential that the new balance 550 can kind of ride that wave as well and almost riding the wave in front of the the air force one but leave a comment and let me know what you guys think about the 550s leave some comments let me know what you guys think about some of the other lifestyle models from new balance and hope you guys enjoyed if you guys are trying to buy a pair i will link them over to new bots anyways have a good rest of the day and hopefully we'll see you back for some more sneaker videos soon alright peace guys,2025-06-23 14:50:47.639145 UTC
otq3_fnmpnY,New balance 550,so what do you call it when a snowman has a tantrum a meltdown um i didn't write that i promise perfect hello there broskies irkin here back with another video and on today's episodes just like my head is a very bold statement it is possibly the best white sneaker you can get right now it is indeed the new balance 550 in white now it is no secret that the new balance 550 is my favorite silhouette right now i've got about five colors to choose from now and i don't regret one of them they've each got something to him that make them so versatile and although my favorite pair is of course the ald collab in the natural green colorway this white one isn't far behind now i know this sneaker has been compared to the nike dunk and the nike air force one and even the adidas forum low this sneaker for me has a lot more going for it than those do but before you click off this video just hear me out the air force one is a timeless classic i'm not gonna say it's not but the all white version we all know that it just creases like mad even after like one or two wears don't get me wrong you can wear the crease guards the crease defenders and whatever else you want to put in it but at the end of the day it's still going to crease a little bit and putting those in it takes a lot away from the comfort now of course the aod collab was the one to bring back the new balance 550 from the archives and i thank god that he did but the colorways to those ald silhouettes are so much higher than retail but the gr colorways to the 550 aren't that bad either the likes of the syracuse colorway and the unc 2 they do look so good but of course this silhouette being mostly white is the most versatile shoe out of the lot depending on your outfits of course you can pull off so many different looks now looking at the box of course it does come in your new balance standard gr box which is sort of like a dark gray but on the product sticker itself it does say bb 550 pb1 now i actually paid i think 120 for these on ebay and i couldn't be bothered to wait for a restock so i just grabbed myself a nice little cheeky bargain from there depending on where you're buying from of course these did retail for 100 pounds so for me that 20 pounds over retail wasn't too bad now the 550 for me does fit true to size and that's because i go for my normal uk sizing if you do actually base it on your us sizing though i would say go half a size down to that sizing so short story long uk size in go true to size and us size in go half a size down so this being an all wet sneaker and all i think it's about right we have an up close and personal look so the 550 silhouette is as clean and as simple as it gets in most colorways anyway and this white version is no exception now although mostly this is a white sneaker it does have hints of grey around it too and i've got to say it does work in its favor but if you're new to the 550 most of the shoe is of course in this leather finish and on both sides of the shoe we have the n logo and just in case you forget what model this is we've got the 550 branding on the lateral side and we've got that double layer to the toe box and it does work well here now if you're worried about creasing i don't think the 550 is one silhouette to worry about as long as you're stuffing them with tissue after or using a shoe tree i think you're all good i've not had any issues with decreasing now the lacing is pretty standard here it comes with white laces as well now the tongue is mainly made of mesh but on the top of it of course we've got the new balance 550 brand in there with the envy logo on top of that basketball of course originally signifying it was made for basketball way back in 1989. now on the ankle collar of course is in that white mesh now the awful light insole inside is in black with the white envy logo there and this for me is what makes it such a comfortable basketball shoe now making our way to the hill counter we have that mesh at the top again and then we have that leather panel with the mb logo there too and the logo is sort of a mixture between sort of gray slash silver and of course white now the midsole is your standard 550 setup here with the sort of creamy look to it with hints of gray as well where we do have on the lateral side that new balance brand in there and then the medial side we have that sort of exposed foam i'm going to say now according to new balance we have this non-marking outsole here predominantly in grey with hints of white again and of all things i've got to say about the outsole it does have great traction so the 550 been one of the most popular silhouettes over the past year or two let's decide together broski's whether this is a buy or a buy now the silhouette in itself has gained so much traction over the past year especially and i can only see in it gaining more popularity as more colorways and more collabs come out other than the rich pools the aods and some other collabs to come out i think we've got that size pack coming very very soon and they've got such a different spin on it they've used suede panels to the upper and although i'm gonna probably go for all three pairs i do think the leather finish to this sneaker is what makes it if it's pouring down with rain outside i can just grab one of my 550s and not have to worry about it and to be fair it just adds that basketball aesthetic even more when it comes in leather well of course different strokes for different blokes it's all down to what you prefer now the 550 by new balance is one of those sneakers that i think swaying a lot more people now when they first come out people were like nah not me bro but as more colorways and collabs come out a lot more people are getting interested in them and i can't lie it's always been hard to cop them but now it's getting ridiculous and there have been a lot more restocks especially to the white pair the orange pair the unc and i think that white and red colorway as well as far as i can see they're getting like restocks at least once a month and as we approach summer i can only see more restocks come into this white pair as well but to be fair the resale prices aren't that bad so if you want to grab yourself a pair i'd say pull the trigger now but anyways broskies let's put that syrup away because we've waffled on too much already to summarize i've got to say this is an absolute no-brainer this is an absolute buy just like your tv turning off i do stand by what i did say earlier this is the best overall white sneaker you could get right now the comfort to that awful light insoles and of course the look and feel to the shoe you don't have to worry about creases or worrying about hurting your feet after a couple hours of wearing this shoe but i am interested to know what you think broskies are you a fan of the 550 silhouettes and do you own any colorways to it leave it all down below and i will pin the best comments anyways broskies thank you for watching thank you for stopping by don't forget to hit me up on my ig as well and don't forget to like subscribe comment and share and of course until the next episode see you later alligator you,2025-06-23 14:50:47.650873 UTC
UWyFXl4vQEA,Adidas Gazelle,so you may have noticed that recently classic Adidas models have started to get really popular again and for several reasons they're pretty low profile they come in a lot of great colorways and they're very easy to style now you might be interested in purchasing a pair of Adidas but you just don't know which one there are quite a few different options so in this video I'm going to go through four of the most popular Adidas models tell you what are the differences between them and also tell you how they fit because they all do fit differently and those are the sambas the gazelles the campus and the Adidas Superstars let's go starting off with this pair the Adidas Samba which right now you could argue might be the most popular of all Adidas models thanks in large part to popular influencers wearing them all over social media and also thanks to these now this is the Adidas Samba collaboration with Wales Bonner that came out last year and this was the pair that really kick-started the comeback of the Adidas Samba in 2022. the interesting thing about these shoes is that they were initially designed for playing soccer or football on icy surfaces and that's because of this rubber outsole that gives you that nice grip these shoes are quite narrow compared to almost all other Adidas models and you can see that just by looking at the outsole look how narrow the shoe gets in the midfoot area and for that reason it is highly recommended to go a half size up in these than your true size I am a true size 11 that's what I wear an almost all Nike sneakers like Nike Dunks and Air Maxes and also Jordan Ones and New Balance 550s but in this pair right here I definitely need to go up half a size to an 11 and a half now if you have wide feet unfortunately the Adidas Samba is just not a very good shoe for you because even going a half size up you might find the shoe a bit too tight and going a full size up is not really recommended because you're just going to have way too much room in the toe box it's just not a very wide foot friendly shoe unfortunately now you may notice that there are several different versions of the Adidas Samba available there is the samba classic and these come with that really long tongue forel recently did a collab on that model there is the samba OG these are usually made out of leather and they come with that shorter tongue these are definitely the most popular of all of these Samba models you also have the samba vegan which is made out of synthetic materials and they are slightly cheaper and you also got the Velo sambas and this was a pair that was specifically designed for cycling and all of these sambas fit the same go a half size up from your true size the next sneaker we're going to be talking about is the Adidas Gazelles they are very similar looking to the sambas however there is one major difference and that is that they're not as narrow as the sambas they're much wider in the midfoot and the toe box so naturally they do fit very different for me I go a half size down for my true size and Adidas Gazelles as I said I normally wear a size 11 so in the gazelles I fit perfectly at a 10 and a half which is a full size lower than the Adidas sambas yeah I told you guys Adidas shoes fit very differently if you do have wide feet however you can go true to size and they still will fit fine with the gazelles 2 a very interesting history now these were originally designed to play another Sport and that is handball and it was also one of the first performance shoes ever to feature a suede upper now with the gazelles as well there are several different versions you can get your regular Adidas Gazelles they're usually made out of suede and they have a standard outsole and this pair right here is actually the gazelle indoor so they have a different gum outsole this particular pair is very different it is a special collab between Adidas and Gucci and it's simply one of my favorite shoes that I own there's also a newer version of the gazelle that just got released called the gazelle bold which actually features a triple stacked outsole a very interesting shoe for all of these gazelle models like I said you want to be going down half a size from your true size to get the best fit very quickly if you've been finding this video useful so far make sure you hit that like button it really does help me out and helps push this video to a wider audience and if this is your first time on the channel my name is Josh I'm dropping sneaker content at least three videos a week so make sure you hit that subscribe button to stay up to date the next sneaker we're going to talk about is the Adidas campus a basketball sneaker from the 80s and it's a bit of an underrated shoe it doesn't get as much much love as the sambas and the gazelles but it's still pretty popular and although the difference is quite subtle these are in fact chunkier than the previous two shoes these also have more padding on the tongue they're almost like a skateboarding shoe type of tongue and materials wise these are typically made out of nubuck not this particular version this is the collaboration with South Park so it's made out of this towel like material but normally they're made out of nubuck for sizing on this pair they fit the same as the gazelles so for me that is a half size down than my true size and just like all the Adidas shoes these also come in many different versions the most popular being the campus 80s which is just like the pair you see right here you also have the campus 2000s which are normally made out of suede and have thicker Adidas Stripes as well as thicker laces and finally there's also the campus ADV which is specifically designed for skateboarding they have a non-slip tongue and for all of these make sure you go down a half size from your true size and the last sneaker we're going to talk about is perhaps the most iconic Adidas shoe of all time and that is the Adidas Superstars they were popularized by hip-hop icons in the 80s and 90s and just like the campus these were originally designed for basketball but then they transitioned to more of a lifestyle shoe and even though the Superstar name is pretty popular these have an almost equally popular nickname they're commonly known as the Shell Toes and that is because of this iconic rubber shell toe cap that these shoes have they're definitely the chunkiest of all the sneakers mentioned in this video however I don't really consider this as a chunky shoe it's still a pretty low profile sneaker and for sizing on these for me these actually fit perfectly at true to size which for me is a size 11. they're typically made out of leather you really can't go wrong with owning a pair of these and absolutely Timeless shoe and they pretty much go with anything they're just very easy to wear just an all-time classic sneaker so once again just to recap on the sizing so whatever your true size is in most shoes go a half size up from your true size for the Adidas sambas you want to go down half a size for both the gazelles and the campus and and finally with the Adidas Superstars stick with your true size I didn't cover all of the Adidas sneakers in this video there are definitely some other pretty similar looking shoes but they're still pretty popular such as the Adidas spezials and you also have the Adidas Forum low for sizing on the Forum lows by the way you can go with true to size on those too both of those are great options as well but let me know down in the comments what is your favorite classic Adidas shoe I hope that you found this video useful once again make sure you hit that like button if you did it really does help out the channel the links to all my socials as well as my sneaker podcast those can be found in the description thank you guys so much for watching this video I'll catch you guys in the next one peace foreign,2025-06-23 14:39:01.692913 UTC

favorite shoes that I own there's also a newer version of the gazelle that just got released called the gazelle bold which actually features a triple stacked outsole a very interesting shoe for all of these gazelle models like I said you want to be going down half a size from your true size to get the best fit very quickly if you've been finding this video useful so far make sure you hit that like button it really does help me out and helps push this video to a wider audience and if this is your first time on the channel my name is Josh I'm dropping sneaker content at least three videos a week so make sure you hit that subscribe button to stay up to date the next sneaker we're going to talk about is the Adidas campus a basketball sneaker from the 80s and it's a bit of an underrated shoe it doesn't get as much much love as the sambas and the gazelles but it's still pretty popular and although the difference is quite subtle these are in fact chunkier than the previous two shoes these also have more padding on the tongue they're almost like a skateboarding shoe type of tongue and materials wise these are typically made out of nubuck not this particular version this is the collaboration with South Park so it's made out of this towel like material but normally they're made out of nubuck for sizing on this pair they fit the same as the gazelles so for me that is a half size down than my true size and just like all the Adidas shoes these also come in many different versions the most popular being the campus 80s which is just like the pair you see right here you also have the campus 2000s which are normally made out of suede and have thicker Adidas Stripes as well as thicker laces and finally there's also the campus ADV which is specifically designed for skateboarding they have a non-slip tongue and for all of these make sure you go down a half size from your true size and the last sneaker we're going to talk about is perhaps the most iconic Adidas shoe of all time and that is the Adidas Superstars they were popularized by hip-hop icons in the 80s and 90s and just like the campus these were originally designed for basketball but then they transitioned to more of a lifestyle shoe and even though the Superstar name is pretty popular these have an almost equally popular nickname they're commonly known as the Shell Toes and that is because of this iconic rubber shell toe cap that these shoes have they're definitely the chunkiest of all the sneakers mentioned in this video however I don't really consider this as a chunky shoe it's still a pretty low profile sneaker and for sizing on these for me these actually fit perfectly at true to size which for me is a size 11. they're typically made out of leather you really can't go wrong with owning a pair of these and absolutely Timeless shoe and they pretty much go with anything they're just very easy to wear just an all-time classic sneaker so once again just to recap on the sizing so whatever your true size is in most shoes go a half size up from your true size for the Adidas sambas you want to go down half a size for both the gazelles and the campus and and finally with the Adidas Superstars stick with your true size I didn't cover all of the Adidas sneakers in this video there are definitely some other pretty similar looking shoes but they're still pretty popular such as the Adidas spezials and you also have the Adidas Forum low for sizing on the Forum lows by the way you can go with true to size on those too both of those are great options as well but let me know down in the comments what is your favorite classic Adidas shoe I hope that you found this video useful once again make sure you hit that like button if you did it really does help out the channel the links to all my socials as well as my sneaker podcast those can be found in the description thank you guys so much for watching this video I'll catch you guys in the next one peace foreign,2025-06-23 14:39:01.692913 UTC

gI6phQHrSwk,Reebok Club C 85 Vintage shoes,speed is pretty good so i just drove into this empty parking lot which is a church and there was a car doing like donuts over there i didn't think anything of it and i passed them and then they stopped and now they just very slowly pulled behind my car the reebok club c85s in cream not white people say i like your nice white shoes and i'm like try again you buffoon these are cream so hi real quick if you follow me you probably know that i'm usually into like stuff that lasts forever boots and jackets and all that stuff but that's not all there is to me baby so i have two rules well maybe just one a rule that i try to live by to not get set in my ways and get boring or whatever it may be is if you have a disposable product that there's a lot of different versions of you should uh even if you like the version unless you're obsessed with it you should always try something new so the reebok club c85s are my second white shoe ever after my adidas stan smiths which i trashed those i wore those for seven years there were holes on the bottom so i didn't get new white shoes i just stopped wearing them when it was raining outside i'll do a stan smith's video separately so definitely subscribe and follow me on instagram and comment on this video and like it anyways though i want to split this review up into three parts one of them them's gonna be with this guy there's times where i wish i knew more about how to attack someone i think if i turn this way in the video i may be going gray today i'm changing my style so that's what this guy is for i tell people if i'm ever in a fight i'm just gonna try and go the nuts route like if i'm inside and there's a light bulb next to me i'm just gonna grab the light bulb and crush it and be like oh really but i'm not near any light bulbs so i really have no other plan in this specific style this modern style i love and for some reason i just never did it it could be because i was actually permanently banned from r male fashion advice on reddit i'll make a video about that separately because i want to wage war i've never done anything wrong in my life but anyways today i am redoing my entire fashion sense or i guess i'm just getting one outfit that isn't raw denim pants and a raw denim jacket and blunt stones anyways though redoing my style talking about the shoe obviously and then there's one main thing i really don't like i might not like it i don't know we'll talk about that last anyways here we go what are they doing what are you oh okay the reebok club c85s every brand has a white shoe because a white shoe is it adds contrast to basically any pair of pants you have besides white pants but if you're wearing white pants you're probably making a statement anyways that's why i had to redirect from the path and get the cream shoe the more refined subtle hint of i'm not like everybody else i like cream i like cream and my tea looking at the shoe itself obviously i haven't had these for years so i read a lot of reviews and heard what people thought basically the view on reebok is that they're an awesome company that makes high quality shoes for a good price in terms of materials nothing here is crazy you have a sneaker that i think costs 70 bucks with no discounts or anything and it's discounted a lot you have a rubber outsole it is stitched on to the upper probably also glued one thing i do always look for on sneakers is stitching just because if you look at converts that aren't stitched for example when you walk that corner kind of where your toe is it always pops off because the glue wears out or whatever adhesion they use wears out and i just hate that look so in terms of leather quality these are chrome tanned which rose anvil who cut shoes in half all the time any time he sees chrome tanned he seems to hate it but from tan is just a cheaper faster way of tanning leather technically it is not as environmentally friendly as vegetable tanning but it's kind of the world we live in if these were vegetable tanned they would probably cost double this or maybe more the way that you can tell though is that there's a raw self edge of leather basically everywhere where the stitches are which is honestly totally fine it would be weird if the leather was stitched down or rolled or anything like that it'd probably be a weird looking design but you can see that there's a very slight blue hint to it which signifies chrome tan usually unless vegetable tan was getting crazy and some dye fell in there if i had to guess we're totally fine because one it is 2 p.m in the afternoon on a sunday and we're at church so if anything if they were going to come attack me i'm pretty sure god would come down and slice the end goal is to transform myself into someone that you see and you say holy crap that guy looks so relaxed and basically the look that i'm after that a lot of my friends do a lot of people online do is just sweat an oversized kind of cool sweatshirt and then white shoes the goal i'm getting an oversized cape cod sweatshirt today the annoying part about all this is that i can't stand flimsy sweatshirts they drive me nuts i like very thick sweatshirts anything under 12 ounces i'm like get this off of my body they're not my favorite representation of where i'm from but the black dog is the company that i found that makes the heaviest sweatshirts i put my fingers between the sweatshirts and i rub them together and i'm like that feels like a six ounce garment wash like most white sneakers this isn't crazy incredibly high quality leather or anything like that so there is a surface of paint or shine i forget what it's called i'll put it right here plastic there is a surface of that over the leather which gives it that cream or white look and as that scuffs you'll probably start to see the kind of gross color of worn cheap leather like this which again should be expected and in terms of shoes like common projects or something like that 400 white sneakers i've never seen the value in those those age better of course you would hope that they would and now if we look at the side of the shoes you'll see that they're stitching everywhere but this doesn't look like it's different pieces of leather all stitched together at different areas obviously there are different areas of leather but there's also some stitching i think is just used for decoration to give it its look and it looks quite nice there is one part that's not leather i don't know why they did that maybe to give it a different look but if you look right under the ankle there's a little bit of fabric that is rolled so i don't know why they did that maybe they were just like hey you know would be fun i don't think it's to save on cost or anything though i think they were just the designers were getting funky with it the tongue of it looks interesting in the fact that it is more cream than the actual shoe i would say the shoe is like a orthopedic gray i don't know why we'll get into that in a little bit but i would say it's an orthopedic gray but the tongue is truly cream i don't know why that is i hope you can see it on the video but basically you know the trend that's happening right now is that all these companies are kind of reverting back to the 70s 80s 90s people like oversized sweatshirts and different looks and this generation really grabs any generation of style they want but the club c85 is kind of a classic shoe anyway so they never really had to change it but the design on it isn't updated and that's a big plus when we look at the inside of the shoe it's very nice i can see my toe prints i doubt yours will have those but it looks nice it is kind of also raw on the inside things are just stitched they're not folded over doesn't look like they emphasize being super clean which again to me isn't a big deal and then you won't believe it but i found something better than the black dog again black dog makes great stuff but it's just i don't like that aesthetic it's very it's very much the kids that would pick on you in high school wore the black dog anyways though score of a lifetime it turns out this store called soft as a grape has um which my mom actually suggested i go to they have champion hoodies reverse weave which is champion's best sweat material and they have it with cape cod on it breaking news i don't know if i'm going to be able to make it to the field in time because the sun sets at like 1am in the winter the inside is french terry cloth which is ooh i don't know the specific reason to do that french terry cloth aka towel maybe it helps sweat obviously with new sneaker technology it really doesn't matter maybe when these first came out that helped a lot with sweat a picture of towel that you dry yourself off with in those little loops that come out of the towel drink those by like two times i actually didn't even notice that's what it was until i read it online and then i was like oh look at that it is fred's terry cloth did a little run trial of them i can run basically the same speed as i could my stan smith they don't make me go any faster jump height about the same depends on how much i ate that day i noticed is more of a factor than the shoes i found a different field that i will use instead because i'm getting scared it's going to be too dark and also this is probably very bright for the amount of times i've changed in a car you think they'd be for cool reasons or like fun like young youthful reasons they're actually mostly all for videos what is with people driving by me slowly and staring at me oh this feels great bear with me i know you can't see the outfit we're actually gonna do it in two steps one i'm gonna keep the jeans on to the out i say outfit like it's really special the big news is i bought a cape cod sweater thrilled about it but two steps so here we go two things the more i look at this outfit the more i realize it's it's very simple it's just light wash jeans and a gray crew neck with white shoes but i like it and i feel much more stylish than i have been in a while so you need any fashion tips give me a call this is basically just something that people in the 90s wore okay now the the ultimate thing end goal that i wanted which is really simple but it's a big deal for a few reasons the thing that i don't like which again i don't know if i don't like it or not i hinted at it i gave you a little teaser before i have this issue where i need to realize that i basically you essentially have two pairs of shoes you have the pair of shoes when you put them on and you look down and you say that's what my shoes look like and then you have the pair of shoes where everybody else sees them from the side angle and they say oh that's what your shoes look like i think from the side these shoes look great young hip when i look down though i see these these like orthopedic old shoes and i just can't get over that especially because like i said before the color of the shoes is an orthopedic gray and my worst fear is someone runs up right next to me and they go like shoulder to shoulder and they look directly down at my shoes and like are you wearing grandpa's shoes my hair is greying but these are young man shoes and honestly maybe it's just a change in style because as i wore them and walked around with them to film i was kind of like oh these are cool these are cool any way you look at them and i'm sure as they break in and loosen a little bit they're gonna look cooler and cooler would i get these over stan smith's again no because i will probably never get either of those shoes again unless it's for a youtube video because there's plenty other white shoes for me to try it's very simple it's actually painfully simple it's just sweatpants but for some reason i have this mental block about sweatpants where if i put them on i feel like people will think i'm lazy or gross or something but it's very much accepted now that wearing sweatpants as long as you look like you put some tiny bit of effort into your outfit it's pretty much accepted that sweatpants are a fashion statement now i had the toughest time doing that i wore sweats yesterday all day like the first time just as an outfit and what happened was there is this moment where i spilled crumbs of something on my sweatpants and i was just like oh i just look so sloppy and i look like i didn't try today but it's not true i did try i even i was sat on my bed and i was like oh i don't know maybe i'll put on my jeep maybe i'll put on a full suit instead i want to vary up all my looks i want to be well versed so now i'm in a full sweatsuit and i'm feeling good i feel like i'm in my pajamas but also at the same time i feel like a fashionista people that are watching this video are probably like this put on sweatpants and expects me to clap for him wait wait as always i always forget to review this part size i always forget to talk about size i went true to size with these eight and a half i could do a nine i could also do an eight a nine would be a little too big eight would be a little too small so i guess i can't do that eight and a half i typically wear an eight and a half i think my stan smiths are an eight i will put it right here look look at this number that's what my stan smiths are i don't know why i always forget the most important part of the video and i also don't tie them and they fit well they don't fall off when i went this size eight and a half anyways though that's about it grandpa has to go take his vitamins now so his gray hairs don't get any longer i can't lie the level of comfort i feel even versus like my broken in washed jeans it's pretty ridiculous all right i feel very trendy right now and i like it feels really good me,2025-06-19 08:38:05.552649 UTC

Kj61tXBq2VQ,Nike Air Max 90,"talking about seeing things as they play out we've now got official images official images of the PA Nike Air Max 90s that are due to come out at the end of this month I'm sure [ __ ] fire Number one you have to trust PA when it comes to Air Maxes in general because apart from London I think the best scene when it comes to sneaker collecting it has to be Amsterdam In my personal opinion I don't think America kind of counts because those [ __ ] are only obsessed with like Jordans and [ __ ] But when it comes to the love and the appreciation for Air Maxes for vintage runners for cross trainers um everything else in between even the popular the popularization sorry of um AS6 and stuff like Mizunos I feel like came from Amsterdam I'm not going to lie If you know you know when it comes to that whole thing But I feel as if like especially the Pat crew they were very important in like the resurgence of those type of brands and making them a thing again I swear to God they played a huge role in the same way that I think at the time when Crooked Tong was around and London was popping I think we played a huge role in that kind of the re you know the re the resurgence of New Balance the Flimy [ __ ] factory and [ __ ] All of that kind of happened from London But I think when it comes to Air Max I definitely think of Amsterdam because I think they they know what's up So I've always been very you know clear that the Nike MX90 is probably my favorite Nike Air Max model of all time because it was obviously designed by legendary designer Tinker Highfield 2 But in terms of a silhouette I prefer the Air Max90 to Air Max 1 I'm not sure why Maybe because it's one of my favorite one of my first sort of Nikes I ever wore cuz I got given like a secondhand pair beat up that my friend used to wear for football But back then you know we didn't have any money so I was just desperate to because I think now if I looked at them they'll be horrible But I think at the time I was like ""No I can still make these work."" I remember my friend had a pair of all black MX90s big up Brian Um and they had a silver swoosh a silver foil swoosh on the side Um completely all black And obviously you could wear them for school which I did but I remember having those I remember wearing them so much I ended up kind of customizing them where I removed the swoosh on the side and then replaced the swoosh with like a camo swoosh which is what everyone did you know Um but I think on one pair I tried to unstitch the swoosh another on another pair I tried to super glue it over it It didn't turn out that great but you know again still [ __ ] love the shoes Um and of course some of the vintage colorways from back in the day So good man the infrareds the um there's a peach there's a coral colorway that I'm a bit obsessed with from time Many many ones out there if you kind of check out some old you know line sheets or whatever maybe when it comes to Nike But damn this particular pair from PA is just sensational That wavy mud guard thing going on I saw a girl the other day wearing a pair of Air Maxes Air Max ones that happened with that wavy thing and how people forget how much of a moment that was But this is equally a big moment because number one the colorway is [ __ ] fire This vault green lime green What's the actual official name for it The official name for the color way is I don't really have the the colorway name But I think I think it might be like a neon No cyber That's it There's a cyber one and the other colorway is sapphire I think or something But this cyber colorway this cyber green is just too good I like that they use this different mesh on the toe box and the back I forgot the name of it but it's a different mesh from what you usually get with Air Max 90s if I'm not mistaken The side mud guard with the wavy pattern is [ __ ] awesome I also love this little detail because you never usually see the swoosh underneath that mud guard But when I was younger I'm not going to lie I didn't think the swoosh was that thin I thought the swoosh just extended down here you know I didn't think they actually kind of clipped it and kind of made it look like a swoosh but you couldn't see it because that is usually covered by a mud guard That's a crazy attention to detail that no one will notice because most of it or you know some of it it's covered up by that mud guard But at least you let this one hang and you can see it stitches And then on the back here where it usually says Air Max again on the side they've got this really interesting weird little PA sort of like hologram thing going on which is sick Um my only pet peeve would be that you know how they're doing this reimagined Air Max 95s and [ __ ] I think I would really like to see or like to to see an Air Max 90 with a big bubble with the kind of bubble that originally they came with when you know Ting Hatfield first sketched them out or at the very least a bubble that's a bit slightly bigger than what we have here or maybe even to go further maybe just stripping away some of this paint especially on the inside of the bubble so it kind of makes them look a bit more vintage cuz that's what I think they used to do on the old runners back in the day or the old MX90 vintage ones anyway that inside kind of ridge on the bubble would be completely white So it make the kind of bubble pop more But I would love it if they just increase the size of the bubble to pay homage to the kind of original sketches But regardless of that it's [ __ ] beautiful You got this white off-white midsole thing going on You've got this black uh mud guard thing You've got the swoosh which is made in silver metallic silver It looks like um the main body is kind of like a grayish colorway It kind of looks white from afar but it's not It's actually gray Um it kind I think so Um I'm not sure if this is New Buck with the body but still beautiful And then you got these kind of like off-white ivory laces as well and a black tongue But they are so [ __ ] hard Legitimately one of the best sneakers I've seen in a while And I'll be trying my bestest to try and cop them By the way like I said like it's so mad cuz you never see this on the side of Actually you know what I actually wouldn't mind seeing that Thinking about it now cuz you never see the swoosh on the MX90 because it's always covered by the mud guard I wonder if somebody's ever going to do a collaboration where they completely remove the mud guard so you completely can see the swish just hanging there on in the air by itself you know with no [ __ ] love That'd be kind of great to see I'm not going to lie I'd love that But yeah this wave mud guard thing is [ __ ] awesome It looks so [ __ ] cool Um again let's see some more pictures of the other colorway I think coming up Oh look how you can tell a sneaker's hard when you can when you can come and you can get hard based on how they look from the top down Look at that toe box man Look at the shape of that toe box Look how spelt it is as well The shape from the front to the back Like these look already comfortable I love the massive patter logo on the tongue as well there That's a really nice [ __ ] touch I'm not going to lie That's a really [ __ ] nice touch Like this is a collaboration It's a special collab you probably won't be able to get anywhere else So big up them And what's that tongue made out of Is that a suede or newuk tongue Interesting Not seen that in a while And I think that's a nylon ice ain't it Huh interesting material choices Um and of course the back which you can't go wrong in I want to wear these for carnival or something man or a festival cuz they look so [ __ ] hard They'll get obviously battered but Jesus Christ so good The bottom of the shoe outsole And then you got the blue pair I think these are called sapphire So same makeup not the cyber but the sapphire I love that they keep it simple And if I'm not mistaken is that gray the same The actual body I think I think it's the same color It's just swapped the sapphire for the cyber But I take both And and if I'm not mistaken that midsole also looks like it's been stained in it I actually stained to make it look a bit more vintage which I which I don't mind as well I think it looks hard But I think both colorways pop Maybe the silver swoosh pops more on the sapphire colorway than the cyers but I would still be happy with either pair I'm not going to lie Absolutely beautiful beautiful beautiful [ __ ] shoe Big up patter Um and I also wanted to check out a video regarding the launch for it A little promo video that PA put together So let's check out this promo video courtesy of PATA Let's see what they're talking about here Yeah I want to control you want to involve bouncing as a wave to the function How many creps How many steps got on the air max a since I was a baby I'm getting money I'm a fly young lady in my mention stand Jesus Christ she's [ __ ] hard is it she's [ __ ] hard she's [ __ ] hard god damn Pat the bread one step ahead Blow a kiss to your head on a ball like fold See the way I fold them I'm only getting bigger You can check the figure I want my brother with my bro Yeah that's my [ __ ] heavy off the dr And we walk every round All my enemies are pissed Everyone that's on my wrist Super estate Hopping out a dinger to a plate I was in the end trying to escape Now I'm cash so good So [ __ ] good So uh big up Benex big up Binks as well Absolutely sick sick sick collaboration The tracksuit is [ __ ] hard I love that they use that old logo that old tag man If you know you know about that old Nike Air Max tag I was talking to someone actually about the other day about all the best Nike gear It's from that Nike tennis apparel collection where it's got that kind of tennis um court symbol on it If you know you know about that [ __ ] collection or about that range anyway But this is some great Nike sportsware bits So the tracksuit that matches the trainers They're wearing it here with this artist I wish I I can't pronounce his name What's his name again Odu Odam Odamodu Odamodu block or Odu Black I think Oda Black I think Um but he's I think an Afrobe artist So he's also wearing it He looks [ __ ] sick in it There's a matching t-shirt The t-shirt maybe is a bit too much for me with the big logo on the back Nike team patter thing is a little bit cringe but the rest of it is [ __ ] great The tracksuit is so [ __ ] well done Especially this one That that cyber one is me That cyber tracksuit is me Such a hard [ __ ] look Obviously had to reace the shoes I don't like how he's wearing them But this cyber tracksuit is [ __ ] hard It reminds you of a trackuit you would have got back in the day in Foot Locker The one that would be in the window The one that would be like [ __ ] £120 or something for just a jacket That's what that kind of looks like So that it looks [ __ ] hard Um so the blur says the apparel with Nike collaboration will be available exclusively on the mobile app on Wednesday the 18th So it's already dropped Um if you want to get the tracksuit or t-shirt with the sneakers everything will launch on Friday 20th on PA at Nike PAXnike.com Um our mobile app as well as the PA chapter stores in Amsterdam London Milan and Lagos A limited edition Stick They've got they got a store in Lagos I didn't know that Big up

win-win where I'm from also uncivilized store.com buckets who is behind the camera and myself we have a clothing brand uncivilized store.com is where we sell said clothing we got a bunch of cool stuff on the website right now but quantities are limited so you can check that out we throw a link in the description of this video with that said all the formalities out of the way buckets how you feeling I feel good we diving in or what sure 3 21 bang bang this is the Bad Bunny Adidas gazelle indoor San one [Applause] these released at the end of June so a couple of weeks ago and Retail was 140 bucks they did sell out shouts to the good people over at kicks R4 us a local resale shop down here in the Tampa area they tossed me this pair for a review sadly they are not my size so I could not buy them I'm still on the hunt but I'm trying to be patient because in my size they're going for like 400 bucks so I'm on the lookout but wanted to get my hands on a pair and take a look at them in person I got to say right out of the box I absolutely love them definitely my new favorite Adidas sneaker I think it's the best bunny shoe to date and I don't even think that's really a hot take it shouldn't be a hot take anyway I love the colorway I really like the materials they used and I'm not even really a gazelle guy per se but I really like these buckets how you feeling them I like them how much I'll let you know at the end buckets plays it close to the vest now buckets we've talked about we've talked about this previously I should say in regard to collaborations the sign of like a real Banger of a collaboration is when it makes someone who's not into that silhouette or into that particular sneaker model be more into it you know we saw that with uh what Ronnie F did with the A6 gel light 3 I think we saw it more recently with Joe freshh goods and what he did with the New Balance 960 maybe the gazelle doesn't fit into that category because it's more widely known than those other sneakers yeah but for me it did that yeah you could say that the gazelle is more widely classic but the jelli 3 I was going to say the jelly 3 is really classic in its own right yeah I don't know what I'm trying to say but hopefully hopefully you get it hopefully it makes a little bit of sense I wasn't a gazelle guy and now maybe I don't know maybe I'm becoming a gazelle guy is what I'm trying to say I'm not trying to overhype these I just really dig them I'm also not really a Bad Bunny fan I just think the sneaker is cool you've got that Carolina blue obviously has a really nice pop to it and then the different materials they used really help to break the sneaker up a bit you've got this sort of nylon around the ankle a lired suede on the front and back of the sneaker there's also this cream long-haired suede running along the lace Loops here you've got white leather Adidas stripes on the side a super smooth blue suede on the rest of the sneaker really really nice to the touch Adidas San Juan in gold as you can see San Juan being the inspo behind the sneaker or colorway I should say the blue cobblestone streets in San Juan specifically the beaches the sky Puerto Rico So Bad Bunny obviously paying homage to where he's from a few more details you've got the size tag on the heel off-white Vibes double leather tongue with some Adidas branding right here again you see this sort of off-white feel with the tongue stitching real rope laces another nice touch white ankle liner blue insoles and there is also an extra set of thicker insoles gum midsole which I love and some more Adidas branding and the all gum bottom which I mean come on it doesn't get more classic than that I really dig how you can see the Stripes Under the midsole by the way how it's kind of semi-translucent and how the Adidas stripe goes over over the long-haired suede here I just think it's layered very nicely and they even used this canvas trim at the bottom kind of separating the upper and the midsole I should also mention these come with a bag in the box I almost forgot it has kind of like a recycled feel to it although I'm not sure if it actually is recycled but it's always nice to get extra stuff I don't know man these are just really really well done in my opinion like I said the materials colorway the little details I think these are a dope Vibe especially in the summertime now I know the gazelle is not for everybody like I said I was not really a big gazelle guy technically still not a big gazelle guy it's a soccer shoe doesn't always fit the function way but I am definitely into this pair I'm giving them buckets I'm giving these a 9.5 out of 10 feel like that's a good score I I don't know 10 n I'm going I'm going to split the difference 9.5 out of 10 and really to be honest I haven't been into many a the sneakers lately the Anthony Edwards buckets we both love those yeah those are awesome absolute Banger the sambas the gazel those are definitely making a Resurgence but like I said I don't normally have either of those in the rotation maybe I'm late to the party I don't know definitely going to check out some other colorways because as much as I like these now I'm kind of you know now I'm on the prow a little bit so 9 and a half out of 10 for me Buckets what are you giving them I'm going to go eight eight out of 10 yeah okay you're feeling them again you're not really a gazelle guy I'm not a gazelle guy I'm not a Samba guy I know that they're insanely popular like overall yeah so I don't know maybe we're idiots maybe we're way late to the party I think that we are late to the party but I still am not a huge Samba guy and I'm still not a huge gazelle guy all right you're standing on business yeah I'm still late to the party like I have not arrived to the party yet okay but you're proud about being late to the party fashionably late intended I don't know double Onan don't even ask me how I just think that it's okay to not like something oh for sure I don't even know if I didn't like them I just never really gravitated towards them it's a soccer sneaker yeah for me it's the thing is I like the stand Smith I like a lot of different types of sneakers and when I say it's okay not to like something I'm I don't hate these one thing I will say no I don't hate them either one thing I will say is that typically I feel like gazelle's I wear a size 13 bucket you also wear a size 133 I feel like the gazelle in the bigger sizes can look a little bit canish like it's a little bit of a long silhouette a long sneaker these have a bit of a wider cut I think because of that sturdy double tongue so it kind of they're not as long and narrow as what I remember gazel looking like in the bigger sizes okay I don't know what I'm talking about anymore uh anything to add anything to hopefully they understood what we were trying to say yeah I don't know this is thank you for coming to my TED Talk uh of sorts uh leave a comment below let us know how do you feel about these this collaboration Bad Bunny collaborations in general the gazelle the samba I feel like those two kind of go hand inand they're very similar I don't know maybe that makes I've mixed them up a couple times at different points in the past I'm not ashamed to admit it um I know they are different sneaker models obviously and I know I'm coming off what's the word I'm looking for like a uh like a sneaker novice right now but that's okay I was going to say un succinct un succinct what does that mean succinct means uh like clear and to the point direct

5wN7QQAAXxw,on cloudmonster 2,that that's it you say stuff that's it no every time we say stuff what do you want to say take on oncloud Monster 2 take one all right so we're talking about one of the most popular Styles shoes that is making some pretty nice running shoes from Switzerland designed Switzerland on and I think they're dropping the running because they also have tennis now and other sports so on they had they got the Instagram handle o n at o n like they nailed that do how much do you think that cost something like a two-letter Instagram handle it's pretty nice all right so let's get into the shoe the previous model we liked a lot it was one of the first on running shoes that we were like okay they've kind of taken the speedboard away from the the foot softened up some of the helon foam on it and it made it a really nice shoe we both liked it Robbie liked it as a matter of fact you didn't have an opinion on it did you no cuz I didn't have the shoe yeah so Robbie and I both liked it quite a bit our big complaint was the upper wasn't very structured so that it wasn't giving you that great fit that you want in a running shoe without a spoiler they've updated the upper but is it better we'll find out in a second here especially when we're talking about the difference between our two feet all right well let's get into it so first of all Aesthetics wise I mean an's nailing it per usual this looks amazing the upper is just a nice mesh here uh you've got a gusted tongue it's very thin very minimal um the laces are pretty simple they lock the foot down just fine but the it's really the I think what Thomas is struggling with here is the the width of this shoe and just how much room there is in the forefoot which as someone with a wider foot I absolutely love however I will say I think it runs about a half size too large so while there is a ton of room in here for your toes display maybe a little bit too much yeah this this upper I was really hoping that the upper was going to be a big update on this shoe because I really like the way that the midsole had a great sensation underf fooot in the previous model but with the baggie upper I couldn't really get a good tight lock down and while this has a new mesh upper that looks a little bit more traditional like a running shoe there's not those forms that are in here those overlays or underlays or taping or anything that kind of lock your foot in really nice so for me with a narrow foot I really had to cinch this up as tight as I could and even when I did that there is still room in for my foot to slide around there's definitely room in the toe box I also had some little bit of slipping and extra room in the collar of the shoe and the heel counter it runs about a half size too big that could play into the baggy oversized feeling that I'm getting in this shoe but I will say that was a little bit of a disappointment for me that there wasn't like maybe just a little bit more structure uh if you look at like the eclipse the eclipse has a nice fitting upper I felt like they did a nice job wasn't perfect they still run a little bit more on the roomy side than the narrow side but this one definitely I really would have liked to have a little more structure in the upper to lock that foot down and I do wonder if it would have been a very different experience if we did have that half size down where there isn't quite so much room for your foot to move around so TBD on that one but definitely go half size down if you are going to get this one yeah and Robbie normally wears a seven and a half he's actually started going down to like a seven in his running shoes they sent him a 7even and A2 and he felt like it was almost a full size too big he had so much room in it that he wasn't able to run it and actually pass it off to uh one of our writers that does some of the written reviews so we'll get that opinion from him but for me I think a half siiz down would make a difference but let's move down to the mids soulle M all right so this is where another big update comes into play here so you've got the helon foam which we're all used to from on and that's primarily throughout the shoe but then in the forfoot here you'll see there is a it's a new layer of this compressed teon foam and so what that does is it gives it a little bit more of a Snappy ride it also feels a little smidge softer on step in I think than the original Monster which I did put on my feet I just didn't run in it um but what do you think overall I don't know if we're getting spoiled by a lot of soft soft Foams this has a firmer feel this certainly feels firmer than the eclipse so if you're looking for something that isn't like mushy that still has a nice bit of give nice bit of cushion but is going to feel a little firmer Under Foot this really delivers yeah so the oncloud Eclipse which we loved um is definitely going to be the softer version of a shoe like this this has that traditional speed board that you know from on it is a nylon um plate in there it has been reworked a little bit in this one versus the original um to give you a little bit more of that Poppy ride but it is going to be a firmer ride when you're comparing it to something like the oncloud eclipse where it's just really had a shank in the center of it rather than the full speed board yeah with the Dual density I'm getting a different feel under the foot especially under the front of the foot it does have a nice roll through it I don't know I wouldn't call this a rocker but it does have a really nice transition from Heel To Toe yeah when we were talking about this shoe earlier I I've been lacing it up for a lot of my runs I just I feel like it's a shoe that I like and I'm gravitating towards and it was hard for me to explain why because there isn't any significant sensation Under Foot you don't feel like this crazy pop from a plate or like crazy reaction from the but it just Cloud Tech I think it feels good and it's it's slightly firmer than I think some of the softer shoes I've been running in and maybe that's a nice change up um but yeah it's just a generally like a nice ride all right and today I did my miles it was snowing SL raining and I was a little nervous cuz we run over all types of uh surfaces including wood decking which is normally if I'm going to slip that's where it's going to be this rubber on the out soole seemed to do fine I didn't have any slipping there is some exposed areas of the foam the helon here but overall traction was pretty good what do you think yeah I had no issues um with traction I was also out there running this morning in the snow and rain which was super fun um but yeah I think I think you'll you'll be pretty good with this and I feel like it's definitely going to get some miles out of it I already have over 30 miles on the shoe and you can't even see anywhere on the bottom here yeah we didn't go over the the drop the drop is 6 mm from Heel To Toe so not nothing it's not extreme in either direction it's not low Drop it's not high drop it's right there in the middle so that's pretty much the shoe we didn't get into the weight yeah so it's definitely I mean look at it it's it's a monster so it's a little bit on the heavier side um we weighed mine but it's wet from the run this morning and it was like 8.8 o for my women's 7 and A2 according to the spec sheet a women size 7even comes in at 8.1 o so I'm thinking my 7 and half is somewhere between those two mine's a little wet too so I'm not going to give you the exact number but it's over 11 for this one their spec she says amends basically 8 and 1/2 weighs 300 G or 10.6 o so you can guess that a 10 and a half is definitely going to be over 11 oz which is pretty heavy I mean but like I didn't really notice it out on the run it wasn't a shoe that I laced up that I was like man this feels heavy um maybe just cuz I wasn't expecting to run fast in this shoe I was just expecting some easy miles and so for that it didn't really bother me yeah I did notice the weight it did feel a little bit more and it might have been the fit of the upper giving me more of a clunky feeling um I wouldn't clunky is a little bit harsh it's not like terrible but I did notice the weight I was like waiting to get it on the scale till we did the review because sometimes when I notice a shoe is a little heavy I want to see if it's going to feel lighter if I don't have it in my head what the actual weight is but this one it is heavier now it retails for 180 right me y so this is going to be available we believe don't quote me if it doesn't happen but February 22nd uh $180 so right in line with a lot of the super trainers' been talking about that's that's where I think there's a problem yeah so at $180 you're putting it up there with shoes like the Endorphin speed 4 you're putting it up there which has a plate but look how good you look at okay so if you're just going for fash but you're you're going up against some Heavy Hitters that puts you up against stuff like the Boston 12 puts you up you're getting close to the super blast price there's a lot of what we call Super trainers in that 180 price point that this one I think is a really solid daily trainer but I don't know that it elevates to the same performance level as some of those other ones but if you're just going for style and looks and you want a comfortable shoe for your miles this one will handle that all right so what are you giving this me I'm giving it a yellow and it's a tough one because I really do like the shoe the monster was the first one that brought me back into it but without them really doing a nice update on the upper that really fixes some of the issues I had with the original one and this weight I can't give it a green I can't give it a big thumbs up it's just it's a good daily trainer I don't know that the this would be something that once we finish this review that I'm going to be like oh excited to put back on I think I'll move on to uh other offerings like the eclipse see I think that's where we differ here is even after the review I have a feeling I'm going to be lacing this one up um I think that's partially because of the fit of the upper wasn't as bad for me as it was for you because of my wider foot so what are you giving it I would give it a green because I think if this came in my correct size in it was a half size down I would be ecstatic over this and and much higher Praises than maybe we're giving today all right so maybe I have to put a caveat on my yellow and say maybe could edge up to light green if the sizing was a little bit on but between the sizing the weight and the fit it's got to stay yellow for me I can appreciate your green we'll just leave it at that yeah all right Meg so we're going to have this written up on the website you can check it out believe inther run.com of course the best way to stay in touch with

WjAFcVgkhf4,Adidas Samba,the Adidas Samba is known for its iconic design and popularity but getting the right fit can be a bit tricky especially with the way the sneaker is constructed first things first the sber generally runs true to size however they can feel a bit snug at first due to the leather upper don't worry they definitely stretch out and mul your feet over time in my personal experience I find sambers fit true to size for me I don't size up or down I just buy my true size however if you have wider feet you might want to go a half size up they're kind kind of narrow the extra space would help accommodate the width without compromising Comfort but remember that Breakin period's also going to help if you have wide feet I highly recommend using the official Adidas sizing charts to make sure you get the perfect fit for you which I have linked below sambers aren't cheap so it's worth double-checking the charts to save the hassle of returns especially if you're shopping online which let's be real most of us are also definitely consider the type of socks you're going to wear with your sambers thicker socks might require a bit more room so keep that in mind when choosing your size lacing techniques can massively affect the fit as well try different styles to find what feels best for you loose lacing works well for a relaxed fit or standard lacing gives you more support I have both loose lacing and standard lacing tutorials for the sambers on my channel if you need those so there you have it Adidas sambers run true to size remember Comfort is definitely key so take the time to find your perfect fit and check those size charts,2025-06-19 08:41:00.831423 UTC
1fgb7uW-l4E,Stan Smith,the Adidas Stan Smith sneaker is undoubtedly a forever classic even men who are not into style or fashion conscious know about this iconic shoe and probably have at least one pair in their sneaker rotation I've had my Stan Smiths for a bit over a year and a half now it's not an ordinary pair of Stan Smiths though it's the special edition Kermit the Frog design that dropped a little bit over a year ago and so in this comprehensive review I'm going to quickly touch on the Stan Smith history cover the style and design of the shoe quality and craftsmanship comfort and durability shoe sizing pros and cons and finally wrap it up with the price to Performance let's get started so for a quick history of the Adidas Stan Smith it goes back over 50 years and counting the shoe has its status as the very first leather tennis shoe with the most popular version of the Adidas Dan Smith being the OG Cloud white and green which debuted in 1965. originally named Adidas Robert Hill it after the brand endorsed the French tennis pro but in 1978 it was renamed named after Stan Smith an American tennis player Fresh Off winning the U.S open in 1971. now I'm not going to bore you with any more details of the history here so if you want a deeper dive on Adidas and the lore of the Stan Smiths you can go and check out the article on my blog now let's Jump Right In with the style and design of the sneaker so the Adidas Stan Smith is comprised of a white leather upper and soft cotton laces and it's a simple minimalist sneaker design the clear difference between the Stan Smith and other Adidas shoes is the lack of the three stripes angled across the shoe side instead there's three rows of these perforated ventilation holes on both sides there's sometimes a sketched picture of Stan Smith on the tongue of the shoe that says endorsed by Stan Smith with his signature in the case of my kermits the sketches prominently displayed in the same lime green color as the green on the back tab all in all the design and form of the shoe has basically stayed the same since it was a originally introduced but a myriad of new versions and colorways have appeared throughout the years so let's delve into more specifics of this special edition Kermit sneakers so my Kermit Stan Smith sneakers have an identical design to the current Stan Smith model but instead of the classic Kelly Green shade it's a much a lighter shade while I'm green almost neon green color and it's the same color as the Beloved Kermit the Frog for details you're going to find a sketch drawing of Kermit down in the right lower right hand corner of the shoe with Kermit all in caps angled in the middle of the upper between two of the perforated stripes with all of these small details it's not as minimal as a pair of plain stand Smiths but it pays homage to the equally as iconic Muppets character additional details to note are on the left shoe tongue you'll again find Kermit proudly displayed and finally the colored tab along the back of the shoe is the same lime green color but instead of the Stan Smith logo type the left shoe has printed it's not easy in quotes and the right shoe being green in quotes and it's an obvious playoff words calling out the color green and sustainability and of course the trefoil emblem is prominently displayed as well now on to the styling of the sneaker so the Adidas Stan Smith is a superb shoe to be worn casually which is no surprise since it was originally a sports shoe meant to be worn on the tennis courts with the connection to tennis the shoe naturally Vibes well with the preppy aesthetic think collared shirts or polo shirts for example here I'm rocking a super light fit for the warmer spring and summer climates with the light washed jeans heather gray PK polo shirt and round sunglasses simply put the Stan Smith's shine with simple outfits like this okay so if you want access to content that I don't share anywhere else be sure to subscribe to the Gent within newsletter where I'm going to send you a weekly dispatch on all things style self-development dating and confidence I'll have it linked down in the description so go ahead and sign up now back to the video so now let's get into the quality and craftsmanship of the Adidas Stan Smith so it's Stalin design is impeccable but it's the Adidas Stan Smith a well-built shoe let's find out leather upper so the Stan Smith's all leather upper is made with vegan alternatives to the animal derived ingredients with their Prime green which is their own proprietary high performance recycled materials so the leather is relatively soft and it's got a subtle pebbled texture when you're looking at it close up and it features a relaxed and flexible leather shoe tongue and a rounded toe box now for the lining and the insoles Adidas Stan Smith shoes they're lined with a thin half leather lining along the back of the shoe and a light synthetic fabric lining for the rest the insoles they're pretty soft cushioned and they display the Adidas and Disney logo along with the prime green lettering which likely means that the insole is made with recycled materials as opposed to synthetic like it used to be now for the outsoles shoes have a basic rubber outsole just like any other shoe around this price point nothing special like margam or anything like that the rubber is pretty grippy on all surfaces from concrete to wood flooring and it doesn't get all that doesn't get dirty all that easily too which is a plus and there's that Adidas a logo type and the trefoil leaves emblem printed along the side of the outsole and finally for the laces the laces are a soft cotton with a crisscross lacing system with plastic eyelets for added durability and now quickly the comfort and durability so how comfortable is the Adidas Stan Smith so in three words pretty damn comfy the fabric lining is just as soft as the leather lining and there's nothing inside of the shoe that causes discomfort even when wearing the shoe for long periods of time additionally I've worn them all day many times last summer when I was in Las Vegas just for fun and this year when I was traveling to Boise Idaho for a comfort friends and just casually wearing them all day so they've been holding up just fine the soles are still grippy and intact nothing's falling apart like with a pair of cheap shoes then you'd find at your department store and finally the shoes are pretty easy to clean you know you can simply use one of those Lysol wipes or a wet towel mix it with a dash of soap and you'll be good to go alternatively you can get those disposable shoe cleaner wipes for white leather suede or mesh from rejuvenator or simple shine you know they're convenient to use when you're in a pinch now onto the shoe sizing so I usually get size 8 sneakers for most brands and it's a pretty safe bet though there's always a small gap of excess room behind the ankle and so since Adidas offers half sizes I decided to go for seven and a half which usually fits me well too at seven and a half it's a perfect fit for me when I go either cyclists or I'm wearing thin no-show socks but with thicker wool socks for winter becomes slightly snug though not to the point that it's uncomfortable they do not offer wider sizes and so it could be a problem area for those with wider than normal feet my feet are normal though narrower shoes like The Kill Shot twos worn for lengthy periods of time can cause me a bit of discomfort these Stan Smiths however are comfortable worn all day they fit me normally like my Nike internationalists Nike Air Max and shoes from other well-known Brands like grates coyo Oliver Cabell evasia and Beckett seminar now let's get on to the price to Performance so in the current economic environment a pair of data Stan Smith retails on our website for under a hundred dollars at about 95 as of the moment the classic white cloud green colorway is on sale for 67 which is a price that you can find it at at various points throughout the year at the 67 price point this all leather sustainable sneaker is more than half the cost of some other entry to mid-level sneakers like the direct consumer favorite Becca Simon read which retails for 159 and it's more than three times cheaper than a pair of Oliver Cabello ones which are currently on sale for 1.99 they're even a good deal less expensive than affordable Thursday Premier low top sneakers which clocks in at about 129 and finally it retails about the same as the Wally popular Knight kill shot twos sold out on Nike's website again which is currently available on Amazon for 79 which is still more than the Stan Smith which is currently going for 67 on Amazon as well and so with a comfortable step a quality builds and a highly affordable price point this iconic sneaker punches well above its weight while graded on price to Performance so are the Adidas Stan Smith sustainable that's a commonly asked question so you've got to commend them Adidas they've been working towards making their shoes particularly the Stan Smiths with more sustainable materials today the Stan Smith is made with vegan alternatives to the animal derived ingredients or materials and is also made with that Prime Green Technology that I mentioned before which is a series of high performance recycled materials and the upper is made with 50 recycled content with no virgin polyester by 2024 Adidas said that they're committed to use only recycled polyester in all of their shoes which you know it's a great statement but let's hold them to it now some of the pros and cons of the sneakers so the Adidas Sam Smith is a renowned sneaker that is culturally relevant as it is the style icon it's available in over 30 colors on the Adidas website for ultimate versatility it's got a sharp and stylish silhouette it's sustainably made with an affordable price point and it's always in stock fill up what to purchase on their website and Amazon and now some of the cons you'll be following the crowd by wearing the sneaker and the special edition drops like this one sell out really fast and it can be hard to find in the resale Market alright so I've been wanting to put out this review together for a while now and it's always fun to write about products that have permeated the Fashions like Zeitgeist and our rooted in sports history like like kill shots and so you can check out another sneaker review right here or another video right here and so that's all I got for this one cheers to your style and I will catch you on the next one peace,2025-06-19 08:39:25.099616 UTC
4jmB-BNBeFU,Adidas Samba,the Adidas sambas have been everywhere for the last few years and guys I tried to hide from them I tried to escape them but I finally caved and I got two colors so let's talk about it if you're new here hi my name is Angela and I'm so happy that you clicked on this video if you love anything passion and lifestyle go ahead and subscribe to this channel I really hope you enjoyed today's video and let's jump right into it so there's a lot that I want to cover in this video about the Adidas sambus but first I just wanted to start off with showing you guys the shoes I have both colors this is the white one this is kind of a 360 view of the shoe if you haven't already seen it in person and this is the black one now this is them side by side and I do want to note that these are the samba ogs so there are different types of sambas on the website but these are the ogs so these are made out of leather and suede now I want to talk a little bit about the quality of the shoe and I must say that I was actually really impressed by the quality of the samp was so I personally do not have a lot of sneakers that have this kind of sole it's kind of the uh dark brow gum and it is so so durable now the shoe is like I said very well made and the sole is bendable so it's also very very comfy which I will talk a little bit about later on so the sambas retail for 100 USD and I honestly don't think that that's bad at all because they're very wellmade and it is made out of leather as well which you don't typically see in a lot of sneakers you don't really see that in New Balance or in Nike that often so I do feel like this is more of a premium sneaker but it has kind of the same price like other sneakers so I do feel like for the price it's very very reasonable now moving on to sizing and I think this is probably why a lot of people are watching this video to figure out sizing I will try my best to help you guys out so I am typically a size us7 I'm pretty true to size now I did get the Adidas sambus in the men's sizes so you do have them in women's sizes but I went for the men's sizes now because the Adidas sambas are unisex you can go for either a men's size and a women's size now how it works is that if you go for the men's size you size down one whole size from the men's size so in my case I'm a seven and I went for a 7 and 1/2 women's size and in the men's size it's a 6 and A2 the model of the shoe is very narrow and they're flat so I do highly recommend sizing up half a size if you have very wide feet you might even get away with sizing up a whole size but if you're really unsure about your sizing I would just recommend ordering half size up and see how that is I think that for most of people's feet that would be a great fit now talking about the Comfort level and this is a reason why I love Adidas Samba so much it's because they are super comfy now I have to admit when I first saw s Zas I just was highly influenced I just wanted these because I thought that you know I just needed them and I didn't really think or care about the Comfort level but when I got them I was so shocked by how comfy they actually are I can walk in these for hours and hours the entire day I'm just so impressed that Adidas sambas do not hurt my feet at all I actually think they the best traveling sneaker so moving on to the pros and cons I want to start off with some pros and I already shared a lot of Pros but another thing that I also really love about these shoes is that they go with everything honestly when I got them they go with my entire wardrobe so these really are my go-to sneakers I was really just planning to only get one and I really wanted the white one but when I got this I just wore it every single day with every single outfit so that's why I eventually decided to get the black pair as well another Pro is that it almost seems like these sneakers do not get dirty I've had this bear since last year and you honestly can't see any wear end hair and that's like that's pretty rare because these are still wide sneakers yes they have a lot of other contrast colors but it is mostly a white sneaker the same with the black ones and yes they're black but I actually wore them out on December Nights in San Diego and it had rained a little bit so it was quite muddy and I was so scared that I would ruin my sambas that was actually the first time when I was wearing these and coming back home and the next day I looked at them and I was like why do they still look brand new now moving on to cons everyone and their mother has a pair of sambas at this point it's not something that I love but for me personally because I get so much wear out of these I don't mind I still love them I don't get sick of them but it is definitely a con to just go out and see 10 other people wearing a pair of sambas now another con is that even though a lot of people own these shoes it's actually still hard to get your hands on these but they're usually sold out online and sometimes in store they're just not available in my size so I still don't think that this is a shoe that is super easy to get it's not as hard as it used to be but there're still kind of a hard to get you in my opinion now what I recommend the Adidas sambas 100% yes there is a reason why I got them in two colors I really only wanted to get one color and also because I really needed a white shoe I went for this one first but then as soon as I got this one I really wanted the black one and I'm so happy that I did I honestly don't think you can go wrong with any of these colors and if you have a capsule wardrobe I am telling you these will be your workhorses because they're going to go with every single outfit and they're just a class and an amazing shoe as always I have linked the shoes in the description if you want to check it out I hope they are in stock and your size I really hope this video was helpful let me know down in the comments which color you prefer the white somus or the black somus and also I would really appreciate it if you can like this video it helps me out so so much now I hope you all have a great day and I'll see you in the next video bye,2025-06-19 08:40:58.432749 UTC
QaP_9jbGw1s,Converse Chuck Taylor All Star,the Converse Chuck Taylor has been around for over 100 years since 1917 to be exact they were named after a Converse shoe salesman and basketball player and coach and this sneaker has been a staple really in closets since bands like the Ramones Nirvana and Green Day took them from the basketball court to the music stage in fact music has since been such a big part of the converse ethos that they even opened up a free recording studio for musicians back in 2011 are these really the greatest sneakers of all time or is this just a case of cultural Nostalgia let's get into it welcome to stray reviews I'm Lee and today I'm reviewing the I iconic Converse Chuck Taylor Allstar high top sneakers now I know you might be thinking Lee there is a thousand Chuck Taylor reviews out there well now there's a thousand in one also I noticed something a little bit different about my latest pair and I wanted to share that with you the inside of my newest pair of all star has a thinner textile lining like my old ones but this has kind of a strange squishy slightly padded quality to it making them just a tick more comfortable I tried but I could not find any information about this and so if you know what this is all about can you please let me know also I could just be losing my mind the outside of the all stars are the usual canvas upper for that classic Chuck Taylor look and feel and these uppers really have hardly changed at all since 1917 the footed on these is this orthol likee cushioning and it does help provide some much appreciated Comfort it is super thick I mean check that out and it's not intended to be re removable but it can come out pretty easily anyway one of the most recognizable things about these is the iconic Chuck Taylor ankle patch and the allstar branding that's on the heel check that out they also have eyelets near the sole for airf flow and they do help keep your feet cooler and drier as well the outsole has that classic diamond pattern and they're pretty grippy for the basketball court or gym or wherever you're going with these the so also features a mixed Groove and checkered pattern that is covered with a light layer of felt now the felt covering on the sole let's see there we go is originally patented by Converse to help classify the shoes as slippers rather than sneakers for lower Customs tariffs when importing from overseas so sneaky however the felt layer does wear off pretty quick quickly with wear like I mentioned the inside layer of Tex stle on the new Chucks or my new Chucks have kind of a padded quality to them the Chuck Taylor sells for $65 and is made in Vietnam also they do go on sale pretty often and I've picked them up for around $35 before I'm going to get into The Good the Bad and the bottom line but first I want to thank me for sponsoring this video I happen to be a fantasy author and if you're into fantasy novels I like to write them so I've got you covered you can check them out in the Amazon link below all right let's start with the good of the Converse Chuck Taylor Allstar first of all and I think most of all these have a massive wearability factor to them and it doesn't seem to matter who you are what your age is hopefully or what you pair them with they just go they're super simple they have a profile that doesn't like jump out at people and there's just something magical yes I said magical that seems to make these okay to wear with anything I even had a friend that wore them to get married in and in fact he even had the whole wedding party wearing them and it worked in addition to the incredible wearability and versatility they are light and comfortable I have no problem spending all day in these even days when I'm on my feet most of the day and they may not make like the best athletic shoes but they still feel all right they're also my preferred shoe when I'm riding my electric unicycle yes I do ride one of those and they do give me like a good feel and connection between my feet and the vehicle and they do provide some measure of ankle support when I'm riding it as well also if black is not your sneaker color of choice you can currently get these in 19 other colors or you can even go onto the Converse website and just design your own there're still pretty affordable after all these years at $65 so you're not not really like out much even if you have to replace them every year though mine usually last longer than a year and fact I've had these for several years and it really does uh give them a super low cost per wear in fact they have the lowest cost per wear of any of my shoes hey tap that like button if you're into the aesthetic of the classic chuck all right let's talk about the bad of the Converse Chuck Taylor allars well first of all these are kind of known to come apart right around the tow break after some wear and I've seen a lot of Chucks in fact these ones are kind of sort of beginning to do that and uh I've seen others where it's just really come completely apart from this here but that being said they're not really built for like the Long Haul like a Heritage boot or shoe they're only $65 after all and they don't really owe you in my opinion they don't really owe you like a lifetime of wear also these sneakers have a pretty narrow fit but they're also pretty long which is a complaint that I seldom make about shoes I have to take a half size down on these and just kind of like endure that narrow fit for a while until they stretch out a bit these are also pretty flat shoes which I've seen works well for weightlifters in the gym but there's not much support in them for like any sort of hard physical activity that involves more moving around than lifting weights it's actually kind of hard to believe these days that professional basketball players wore them in fact Rocky even ran in them in the first Rocky movie Back In 1976 you tell tell me what kind of activity do you do when you're wearing Chucks let me know down in the comments below all right I'm going to give you my bottom line opinion but if you're getting some value out of this today then I want to invite you to subscribe to the channel so that you'll catch my upcoming reviews okay the bottom line is that the Converse Chuck Taylor Allstar is a Timeless classic that really anyone can wear with almost anything on top of that there don't cost much now they may not be for those who need like a little more support but I've heard a lot of people claim that they are the most comfortable shoes that they've ever owned if you want to see a review of one of my all-time favorite leather sneakers then check out this one here thank me for hooking me up with these my opinions are my own and I want to thank you for watching I'll see you over in the next video,2025-06-23 11:21:40.922216 UTC
sIgWcriWbRI,New balance 550,the New Balance 550s are a pretty strange shoe there's a lot of weird aspects to the shoe and I'm really curious to cut them in half and that's exactly what we're going to do because people are worried that new balance is sold out and they're worried that this shoe is just an attempt to have a general release that's really cheap quality to the to capitalize on some hype and they're afraid that new balance has gone the way of Nike so we're going to cut it in half and see and I'll show you guys why this shoe is so strange if you want to browse the internet freely and

back guarantee so if you love it you keep it protect yourself online if you hate it it's no risk and it supports the channel so thanks again to nordvpn for sponsoring this video and a quick history of this shoe so this shoe was designed by the world famous Steve Smith and originally it was a basketball shoe that was released in 1989 but it was overshadowed by a lot of the more visual Tech like the air units and the Jordans and the Rebox the pumps all the other kind of gimmicky style Tech that was popular at that time this was just a very basic shoe so it just kind of fell out of favor eventually and then 30 years later Teddy santis of Al single-handedly resurrected the 550s from the grips of death and brought it back into cultural significance with the collaborative release of their versions of the sneak and the interesting thing is New Balance didn't have the the the patterns for the shoe they didn't have the plans for it they somehow lost it so they actually had to buy a pair from Japan and grab a bunch of the old sketches to recreate this shoe to as close as the original as possible which is crazy to me I don't know how you lose plans for a sneaker that you built so why do people like these shoes so much well they fit a niche a niche for people who don't like Nike who don't like this this the style of like the dunks or the Air Force Ones the Air Jordan Ones they want something a little bit different a little more understated for me I think I think it's an interesting combination of a retro a very retro sneaker combined with the dad shoe kind of style and I think that's a big part of why they're so popular and I particularly like them because they kind of remind me of like a golden era anime dad shoe but looks aren't everything leather quality at least for me matters about as much as looks and while these might be a really popular shoe and they look really cool none of that tells us the quality of the shoes and none of us none of that tells us if if this is a new balance cash grab to capitalize on the popularity of it but as for what we can tell about this leather if you look at the crosssection it's pretty clearly a chrome tanned leather and it is real leather cuz you can tell that by the bluing in the cross-section and it does look like it has a really heavy coating of polyurethane or plastic on top of it so let's see how it reacts to Flame and if you didn't see the Mischief video I posted a couple days ago that was a really good representation of what we're looking for with a heavy plastic coating and just pigment on top the a the Air Force 1es had a super heavy coating on top and it was ridiculous what it looked like when we burned it so let's do the same flame test to this shoe and you can see how it is just a very distinct layer that you can even just scrape off that's separate from the leather and that's why people don't like this leather is because it's what you're looking at isn't even the leather it's it's just a plastic coating but that doesn't always mean it's a lowquality leather what's really going to tell us is where that lies in the cross section so if we do a little cut and bend test and as we get that scraped away you can see that there is a little bit of a grain pattern on there I made a little mistake we all make mistakes it's part of Being Human turns out there's not actually a grain pattern on here it's just a really cheap suede with the plastic coating on top I thought I saw the grain but then we when we did the macro shots there's no grain in there so it's even worse than I originally thought terrible leather see you I'll be back so at least it isn't just a cheap suede with a heavy coating on top it but this leather looks really really thin and it is really really thin Le it's only 1 mm thick and most of the Nike Leathers we see out there are about 1.5 and like boot Leathers 2 to 3 mm so it is a really really thin leather so honestly not the best leather I would say it's on par with Nike if not worse because of how thin it is now that we know there's no grain pattern it's definitely worse than Nike Leather by breathability was one of the aspects that they sold the shoe on in 1989 because I had these perforated leather on the side here that was supposed to let these shoes breathe a little bit more so to test that we hooked it up to the breathability tester or fog machine or Kyle's Vape to see how much air would actually come out through those holes cuz I can't even tell if it's actually all the way to the inside and as you can see it just it just mostly comes out through the tongue there's not a whole lot escaping through that perforated leather and then as for the construction of this shoe and how this is built and all the components and this is the really interesting thing and the thing that intrigued me the most about doing this video and so the first thing to look at is this cupsole so it is a cupsole and it is sidewall stitched all the way through you can see the stitching on the inside but on the inside of the shoe or like the I guess that's the inside where what do you even call that where your two feet come together I guess it's the inside of the shoe well the inside of the shoe it's it's more of a 3/4 cupsole because it stops right there and you can see the exposed U foam midle what is the function of that not really anything you know it's it's more just for the look and as for the durometer and how dense and or squishy this out soole is we put the durometer tester on there comes into like a 77 so right on par with what you see with most sneakers from Nike and New Balance and then if we move to the inside of the shoe if we pull this insole out it's just an ortholite insole nothing bad nothing good and it does have this these like little wings that kind of come up this arch support doesn't do anything probably not but whatever but the cool thing is if you look inside of here that's fiberboard and fiberboard is usually something you only see in actual real retro shoes or you see it a lot in Boots almost all the boots from $300 and under have a fiberboard lasting board so that tells me that this shoe was board lasted instead of stroble stitched because there's no stroble stitch in there and so basically the way they build the shoe I'm assuming we'll see we get it cut in half is they wrap the upper all the way underneath of that lasting board the fiber board and then either glue it or sew it and then the cupsole is attached to the bottom with the foam in between and then the sidewall stitching is is sewn on so it's a really Hardy and strong construction compared to the compared to the stroble stitching construction because on stroble stitching that upper stops right where it meets that lasting board or that lasting material so it's a lot more similar to a boot style of construction and there are pros and cons associated with it the pros are it's super stable underfoot you got equal pressure on across the entire midsole because of how firm that fiber board is and it it doesn't roll and it doesn't twist it gives you a lot of lateral strength theoretically you could resole this shoe because of how strong this construction is this fiber board is going to slowly compress to the shape of your foot and give you that custom footprint that people really like and get the extra comfort from work boots but as for the cons it is harder Under Foot because you're directly standing on that really hard fiber board it's not nearly as flexible it's this shoe is actually pretty stiff and you're going to have some breaking period to get that footprint in there and to get that fiberboard loosened up and because of this construction it's it's a little bit heavier of a shoe especially with this chunky outsole and fiber board can break down over time we've seen it in Boots over and over again so even before we cut this in half right now this shoe is a lot more similar to the boots that we've cut apart and it's going to act a lot more similar to a boot but we don't really know for sure if all that's true because we haven't cut it in half we don't know how thick it is we don't know what the midsole actually is so let's cut them in half all right we got it chopped in half let's see how much like a boot this shoe actually is so let's see what's inside well this tongue is not sewn on very well which is kind of surprising it's really it's only a tiny little Stitch holding this entire tongue in there but look how thick this out soole is that's got to be the thickest sneaker out soole we've ever seen and you can also see how thick this fiberboard is you know that's that fiberboard is just as thick as basically any boot that has fiberboard in it that we've seen and you can also see how thick that foam midsole is it's going to give you some of that Squish and allow that fiberboard to compress to give you that custom footprint and you can also see how similar to a boot this shoe actually is like I'll put some b-roll over top of comparing this to like blond stones and some of these others these other boots in this $250 price range that are built almost identically to this and you can see that the upper is fully tucked underneath the shoe and that would allow the shoe to be resold which is kind of crazy for a $110 hyped sneaker it's a really strange shoe especially after we've cut apart so many Jordans and so many Yeezys they're all built semi the same this one is dis compl L different so is this shoe worth $110 well going into this I didn't think it was I I thought it was going to be kind of a negative review to be honest because of how bad the leather looks from the outside but now seeing the inside and how it's built and pulling this insole out I think it's a pretty killer shoe for $110 take out about 10% of the enthusiasm because I got that little bit about the leather having a grain pattern in it wrong bye-bye so then to the final question of this video is New Balance selling out by selling this shoe is it a quick cash grab based on the popularity of these coming back I don't think so I think this is definitely the worst leather we've ever seen in a new balance and I understand how people from the outside could see that and assume it's a terrible cash grab on new balan's part and if you don't care about this particular style of construction and you just want a better leather upper I I get where you're coming from but I I love these shoes I think they're they're really cool I I like the construction I like the way they look I like everything about them but the leather but just imagine if if New Balance actually made this a really high quality sneaker made a leather insole made a lot higher quality leather upper and just made this cuz they could do it they they make higher quality sneakers so I I don't know why they don't just make this a good sneaker but let me know what you guys think this one really surprised me and I had a lot of fun making this video but thank you guys so much for all your support I'm so sweaty and this has been a long filming week because we're putting out a lot of content so I appreciate all your guys' support and helping us be able to afford to chop up these shoes to really show you what you're really spending your hard earned money on it means a lot to me and everyone at the Rose Anvil crew so thank you guys see you,2025-06-23 14:50:44.097983 UTC
Wbb1cRA030Q,New Balance 990,the New Balance 990 Series has undoubtedly been some of the best shoes on the market for decades now with its combination of high quality materials classic looks and of course Comfort late last year New Balance released the 990 V6 in this gray colorway which came as a bit of a shock to fans of the brand because of how different the shoe looks compared to previous versions while I have been wearing these pretty much every day for over a month now and I just picked up the latest black colorway and in this video I'm going to be telling you why the New Balance 990 V6 is my absolute favorite New Balance sneaker thank you so these are priced in the U.S at a 199 retail but in Europe they're priced at 250 euros which if you do the conversion that's around 275 US dollars so yeah it is very very expensive to buy these outside the US I have started to notice that the gray pair has gone on sale in some places so I was able to save a few bucks with these so now might be a good time to finally get yourself a pair so with these at first I'll be honest I wasn't really feeling these when I saw pictures but it did slowly and steadily really start to grow on me over time and it took me basically four months after the release to finally buy the V6 for myself and after wearing these for over a month now I have to say I have come around a hundred percent or 180 degrees whatever that saying is but I've totally come around on the shoe and I pretty much love them now from a design point of view the shoe does look a lot different than previous versions of the 990 and that is for one main reason and that is that midfoot panel they've completely removed that that's been there for the last five versions it's what New Balance calls the midfoot saddle and it's where the end logo used to be before but now instead you have these suede panels and mesh panels that start at the heel and go all the way to the toe for like a much more streamlined look which I actually really like I think it's quite a modern look I've heard one very common critique about the shoe people keep saying that these look like a Sketcher shoe and in the beginning I might have been one of those people but honestly I've been on the Skechers website I couldn't find one sneaker on there that looked anything as close to or as good as these so I don't know where that narrative came from I do not think these look like Skechers I take that back I think these look really good I'm a big fan of that n logo in particular it's bigger it's got that 3M and I like how it's kind of peeking through because the top and the bottom of it are covered by those suede panels but the reason why this has become my everyday shoe and I'm not kidding when I say that I literally wear these every day they're right by my door wear them when I'm taking the dog out when going to the supermarket this is just my absolute go-to sneaker and that reason is just how comfortable these are compared to previous models first of all they're just much more light lightweight than previous models in fact they're so lightweight that I think you might even get away with using these as running shoes because lifestyle shoes are just not supposed to feel this light the cushioning on this pair is completely different than previous versions it contains New Balances fuel cell technology which is something that they have taken from their running models in fact just go on the New Balance website right now type fuel cell and you'll notice that every single shoe that pops up is a running shoe except for one the V6 so that should give you an idea of just how lightweight and comfortable these are it feels really great on feet the cushioning is not as soft as some of those running models I described and I'm honestly kind of glad that it isn't because a very soft cushiony midsole is not something that really works well for lifestyle use so if you're used to that firm cushioning of the previous 990 models you're still going to be pleasantly surprised by just how comfortable the V6 is and you won't be thrown off completely these shoes are still very stable to walk on while at the same time being very very comfortable quickly if you've been finding this video useful so far make sure you hit that subscribe button and also smash the like button it really helps me out thank you guys so let's get into sizing on these Now in America there's multiple versions of these available you can get them in standard sizing or wide sizing or XXL sizing since I live in Europe and I do not have access to those different sizes I cannot comment on that however if you are going to buy these in standard sizing for me they fit best at true to size but that is also the same way that all of my previous 990s have fit me a lot of people say that they like to go down half a size in 99 days and if that's the case it will fit exactly the same in these as well the midfoot area does feel more snug than previous versions of the 990 but not snug enough that you will be going up half a size so once again that sizing suggestion is stick with your normal 990 size whatever it was previously but it's not like these are selling out so you should be able to go into the store and try it out for yourself now surprisingly there hasn't been too much hype or noise about the 990 V6 so far probably the biggest release was that Action Bronson pair which released last month which might be the most hated or love it colorway of a shoe I've ever seen still little bit undecided on those but I'm very very excited for the upcoming colorway of the Action Bronson collab definitely copying that for the toe there's also supposedly some made in USA Teddy santis pairs of the V6 that we'll be dropping at some point this year and also just looking at this black colorway is it just me or does the V6 look just as good in black as it does in Gray which is not something I could say for previous versions of the 990. this black and gray pair just looks super super clean let me know in the comments what are your thoughts on this particular colorway overall I really do think the New Balance 990 V6 is simply one of the best shoes you can buy today the combination of this lightweight feel the super comfortable cushioning and this modern look make this pretty much the perfect everyday shoe so don't be afraid to give this a try I don't think you will regret it and that's it let me know your thoughts on the 990 V6 the links to all my socials as well as the sneaker podcast those are all in the description I'll catch you guys in the next video peace,2025-06-23 14:42:43.766019 UTC
fBBy_tO0H9c,New Balance 990,the New Balance 990 V6 is upon us recently released and Retail is 200 bucks here's my hot take buckets hear me out I think you could argue this is the greatest sneaker ever made I'm talking just all around sneaker you know if there was a zombie apocalypse if it was eminent on the horizon the zombies were coming you could only grab one pair of sneakers I mean you got the cushioning you got the subtle but cash but sporty aesthetic I'm just saying maybe you go with a pair of Tim's maybe you go with a pair of Jordan Ones maybe you go with these the sneaker's so good they never stop making them or so they say,2025-06-23 14:42:44.417137 UTC
ZxQdkvNPRoU,Nike Air Max 90,the Nike Air Max 90 reverse duck camo also known as duck camo is returning to retailers in September while not a restock Nike reproduced the shoes to resemble the 2020 release utilizing red on the mesh base the highlight of this pair is the camouflage detailing on the mudu guard and panels this pair resembles if the OG Air Max 90 infrared had a baby with the atmos Air Max 90 overall the materials used are solid and and in my opinion a dope fall shoe dropping on September 19th for 140 are you picking up a pair or passing,2025-06-23 11:26:31.764606 UTC
YsBP0hyrmrw,Onitsuka Mexico 66,"the Ona tiger Mexico 66 is one of the hottest sneakers on the market right now but how did this legendary sneaker spark the minds of millions and is it worth the attention it is received in 2024 well we got a pair right here and today we're going to put them through the test I'm Reggie casual let's get it the Mexico 66 traces its Origins back to 1966 when it was developed as the Olympic shoe for Japan and as a flagship model to compete with the likes of Puma and Adidas and if we compare the Silhouettes of the ultra popular Samba and the burgeoning Revival of the Puma speedcat we can begin to see the similarities of Silhouettes and just why the Mexico 66 is among one of the top trending sneakers in the world not to mention all these sneakers are pretty much the grandchildren of the German Army trainer but I digress the 66 however has been given a sort of Pop Culture legendary status but that status with a bit of Stolen Valor famously associated with Bruce Lee as the sneaker he wore in the 1978 film Game of Death the shoe Rose to prominence problem is these aren't the Mexico 66 just like this isn't Bruce Lee the Mexico 66 popularity would rise again almost 30 years later when Quinton Tarantino's 2003 film Kill Bill volume 1 paid homage to Game of Death in the iconic restaurant scene but again those weren't the Mexico 66 they were in fact the Ona tiger Tai Chi a sneaker with considerably less popularity in the mainstream but to hardcore fans of martial arts films a Grail of sorts side note for those of you wondering the taii does exist but on tiger smartly doesn't make them widely available the taii in fact is only available as far as I know at oner made being made in Japan which predictably raises its price to made in Japan levels and the quality that so for all of you wearing the 66 and thinking you got the kill billies or the game of deathy the sad reality is that you've been kind of Bamboozled by onica Tiger themselves sorry with that being said the switcheroo has cemented the Mexico 66 status and Ona tiger even released this version the Mexico 66 SD which is made with higher quality materials and a slightly more narrow silhouette that is closer to the taii chi the top eyelets are given the metal treatment the laces are thinner and the upper and sole is completely yellow in comparison to the standard model which features a white stripe on the so but all that background and history is inconsequential if they aren't worth its Newfound popularity status however before we get into that a message from our sponsor

get started on that site and use Squarespace today so I'm about to on every hat of style guide when it comes to the Mexico 66 excuse my French and forgive me in advance for being let's say blunt the Mexico 66 and its competitors the samba the speedcat the Gat are relatively easy to style because they go with damn near anything they they just do seriously shirt pants or shorts 66 done for those ladies or more androgynous men out there dress skirt 66 finished sure a Slimmer silhouette does a bit more wonders for the shoe and a slight cropped pant or wide leg can give it some flare but let's be honest most of you don't need a guide to how to style these because you're likely wearing something right now that goes with the sneakers or you at least have something already and as some of you know I don't really like giving styling tips but in this case do you really need some now for me personally I like the crop pant 66 combo as it's more reminiscent of That Kill Bill Game of Death look but I also employ the layered up wide drapey combo with a sneaker contrast to pop out my otherwise predominantly monochrome and black outfits it's certainly a matter of taste and again if you're familiar with the samba at all it's basically the very same setup you could do pretty much the same thing the 66 does have a slightly more iconic pop culture status in my personal opinion particularly for martial arts movie fans especially when it comes to that yellow pair but due to being from a less popular brand in Ona tiger it doesn't really share the same exposure as its bigger competitors now as far as the mainline shoe versus these the SDS it's a matter of choice athetic and price and also quality as said before the SDS are more narrow yet sport High in materials and contrary to popular belief they aren't made in Japan but Vietnam now they do have Mexico 66 that are made in Japan but you'll find them again at onita K tiger nepo here in Japan or I think they have a location in Singapore and I think online you can order from nepo M so you have some options there but are they worth it are they worth the hype I really don't like using that phrase but yeah are they worth it now I have trouble believing anything is worth the hype mainly because getting involved with mainstream Trends can be an unending Rabbit Hole of keeping up with the Joneses however as a person who is currently divorced from Nike and in a tenuous relationship with Adidas at best I find myself gravitating more towards onita K tiger as my go-to for just general releases and the Mexico 66 is a no-brainer for me as I am a fan of Bruce Lee films including Game of Death and I also like the movie Kill Bill so it works out now part of the reason why the Mexico 66 and the samba and the Gat and all these kind of low sneakers in my opinion are becoming popular right now is because they have this ability to go with everything and it's easier for individuals to focus on the entirety of an outfit rather than solely relying on sneakers the problem is is that when these hyper micr Trends turn around like the samba everybody starts getting in on it so it becomes kind of like this Rat Race to find the next big thing and the Mexico 66 found some popularity in between the samba hype and now the Puma Revival but it still is kind of the odd Choice the odd ball so to speak and that may be due to the fact that onitaa tiger in its entirety isn't as nearly as popular in the west as it is here in Japan and greater Asia in fact on zoo. JP Japan's number one Fashion online site these sneakers have more than 127,000 people who've liked it who've wished to buy it but popular doesn't necessarily mean that you should buy them of course Trends are definitely worth knowing but a lot of the time it becomes so ubiquitous that it just kind of want to avoid them in any case the worth of the 66 is absolutely up to you I enjoy them because compared to others out there they hold a personal interest value while also being incredibly wellmade particularly the SD model now they are not as popular as the samba that is a given but that kind of gives them a bit more freedom from ubiquity and with people moving quickly towards the Puma speedcat the Mexico 66 stands as the off-brand Choice while still remaining well known enough to be considered a more cultured choice so to speak now let us know if you are a fan of the Mexico 66 in the comments or do you fancy the other options like the samba the Gat or the Puma speedcat or maybe another sneaker maybe none of these at maybe you're just like I don't like none of these dog or what you can do is you can suggest another brand topic style or product you'd like for us to cover particularly if they're coming from Japan because you know that is what we do and if you can join us on YouTube or patreon for future benefits and production credits this ensures that we'll be able to deliver more consistently the showcases you'd like to see as well as keeping this thing going and serving you bigger and better reviews and insights while also helping us build a platform that makes all these things we talk about right here accessible to to you because that is the end game at the very least drop a sub like turn on notifications if you found this content valuable or entertaining to you but most importantly keep it locked right here for all of your info in international fashion and culture from Tokyo it's your boy and keep it casual Shas and I will see you guys in a minute",2025-06-23 14:44:46.283362 UTC
UGuUskVXBms,Air Jordan 1,"the air jordan 1 shattered backboard is one of the best air jordan releases of all time and finally 10 years after it first released jordan brand is bringing it back for the first time this is the 2025 air jordan 1 shattered backboard but can it live up to the hype let's find out in the summer of michael jordan's rookie year in 1985 he decided to go play an exhibition game in italy the italian club that he was making an appearance for was stfananiel trieste whose color scheme was orange black and white during that game michael scored 30 points which is pretty decent but it wasn't the most impressive thing of the entire event during one of his dunks he jumps up grabs the rim and shatters the backboard and that event became one of the most legendary stories in basketball history especially because it happened to the goat so to pay homage to that event in 2015 jordan bran released the shattered backboard air jordan 1's which came in the color scheme of the jersey that he was wearing for that team and featured a shattered backboard graphic on the insole as legendary as that story is and as great as this colorway is specifically because of the color blocking the reason this shoe became so popular and one of the most iconic air jordan sneakers of all time is because this shoe featured some of the best leather ever used on jordan sneakers for the last 10 years whenever a new jordan comes out people always ask the question is the leather on that shoe shattered backboard quality and that's because the shattered backboard one set the bar in terms of modern leather quality on air jordan sneakers this shoe just feels incredible in the hand that said it is still a mass-produced pair of sneakers it's not as high quality as a $1,000 handmade designer shoe especially not leather quality-wise but compared to any of the recent jordan releases or any of the releases around the time of this shoe releasing it was miles ahead it set the bar for quality the tumbled leather on the side of the shoe felt incredibly soft even the leather on the toe just felt so plush and looked so good you could see the pores around the heel of the shoe which is not something that you can usually see on air jordan sneakers and there was this really nice color variation because it was real leather and it wore really nicely and man the grain on the edges of the leather panel it just looked amazing and it gets better with age the more that you wear it so when a rumor came out that jordan brand was finally bringing back the shatter backboards the question that immediately came to everyone's mind was is the quality going to be as good and i don't know if you caught my comparison video between the shattered backboards and the new shatterback boards but unfortunately the answer is not as good as i was hoping and of course we'll get into all of that later on in the video but with that being said if you want a chance to win a nintendo switch 2 for yourself i'm actually giving away one over on my tech channel which is linked in the top of the description below of course like all of my giveaways i'm running it through core which is the fairest and i think the best way to do it so if you guys want to have a chance to win this console for yourself you need to get the core badges again they're all going to be on my tech channel some of which will be on this channel so make sure to subscribe to both check them both out the giveaway ends at the end of the month so hopefully by the end of the month you're playing a brand new switch too we'll see what happens for those of you like myself who have been eagerly waiting the retro of the classic shatter backboards the good news is you don't have that much longer to wait these shoes should release on august 23rd 2025 for a retail price of 180 bucks now of course if you want to grab a pair early like i did you can check them out through the youtube shopping tab on your screen down below currently resale prices are kind of high that being said the time that i've spent with this shoe and also the resale prices of some of the other air jordan ones that have released recently i would assume that this price is going to drop pretty quickly so in my opinion if you want to grab these early there's a good chance that the prices will drop to probably around retail is my guess possibly under retail once they actually release i could be wrong about that but we'll see i'm kind of dancing around the subject here but you guys will see why in a minute but before we get into the shoes themselves let's first take a look at the packaging and i've got to say that jordan brand knocked this box out of the park why is it that some of jordan brand's lackluster sneaker releases end up having the best boxes not trying to foreshadow too hard but probably catching my drift now if you guys remember the 2015 release of the shatter backboards came in a standard air jordan 1 box it was black and red you guys all know the drill this time around jordan brand decided to change it up and not only make the logo on the box orange to match the shoe but also give this box this really cool shattered glass print this print is so sick and it really makes this box super unique super cool and probably one of the coolest jordan 1 boxes that i've ever seen problem is you can't wear jordan boxes so a lot of people were like ""why do you review the boxes?"" well it's part of the packaging for me it's important for you you might not care but i got to give credit where credit's due they did a great job with this box this shattered glass pattern actually extends all the way around the box even to the bottom which is super cool now getting to the size tag as you can see this is not exactly my standard size this is a size eight i got them from bird kicks it was the only pair that i could actually grab that was even remotely close to my size the official colorway of this shoe is black black sail starfish and again it is a size eight i'm a size nine but as you'll see through some of the b-roll shots i did squeeze my chunky foot into this tiny sneaker i guess it's all relative because someone with a size 12 would say that they have a chunky foot and my foot's tiny but now let's dive into the brand new shattered back boys themselves and first things first we got to talk about the quality it's not as good in fact it's nowhere near as good the leather on the originals feels different it feels immediately different and more premium the leather on the new pair feels like every single other pair of air jordan ones it's plasticky it's stiff it's got this like eh tumbled texture that's obviously not not real uh not the tumbled leather is a real thing it's a texture that's literally tumbled onto the leather but in this case it just feels worse i don't know if it's actually tumbled on or if it's pressed on or how they do it with this more plasticky feeling leather but who knows so i'm going to compare these shoes as we go throughout this review and talk about the differences as we get to the different parts of the shoe so we'll start things off around the toe you've got this black mud guard on the 2025 pair the leather is your standard black leather it's kind of stiff it's nothing special on the 2015 pair it was soft it was supple it was beautiful moving up to the leather on the toe the first thing you'll notice is that the color is different on these shoes the leather on the 2015 pair is a much lighter shade of orange it's closer to a yellow the color on the new pair is much closer to a red they're both definitely orange neither one is not an orange or leaning too close towards red or yellow but i will say that the orange on the 2025 pair is darker and more red than the orange on the 2015 pair and maybe this is just because i like the 2015 pair better i'm not totally sure but i think i prefer the actual color of the orange better on the 2015 pair it feels more aged and this is the color that it always was like the leather didn't change color over the last 10 years it still looks like this even looking at brand new pairs the new pair just seems more it's not as natural of an orange not that you get too much natural orange leather but if you did i think it would be closer to this than to this it kind of feels like this was naturally sweetened and this was artificially sweetened if you get my drift in terms of the actual feel i mean it's it's night and day this is kind of stiff regular air jordan 1 leather this is your sort of plush shatter backboard leather uh it's disappointing i can't i can't sugarcoat it moving up in the shoe you've got more of that black leather on the eye it's the same black leather you have around the toe weaving through the eyelets you get a set of black flat laces which is the laces that i just ended up using cuz that's how i have them on my original shattered backboards they do also give you a set of matching orange laces which it's actually a little bit lighter than the orange used on the shoe which is a little odd but you get them if you want to switch them out i don't think i ever would but you can if you want to underneath the laces you've got a pretty standard black nylon tongue and towards the top of the tongue you've got this white nike air tag with nike air embroidered into it in orange now just for the sake of comparison the tag and the feel of the tongue is basically exactly the same as the 2015 pair they both are nylon they both come in black i guess the embroidery placement on the tag is a little bit different on the older pair it's kind of a little bit lower you've got some more white towards the top on the newer pair it's a little bit more centered moving inside the shoe the sock liner comes in black and it's a very similar material to what you had on the original shatter backboards however the foam inside is not as soft like the foam on this shoe just feels more pillowy this one feels more like you press into it and it immediately bounces back this one feels more i don't know like a just like a softer foam that's really all it is it's a softer foam i don't think that's because of age either it just feels like a different foam now it looks like the design of the insole is pretty similar to the original if not the same however the color of the printing is a little bit different probably to match the orange on the upper of the shoe now when it comes to sizing and fit this is where things get a little bit tough because i don't have a true size 9 that's what i usually wear and i'm not just talking about the new shatterburg 1.0's these are a size eight but in the original 1.0's i was only able to get a size eight and a half so even this one is a half size down so i don't have either in my true size but i will say compared to other shoes that have released around the same time and look construction-wise the same this one true to size this one also true to size now construction-wise the older pair the 2015 pair isn't as comfortable underfoot they've sort of made some comfort adjustments throughout the years to make the newer versions of the shoe a bit more comfortable which i appreciate and generally i'd say newer pairs of air jordan 1's have a wider toe box and it looks like this one does as well so that's a plus i think comfort-wise this pair should be ever so slightly more comfortable but realistically it's still a jordan 1 and jordan 1's are all not that comfortable and as far as sizing goes i would say go true to size like every other pair of jordan 1's of course if you've never tried on a pair of jordan ones before go down to your local foot locker try a pair on i'm sure they have a ton of pairs available they'll probably have these available too is my guess maybe i'm wrong so try a pair on first before you drop the 180 bucks or however much it ends up being continuing back in the shoe to the midfoot we get to another pretty big departure from the original release and that's the new color of the midfoot leather on the original pair you get this very soft and nicely tumbled sail colored leather on the new pair it's bright white and it's not soft of all the things that they decided to change i understand the quality although i hate the fact that they didn't update the quality i get that that's not exactly the same like the original but the color of the midfoot panel why would you not make this sale like the original instead of the sale color that you get in the original you get a white midfoot panel which i think also doesn't look as good i personally much prefer the more yellow colored orange accents on this shoe and the sail colored midfoot panel to the much redder orange on this shoe with the white midfoot panel at a distance though realistically if you're wearing the shoe you're probably not going to be able to tell them apart same thing that you have on the lateral side you have on the medial side unfortunately and then moving towards the back of the shoe you've got more of this sort of dark orange leather that when you compare it side by side to the original it is night and day man it's crazy like this is all one consistent shade of orange which is fine there's nothing wrong with that but on the original release there's some color variation you can see the grain through the edges of the leather like you can see that on this pair too but it's obviously nicer you can see pores in this one you can't see pores in this one you can see color variation and like certain parts are a little bit more yellow or a little bit more orange you can see much more going on in the actual leather itself on the original release versus the new release and while they feel similar because this leather is sort of stretched over the heel of the shoe it's pretty obvious that the original pair is significantly nicer as you probably could have guessed by this point the leather around the top of the ankle the black leather is also nicer on the original it's still not amazing on the original this leather is just kind of your standard jordan leather at least for the time on the original but on the new pair it's it's plasticky one other interesting change but it kind of makes sense based on the time that these shoes released is that the wings logo is slightly different on the 2015 pair the wings logo is pressed into the leather or debossed into the leather on the 2025 pair it's actually much truer to the og where it's embossed out of the leather like you've got the texture of the ball the texture of the wing kind of coming out of the shoe i actually think i prefer because this is the more original way to do it this is the way that they did it in 1985 but i also didn't have a problem with the way they did it back in the day so for me either one is fine doesn't really matter maybe that's one thing that this pair has over the old pair maybe i like the wings logo better not everyone will but i guess i do and the box the box is better i like the box better moving down on these shoes to the midsoles the midsole on the newer release does seem whiter than it was on the older release that could also be because of age like i've worn this pair a little bit and this pair's rubber is also 10 years older than the rubber on this pair so maybe it just yellowed a little bit over time i'm not totally sure i wouldn't be surprised either way like if the rubber is just whiter overall and this one also aged a little bit finally moving to the bottom of the shoe you've got a matching orange outsole on the new pair of course you did have that in the old pair my pair is worn um the orange is obviously redder on this pair than on the original which again would make sense because it matches the leather so overall not only are there differences in design between these two shoes and color between these two shoes but there's also a pretty big discrepancy in quality the original pair felt amazing still feels amazing is one of the best jordan ones to ever release the new pair is a jordan 1 retro a standard jordan 1 retro with shatter backboard color blocking that's the best way to say it it's wild because even the shatter backboard 2.0's which weren't as nice as this shoe still feel better than the new version of the original it really is it's nothing special man it's it's really disappointing to say if you missed out on the original shattered backboards and you want that color blocking look you want the orange and you want the black then yeah grab the new pair if you think for even a second the quality of this pair is as good as the original sorry it's just not straight up it's not go to your local nike outlet right now check out a pair of jordan 1's or even your local foot locker check out a pair of recently released air jordan 1's a standard colorway not a limited pair that's what this feels like is that the worst thing in the world no not at all but when the original pair was known for its quality known for the way that it felt the fact that the retro is not even close sucks but hey if you made it to this point in the video let me know your thoughts on the new shattered backboard 1.0's will you be grabbing a pair for yourself i'd love to know leave it in the comment section down below don't forget to

IeYOEIA2-MA,PUMA Suede,the puma suede's history spans to over 50 years and counting from olympic athletes to original b-boys in the bronx the puma suede has proven to be one of the most highly sought-after sneakers in the world and in the 50 plus years the shoe has been around the puma suede has never lost its cultural influence especially in hip-hop in this video we took a look at one of the most iconic sneakers of all time and what you need to know before buying them what is good sneaks welcome back to another video it's your boy snickerlife for the one time you give me a huge favor and hit the thumbs up if you're new here subscribe do you think the subscribe button we talk about everything sneakers here credit all that fun stuff sneakers credit life growing up being an adult success building a brand i don't know it's a bunch of everything it's a sneaker life you know what i'm saying other than that you guys can find me on instagram snapchat twitter all at mikethecompass i'm everywhere but let's get into this review man one of the most iconic sneakers and i mean that regards to like i said over 50 years of history you know the first ever puma suede was essentially the puma crack back in 1968 which is hilarious to think about um after a few years they ended up changing the name and stuck with puma suede they did change a few aesthetics with it also but you know the real iconic part about this sneaker is really anyone who's everyone started with a pair of suede at one point if you didn't know back in the day this was the first sneaker to really have this suede material you know it just hit different and i think that's one thing that puma still to this day the materials are always so premium for the price point of 70 now it has went up since 1968 just a tad but obviously inflation for them to still keep these premium materials such a simple iconic silhouette still at a 70 price point i think that's very solid but you know besides the shoe let's take a look at the box i think one of my favorite things about what puma does with the boxes they keep it simple i mean it's nothing spectacular you got your puma logo all over the side you have a little bit of size conversion on the bottom of the box real simple nothing crazy but what i love and they do this a lot is they actually put a picture of what shoe you have this helps a lot if you don't have any shoe containers or if you just have like a stack of boxes i'm like okay that's exactly what i want because it could be a suede classic but is it the red pair is it the black pair is it the gold pair you know whatever color i have that i'm looking for i love that they do that so that is the one thumbs up for puma now there's a few main points that i want to talk about when it comes to the puma suede like i said this is a classic you cannot go wrong with these um you guys can see in the on foot i have the long white socks on perfect for summer perfect for fall really an all year round shoe i mean maybe not the best in snow duh but i mean other than that it's not snowing all the time this is a great shoe to be able to wear and you know they do have high tops too so you can't go wrong there i really wanted to nail this point this specific one thing that i really wanted to bring up with this specific run of the xxi or l whatever you want to call it the sizing on them i personally always go true to size of everything i wear size 12 i do have somewhat of a wider foot but nothing too crazy and with these i could have easily went with an 11 and a half which is very rare for me they do run a tad big and i've noticed i have a lot of room in the sneaker so just some sizing advice if you can most boutiques and stores typically have these in stock so i would just go in and try them out or you can just go ahead and trust my word on it but but even going with a size 12 it's fine it's really not that big of a deal um just ahead of time a little bit tighter you know nothing can't wear them completely loose as far as the details go on this shoe you have a full suede upper obviously hence puma suede a synthetic leather lining and let me tell you the cushioning in this shoe is premium my camera keeps playing with me today hey man we're playing with me this is just one of those shoes that you literally open the box unlace them lace them up and keep it pushing which i love about that you don't necessarily have to break them in i wore these all day and haven't had any problems which is extremely impressive like coming from me man because so specific like you know when you be out all day and you just got a brand new pair of shoes and your feet are just screaming you don't actually have the problem with that and it must be the technology that they use within this insole but overall very solid shoe really the main takeaways of this video of watch before you buy is number one go down half size honestly or just go try them on number two all suede upper premium at a price point of only 70 which is honestly pretty dope and it's just a shoe that you can literally wear year year-round and goes with so many different fits whether you're wearing jeans whether you're wearing shorts you can really dress these up dress them down it's just the perfect lifestyle shoe which is hard to come by these days and it really doesn't end there you know they've done so many different collabs with huge names like rihanna the weeknd big sean there's been so many different models and runs of these so many colors just tons of options it's like i just really don't think you can get a better bang for your buck than these and i think this is a great sneaker to start out a collection you know whether you're og or a youngin you know you're just starting out i think this is a really solid start as far as just getting a sneaker that's widely available and comes with premium materials it kind of gives you that appreciation for the history of sneakers and you know just how far they've come i mean over 50 years of keeping such a basic silhouette and constantly being popular is amazing honestly but yeah guys that's pretty much all i have for you um i'll leave you with that on foot and you guys can let me know or the puma suede the copper drop let me know any stories that you might have about this specific sneaker but this is your boy sneaker life i'll catch you guys in the next one run it [Applause] [Applause],2025-06-23 14:42:12.996602 UTC

KEOC5sdhDbs,Adidas Samba,there may be no pair of shoes that's more instantly recognizable than the Adidas sambas these shoes were created all the way back in 1949 and had a thin Rubber Sole in order to give players more traction on hard and icy surfaces and since then the sambas have evolved over time for use in both Futsal and for playing in the street but they're also just a popular lifestyle shoe and a lot of people just buy them because of the way that they look but our Samba is actually good for playing football in that's exactly what we're going to be talking about in this video so I've had this pair of sambas for over four years as you can tell by all the wear and tear and they have seen quite a few games on my end I'm going to be covering the design the fit the durability as well as what they're actually like to play in and if you are interested in picking up a pair of these shoes I'll leave a link in the description where you can find them online so let's get straight into it by talking about the design of the sambas so as I mentioned these shoes have been around for over 70 years and the design for the most part has stayed the same every single year and what you're going to notice immediately with these shoes is they're going to have leather material all throughout the midfoot as well as the iconic three stripes of Adidas on both sides of the shoe and then you're going to finish it off with a suede toe box at the front of the shoe it's a really iconic design it stayed the same for so long and it really separates it from almost any other shoe in this category the sambas also have a traditional lacing system here that offers a lot of lockdown the laces are pretty casual I'd say they're wide and you know they're not as modern as you would find on a lot of other current indoor models you also have a pretty long tongue as well it takes a little bit of getting used to it first but after wearing them for just a few times you get used to having that extra material around the tongue and then stitched onto that tongue you're just going to have that classic Adidas Samba label as well you will notice in the lacing system here they have one hole that's a little bit beneath all of the others so if you do choose to feed your laces through that hole there it's going to give you a little bit more lockdown and it's going to pull both sides of the upper a little bit closer to your feet then moving on to the a gum rubber outsole it stayed pretty much the same since the boots Inception as well it's a little bit less than an inch thick and it stays roughly the same thickness all the way from the heel to the toe of the boot the outsole is really rigid throughout the heel as you would expect from most traditional football boots and it has a little bit more flexibility throughout the toe box as you can see there's a lot of texture and patterning on the outsole as well just to give the shoes a little bit more grip on those hard surfaces and that's pretty much it for the outside of the boot on the inside of the boot you have an insole that is non-removable but has held up pretty well over time and then you have some woven textile material that's also pretty comfortable and breathable for your feet now we've talked a little bit about the design let's move on to the fit of the sambas so I was a little bit concerned when I first got these shoes because I thought they appeared a little bit narrow when looking at them from the outside but even as a player with wide feet I actually found these shoes to be really comfortable granted I have had a really long time to break these in but I would typically wear a size 10 and a half Us in Nike and Adidas shoes and these in a 10 and a half fit me perfectly so I would say if you are looking to get a pair they do fit true to size and as I mentioned although the toe box does seem to taper slightly I find that it still offers enough space for my toes and I don't feel like I'm getting crushed at the front of the shoe and when I first started wearing these shoes and playing them regularly I also didn't notice getting any blisters in either the front of the shoe or the heel and the lockdown is also really great as is the case with any shoe that has a traditional lacing system whenever I'm going to be playing in a game or if I'm going to a training session I just make sure to tie the shoes relatively tight throughout the entire lacing system and then if I'm just wearing them casually I'll usually loosen them up considerably if you're not used to wearing a shoe with a tongue that's this extended it's probably going to take you a little bit to get used to but after a few days you'll hardly notice that it's there overall they hold up pretty well at a competitive level when you are playing indoor soccer or indoor football whatever you call it and they also hold up pretty well if you're just wearing them casually they don't feel too aggressive or tight or overly snug feet they just feel like a casual everyday sneaker when you have the laces adjusted to be a little bit looser and for that reason I think that the fit of these shoes is just really versatile so the next question would be what about the durability of these shoes how have they held up over time well in my opinion considering how much I've gotten the chance to actually wear these shoes and how many miles I put them through which is a lot I think that they've held up pretty well after wearing these shoes for over four years the only noticeable damage I would say is towards the inside of the heel here where you can see that the material has gotten a little bit scuffed and a few layers have been worn through you can also see that the heel of this shoe has been put out of place as well but the real reason for that is because I constantly put on these shoes without untying the laces and I end up just scuffing the heel by putting them on in a lazy way despite getting some damage to the material just on the heel liner here I don't really notice that when I'm wearing the shoes and it doesn't really have any impact on the comfort and then another area where I have noticed some wear and tear as well is just on the outsole here especially towards the heel you can see that a lot of that grip and texture has worn down here just by a few millimeters and you can actually tell that it has made this sole here a little bit thinner than the rest of the shoe just because it's worn at the heel over time but now that that's out of the way let's talk about some of the good things about the durability on this shoe first off the sole separation or should I say the lack of Soul separation when you look at these shoes the Suede and the leather towards the toe box and around the midfoot it's still completely intact with the rubber outsole pretty much just the same as the day I got them there's also been essentially no damage to the suede or leather itself I don't notice any cracking other than just the light fading and dirt that's accumulated on the shoes they're pretty much in the same condition as well since the day I got them I think that pretty much just speaks to the quality of the materials that Adidas has continued to use in the construction of these shoes but I'm just really happy because there's not that many shoes that I own that I can still comfortably wear after four years so now let's talk about the playability of the sambas and what they're actually like to use when you're Outdoors or on a court so for reference when I'm playing in the solos I'm usually going to be wearing them on the street so on asphalt or on a tennis court like material and I would say that the touch on the ball when you're wearing a sambos is really similar to that of wearing a leather football boot you get that really nice padded feel on the ball that you get with that natural leather construction overall they feel really responsive and fun to play in there's just a couple notes that I would have about areas that I would improve first off the lacing system is a little bit on the bulkier side the laces are a little bit bigger than on most other shoes and the fold over tongue is pretty long so I feel like occasionally it's just not that minimal and I wish there was just less going on throughout the centralized lacing system and this would just give me a better feel when I was just juggling or kicking the ball with the top of my foot also the gum sole here does feel pretty rigid and in my opinion I think it could actually be a little bit thinner just because in its current state it does feel a little bit on the bulkier side when you're trying to get quick turns in that being said the gum Sole still does offer plenty of grip especially after owning these boots for so long so finally what I actually recommend someone get a pair of the Adidas sambas well ultimately I would say that that depends on what you're looking for in your shoe if you want a leather shoe that's comfortable durable and also good for casual settings I would say you should go for them and I also think that a 90 price tag for a shoe of this quality is actually a pretty fair deal as well but if you're looking for something more modern minimal and light something like the Nike react gato might be more along the lines of what you want personally I just think that they're a great shoe to have in your locker because not only are they nice for playing in but they're also versatile and can be used for just wearing casually so that pretty much does it for this video let me know if you have a pair of these classic shoes and what you think of them thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video,2025-06-19 08:41:01.428120 UTC
tuX_2mZPCiQ,New Balance 990,there's two different ways to clap there's the that clap and then there's the re like you turn them this way and really get in there into the Palm that's that's a power clap for sure that's like I mean just resounding noise hello and welcome to the workshop thank you for stopping by thank you for gracing us with your presence we appreciate you for stopping by if you are into sneakers then you have come to the right place consider subscribing we upload a lot of sneaker videos we talk a lot of sneakers around here buckets Define a lot almost every single day almost every single day so it is a lot of sneakers you can also find me on Twitter Instagram and Tick Tock when I am not here I am over on those other platforms last thing I want to mention before we dive into the sneakers which I am very excited about buckets I'm just lobbing that out there very excited me too before we dive into those I want to talk about this t-shirt that I'm currently wearing it is the uncivilized icarumba t-shirt available right now in very limited quantities on uncivilizedore.com we will put a link in the description of this video for your convenience buckets who is behind the camera myself we have a clothing brand that is where we sell it this t-shirt was entirely made in the USA made with love got a front graphic a back graphic buckets the finest of qualities very good the most Immaculate of craftsmanships for sure there you go um you got anything to add we dive into the sneakers because I see you got your eyes on my sneakers stay away I mean I'm chilling all right stay chilling three two one bang bang this is the New Balance 990 V6 these released pretty recently and are still available for anyone who's interested and the retail price is 200 bucks yes these are a Classics classic man I mean I have become a full-blown 990 lover full disclosure I really think you could argue it is the greatest sneaker ever made I mean that bucket that's not hyperbole I really mean that we've talked about it before in previous videos but for all day Comfort all day wear I really haven't found anything better you know a question I don't know if you get this question buckets I do but it's like if you were stranded on a desert island or if your house was burning down you could only grab one pair if the zombie apocalypse was imminent what sneaker do you grab to do your you know zombie Kung Fu okay I think you could argue it might be a pair of 990s because whether you had to Sprint perform some sort of athletic Maneuvers or if you're you know just trying to get a little Saucy I'm not sure how many public functions there would be during a zombie apocalypse but if that did arise you'd be ready you could still get fresh and I like that yeah don't get me wrong I love the Jordan one I love the Air Max 90s there are so many sneakers the Air Force One there are so many that I enjoy and that deserve to kind of be at that Pinnacle or on that upper echelon of sneakers but I do think the 990 is that good and you know that's new balance's whole Spiel with the 990 is the sneaker's so good we never stopped making it makes sense it really does and this is the latest iteration if you will the V6 and I think it's really dope first impression move to Bella they do look pretty similar to the other 990s they're predecessors well not so much with the original 990 and the V2 those had a more vintage look they were made a long time ago but these aren't that much different than the other 990 versions aesthetically maybe a tad more sporty just a little bit a little bit more of a performance look you've got a chunkier midsole as you can see that's probably the biggest change but the overall look kind of Remains the Same you've got a reflective New Balance logo right here in the middle probably the flashiest part of the sneaker and that's the thing with these right it is such a subtle unassuming sneaker especially in this classic all gray colorway you've got a little bit more 3M on the front a little bit on the ankle 990 branding underneath that rubber hit on the heel New Balance logo made in the USA beautiful gray suede wrapping around the sneaker just absolutely lovely to the touch you have it on the I stay as well standard white laces there is also a gray pair if you want to go full grayscale mode you can do that you've got a shorter darker gray Nubuck to complement that premium suede buckets by the way I don't know if it's nubuck just feels like it yeah and it makes me feel more expert for sure and the rest of the sneaker is pretty much this gray mesh that you see it's a little bit different towards the top of the tongue and then you've got the New Balance 990 V6 front and center white and gray midsole again you do see how chunky it is which is a change from the previous few versions pretty normal looking outsole nothing too fancy they Incorporated the different colors but very straightforward I think this sneaker is a work of art I really do it just feels like buckets it feels like a sneaker sneaker like if your sneaker were to wear sneakers it would be these I agree I totally share what that means but kind of seems like it hits I get it you get to So I says to the guy who's got the freaking gabagool you know what I mean so uh these are a 10 out of 10. they always were they always will be we we will certainly do a life test on these a full update video Pros cons everything in between just a heads up they do run about a half size big if you're not used to New Balance if you wear a lot of Nikes a lot of Air Maxes Kobe's Etc these do fit about a half size bag I love them I'm not going to speak too much to the Comfort yet although right out of the box they feel like previous 990s very very comfortable but we got to break them in we got to live life in them buckets The Gauntlet that is life word to Claude and Ray raised Boom Boom Room The Upper Room classic movie by the way classic sneaker classic movie thoughts on these I know you like them 10 out of 10. and the thing is you weren't always a 990 guy no about four years ago you were trying to put him on your top five most comfortable list and I was adamant I was really against it but but they are they're cozy now you're wearing a pair right now what do you got the v4s yeah I got the v4s I wear the v-force that's my daily sneaker the V4 yeah so you have become a new balance guy I love the 990. damn supermodels in London and dads in Ohio is that is that the slogan that's a slogan that's a slogan 10 out of 10. we agree we do we definitely do and like I said I do think as far as a silhouette goes as far as a model of sneaker goes You could argue that these are at the top of the list let us know how you feel leave a comment below thoughts feelings emotions do you own a pair if you want to own a pair are you totally out on New Balance I know they don't have a swoosh on the side I know but leave a comment below let us know how you feel thank you for watching you are very very appreciated we will be back tomorrow Manana same time same place right here the workshop with the brand news I got nothing else buckets anything to add no I don't think I have

GlqA2-uJxZE,New Balance 2002R,these 2002r from New Balance is so good but there is no such thing as a perfect sneaker here are three reasons why you should save your money and avoid the newbalance 2002r the first reason is that this sneaker originally debuted in 2010 as a high performance Runner but if you're looking for a high performance Runner now I would look elsewhere as there is better technology the second reason is that the suede paneled sneaker is durable and comfortable to wear but it is going to be a bit more delicate and it'll be tougher to upkeep especially after the rain the last reason is due to the current trend of panel sty sneakers if you're looking for a sneaker that will help you stand out then the 2002r will unfortunately fail you however the new balance 9060 and the 327s would be a better alternative even with these cons I would definitely recommend,2025-06-23 14:45:43.732957 UTC
E2eWfl91gbI,Adidas Samba,these are the brand new Adidas Sambar Luxe golf shoes that I bought in the UK for £100 so in this video I'm going to let you know how they fit feel and how they perform but first of all in terms of the look and the style personally I'm a big fan of these they've got that classic 80s retro sambber look in fact were the Sambas actually from the ' 70s might have been from the ' 70s i'm pretty sure I've got a picture of my dad wearing a pair of sambers in the 80s riding a donkey in Benadorm legend status there dad you've got a lovely little bit of gold lettering there in the sambar now I've gone for the green with the lighter gum sole but there's actually quite a few options that you've got with these the little bit of rippling on the stitching at the heel you've got the suede tongue at the front which probably isn't going to be great for golf you're probably going to end up getting a few stains on those so definitely recommend spraying some protector spray on those if you've got it but either way I don't think that's necessarily going to save them and then you've got the classic longer tongue there again with the kind of rippled stitching on the tongue these look lovely if you're looking for a pair of casual shoes that you can absolutely wear off the course and maybe wear on the course as well then I think these are probably going to have you covered are they going to be the best golf shoes that you can wear absolutely not these are pretty casual spikeless outsole here has got a good amount of grip on it so I didn't have any problems wearing these off of the course and there is some element of traction that you're going to get on the course because you can see here you've got all these raised nubs going in different directions but they're not going to give you the most amount of traction in terms of sizing as with most Adidash shoes I find that I have to go up half a size and I did with these as well so usually in Nike or general shoe size I'm a nine a UK nine and in these I've gone UK 9 and a half i bought a size N and I had to swap them out they were just too tight on the end of my toes one other thing that you might want to know with these in terms of the fit is that they do have a slightly raised arch on the inside now I struggle with shoes that have too much of a high arch because although I've got a high instep it's quite shallow and so if a shoe has a high arch then actually it hurts my feet and my toes end up going numb and I can't deal with them with these I was worried that I was going to have that problem but after I wore them for the first time they were actually okay so yes I can certainly feel that they've got a slightly raised arch on the inside but it's not that pronounced in terms of the comfort of these shoes I've actually been really quite impressed there's not the greatest deal of padding around the heel and the ankle and there's no padding really on the tongue but I haven't had any blisters or rubbing or anything like that you've got I would say a regular amount of room in the toe box here it's not the widest toe box but it's not too narrow either it's just kind of regular feeling and I was a little bit worried that this higher tongue almost kind of like an exaggerated tongue if you see it there was going to give me some rubbing or cause me some issues but I'm pleased to say I haven't actually had any problems with this tongue it does feel a little bit weird compared to maybe other trainers because that is a high tongue but I didn't have any problems with it now if you want to keep up to date with the latest and best online golf deals then make sure you sign up to my free monthly golf deals newsletter i've included a link down in the description below in terms of comfort underfoot these are perfectly comfortable but they're not particularly comfortable there's no special foam in here you haven't got any Adidas boost or anything like that so if you're going to compare them to the more comfortable trainers that you can buy these are going to feel quite firm not a problem they're not uncomfortable to walk 18 holes in but they're certainly not the softest ride underfoot and in terms of using these for golf because they are golf shoes they've got not the greatest deal of kind of rigidity or stability to them there so yeah if you really really want a pair of high performance golf shoes that's not going to twist and rotate and is going to give you the absolute maximum in terms of stability and energy return then these aren't it however if you're looking for a casual looking and in my opinion quite stylish looking pair of golf shoes that you're easily going to be able to wear off the course and then wear on the course for a casual round or certainly down the range then I think the Sambas are going to have you covered if you like the look of these shoes I did my full waterproof test and I poured 100 ml of water over the upper on the toe as well as the bottom section of the tongue and as you can see here no water penetrated the upper although some water will get through on that tongue section so if you are going to be using these in really heavy wet conditions then your feet are probably going to get a little bit wet however with the look of these shoes and the fact that you've got this suede section on the toe box I don't think many people are really going to be using these shoes out in heavy wet conditions anyway i like the fact that these shoes have a leather upper on them as well and it is reasonably soft certainly not the softest leather I've ever felt but wearing them out on the course and wearing them out to work to be honest I've actually worn these as just casual trainers they have felt nice and comfortable above the toes so if you're thinking about buying a pair of these and I have included any affiliate links down in the description below overall I'm a big fan of the look and the style of these shoes and if you're looking for a casual pair of shoes that you can wear on the course if you want to then these are going to do the trick especially if you really like the look of them as much as I do would I wear these in a competition no absolutely not personally I want a golf shoe with a bit more structure a little bit more traction something I'm going to have a little bit more faith in so for example something like the Adidas Code Chaos so yes the Code Chaos is retailing for I think around30 more but you're getting much more comfort and softness under foot these are a real soft ride i'd say actually they're a slightly wider fit across the toe so you're getting a little bit more room in your shoe and if you look at the outsole of these two shoes well there's no comparison really the Code Chaos has got a far more aggressive traction system you've also got a TPU plate in the middle whereas on this you've just got a standard flat cup gum sole so in terms of spikeless performance out on the golf course there is no competition if that's what you're looking for I'd certainly recommend going for something a little bit more golf focused like the Code Chaos rather than the Sambas which are going to be a little bit more casual focused love to know what you think of these shoes down in the comments if you found this video helpful please tap the like and subscribe button and if you are interested in learning more about the Code Chaos then I've included a link to my full review of these shoes right,2025-06-19 08:41:03.366852 UTC
idWxEudHqCQ,New Balance 990,these are the most comfortable shoes I've ever put on my feet what's up guys today we are talking about the New Balance 990 v6s in the Navy cream colorway I'm going to talk about the sizing the versatility the comfort and my overall thoughts on the shoe show you what it looks like on foot let's roll into the video so first and most importantly is the size I am usually a size 11. what's really nice about these shoes is that they really do fit true to size especially if you're somebody who has a bigger fatter foot like me I really like the fact that these really feel nice on my foot for longer walks the footbed is pretty wide it's not overly wide but it's just perfect for my feet to wrap up the sizing definitely go true to size and I think you'll be happy with the results now let's talk about the comfort of the shoe which is probably my favorite thing about these shoes I think the the dads out there that were rocking these from way before when they were cool were onto something because these are the most comfortable shoes I've ever put on my feet like I said with the sizing they have a nice wide footbed and they just sit so nicely now obviously the comfort is added on by the mesh right that adds so much breathability to the shoe a few weeks ago I went for a long walk and it was 28 or 29 it's almost 30 degrees out I was wearing long socks just like these and because of the meshing I had so much airflow that my feet weren't sweaty or hot at all and I think that's really important when you're looking for you know a nice lifestyle walking everyday type shoe there's a lot of extra padding down by the heel here just to make sure that you're not getting any chafing if you're enjoying the video so far please take two seconds to like And subscribe it makes such a big difference for the videos and my channel to grow and I would really appreciate it thanks so much this does have fuel cell in it which is one of their running materials they have on their other shoes the bonus to that is just the comfort that it adds when you're walking is is amazing they just feel really good they feel lightweight and breathable and spongy and firm it's just like the perfect mix of the sportiness you'd want from running shoe but also the the bonuses of having more of an everyday kind of Lifestyle shoe so you know definite 10 out of 10 with Comfort like I said the most comfortable shoe I own to date now let's talk about the versatility of the shoe these are technically running shoes now I don't run in them I haven't tried it I don't really want to to be honest these for me are a lifestyle shoe an everyday shoe you could definitely wear them to the gym now they do have a little curve to them however when you put your foot in they do feel nice and planted and flat and that's the reason why I say you could definitely wear these to the gym especially if you're not doing legs but even doing legs you're still going to be pretty planted and balanced so given that that's why I don't want to run in them because my running shoes are very curved and very narrow they're more of a speed shoe and you know for me these are just everyday walking errands all that kind of stuff right even the materials on the shoe don't really scream you know performance to me it's more of a everyday kind of relax wear sure there are people who run in them I don't really know many people in the running Community who are running in these shoes as per versatility I think the fact that they're a good walking shoe they're a stylish shoe you can dress them up plus you you can wear them in the gym I would give them you know an eight to nine out of ten for versatility now my overall thoughts on the shoe I guess the question is you know are these gonna be a good long-term buy it's a tough question because I do think fashion in general is going to a more athletic athleisure kind of vibe I think the whole like Street Wear you know New Balance 550s I feel like that's kind of died out you know this kind of style has kind of come in more over the last year or so but just as quick as something comes in it can come out I do think this is a pretty Timeless look I don't think it's you know overly boxy or wide or oversized I think I'll be wanting to wear these just because of how comfortable they are they just feel so good on foot so I think I'm Gonna Get Along long-term wear out of them I feel like you know the dad shoes like this dads have always worn them they've always kind of been there and they've always kind of been popular in that community and and now it's just blown up to another level I could be wrong and maybe in two years you're gonna look like an idiot wearing New Balances and you're gonna look way out of style but you know at the end of the day the silhouette is pretty clean the colorway is pretty clean it'll be interesting to see if these are still super sought after in a couple years or if they're going to be discounted 40 off on the shelves because nobody wants them overall thoughts on the shoe super comfortable really nice to wear they're pretty stylish they look better on foot too than they do just in my hand in my opinion try them out guys if you're looking for something that's gonna kind of fit the the realm of what I just talked about I think this is a really great option and they look good they feel good and you can't really go wrong so that's it for today's video guys I hope you enjoyed it I hope you got some info that you were looking for in regards to the 90s if you have any additional questions drop them below or message me on Instagram everything is linked down there I will see you guys in the next video peace,2025-06-23 14:42:43.940544 UTC

FBqcOdlhuXg,on cloudmonster 2,these are the top 10 on sneakers of 2024 that you can grab right now over the last couple months I've been totally immersing myself in the on world it's a brand that I wasn't too familiar with a year ago but the more that I've been wearing the shoes and trying them out the more I've been really falling in love with them in fact for shoes like this Theon Cloud tilt I paid $200 which is like $50 over retail cuz it was sold out so in today's video I'm counting down my top 10 favorite pairs of on sneakers that you can grab right now and of course if you want to grab any of these sneakers I've made sure to link them all through the YouTube shopping tab on your screen I do actually want to give an a huge thank you because they did provide some of the sneakers for this video I didn't have all 10 and I reached out to them and I said hey I'm doing a top 10 on video would you guys provide some sneakers and they did that said this is not in any way a sponsored video this is all completely my own personal opinion they didn't tell me to say anything about any of these shoes I just said hey I would like these shoes can you send them to me and they did so huge thank you to an for being so cool about it but hey with that being said let's dive straight into the list number 10 the oncloud 5 this shoe is one of an's most popular models that they've ever made the oncloud 5 is an everyday casual sneaker with a very unique aesthetic because of that cloudtech in the midsole speaking of cloudtech if you're not familiar cloudtech is essentially the punch outs through the midsole of the shoe which I believe is proprietary to on these punch outs or channels that basically go all the way through the bottom of the shoe allow for really nice crumple zones underneath your foot and give you a really nice almost cloud-like feel which is why most of their shoes have cloud in the name when it comes to the actual foam used in the mids soil of the oncloud 5 it's zero gravity foam which is relatively soft underfoot but it's nothing compared to some of the Foams that we'll talk about later on in the list specifically number one number one is just stupid comfortable in in addition to the cloud Tech in the midsole you've also got a speed board to prevent some torsional twisting and give you a bit more stability when you're wearing this shoe then moving up on the shoe you've got antimicrobial mesh and taped reinforcements and the upper itself is also pretty well padded especially around the heel the oncloud 5 doesn't feature standard laces instead you've got sort of a bungee cord system which allows this shoe to be kind of like a slip-on and overall it's a pretty basic but still pretty comfortable shoe it retails for 140 bucks and fits true to size stylistically I don't love the way this sneaker looks that's why it's lower on the list it does look better on foot but I definitely prer the Aesthetics to some of the other shoes on the list a lot more number nine the on cloud boom strike over the last few years the category of ultra high-end super high tech Marathon running sneakers has been exploding into the consumer Market almost $300 sneakers that are designed specifically for race day and really only for race day and the cloud boom strike is one of those sneakers it comes in at a retail price of $280 which Yes sounds like a lot but when you compare it to the other offerings from Nike and aditus it's right in line in fact I think Nikes is like 285 so it's a little bit cheaper that said for the $28 price point you were getting like the top-of-the-line Tech that on makes the shoe features a super thin and Ultra lightweight mesh upper which you can actually see almost all the way through it's very breathable it molds to your foot and to I mention it's ridiculously lightweight there is a tiny bit of padding around the heel area of the shoe which is pretty standard for these types of shoes and then you do have a pretty thick insole as well however where this shoe really shines is the midsole underneath the insole that I just showed you which apparently on calls the cushioned bounce board interesting name to call an insole you've got a carbon fiber speedboard now most Ultra high-end Marathon running sneakers do feature some kind of plate in the shoe to help bounce you into the next step and in this case I mean it really does literally spring you into the next step you kind of put some pressure down on it and you bounce forward it's crazy underneath that plate you've got what an calls helon HF hyper foam which is their softest and probably most expensive foam this foam is ridiculously soft and ridiculously bouncy it is similar to the offerings from Nike and Adidas and unfortunately like those shoes it is only rated for a couple hundred miles versus you know other more standard Foams because of how soft it is but man does it feel good under her feet obviously because this is an on sneaker it does feature Cloud Tech in the heel which you can't actually see through like other on cloud Tech but it does provide a little bit more cushion a little bit more crumple Zone and seriously this shoe is just ridiculously lightweight on says that it's 29 kg plus visually I really like the way that this sneaker looks the fade from like the white to the blue to the red is fire just the shape of the shoe is very clean they did a great job it looks awesome in case you forgot yes this shoe is $280 but it does fit your to size and again the reason it's so expensive is because it features just the top-of-the-line Tech realistically this is a shoe that most people aren't going to buy this is a shoe designed specifically for runners who are running races and that's about it that said it is crazy soft underfoot number eight the on Roger Pro 2 so this shoe is specifically made for Hardcore Tennis yes I guess you could wear it for just general lifestyle wear but mainly it's for tennis but I got to say it's a pretty decent looking pair of tennis shoes now it does look very different than really any of the other on sneakers that we're going to talk about in today's list because it doesn't feature cloudtech that said it still got a lot of on brand branding and I really like it a lot actually so the Roger Pro 2 features an ultra lightweight and abrasion resistant upper which is actually also pretty breathable and I love the fact that it's semi-translucent too you can actually see through it to your socks and hey if you're wearing dope socks with Apothecary socks that's a good thing there's a bunch of padding around the heel of the shoe which is great you've also got some nice padding on the tongue and the midsole of the sneaker also comes with some high performance foam for impact protection now let's be real underfoot it's not going to be as soft as really any of the other sneakers on this list but it's a great purpose-built tennis shoe one of the main features on this shoe is the wide Herring bone traction pack P which allows for a lot of multi-directional grip Herring bone is actually one of the better traction patterns that you can have because of its multi-directional nature and for stability you've got a 100% carbon fiber speed plate which you can see here on the bottom of the shoe which really helps make this shoe feel a lot more stable now I don't play a lot of tennis I haven't played tennis in a minute I did used to play tennis but uh this is a shoe that as soon as I can get back to the tennis courts I'm going to rock because this shoe is actually fire especially in this pink color way I kind of dig this when it comes to fit the Roger Pro to fits true to size and it comes in at a retail price of $200 which yes is pricey but you are getting a pretty high-end tennis shoe number seven the on cloud pulse the cloud pulse was made to be a gym and training sneaker specifically designed for stability and flexibility and I will say it is pretty stable and pretty flexible so they pretty much accomplished exactly what they were trying to do the cloud pulse features a reinforced mesh upper which is pretty comfortable on foot and relatively breathable it's also very nicely padded around the back half of the sneaker and one thing I really appreciate about it is that it really does a good job of keeping your foot locked in place like it's a great shoe for lateral movements something else that really helps the lateral stability is this speed board which you can see through this groove in the bottom of the sneaker and is kind of set between your foot and the midsole of the sneaker it also provides a little bit more stability especially on those lateral movements it seems like it's meant to prevent torsional twisting which is a good thing the midsole of the sneaker is made up of helon super foam and features your Cloud Tech so it is pretty comfortable underfoot definitely not as pillowy as some other shoes that we'll talk about later on in the list but it does do a nice job of giving you some impact protection and providing some energy return the cloud pulse comes in at a retail price of 150 bucks and fits true to size so hey if you're out there looking for new gym sneaker this is not a bad way to go obviously Comfort is really important when picking a new pair of shoes whether it's running sneakers walking sneakers training sneakers it does not matter Comfort is important and one way to increase the comfort of your sneakers is to add a very comfortable pair of socks like a pair of Apothecary socks I co-founded Apothecary back in 2020 to create your sneakers favorite socks and I think we've done a pretty good job Apothecary socks are not only breathable and look great but they're also incredibly comfortable on foot and this Friday October 4th we're launching a brand new collection of socks in partnership with keeper breast foundation for breast cancer awareness month for every sock that we sell from this partnership $5 will go to the keep a breast foundation so not only are you getting a good-looking very comfortable pair of socks you're also supporting a good cause I lost my mom to breast cancer in 2016 so this is a cause that is near and dear to my heart so if you guys want to grab any socks from this collection they drop October 4th number six the en Cloud Nova 2 this shoe is one of On's everyday all day walking sneakers and while it's not my favorite one that they make it is a solid choice and it feels great underfoot the shoe features a textile upper which is pretty comfortable and pretty well paded all the way around the upper of the shoe especially around the heel of of the shoe you've got this nice heel pillow which I like a lot on the back half of the shoe pretty much directly right underneath your foot you've got a speed board which is like a thick plastic board for added stability you can actually see it through this groove on the bottom of the sneaker it also apparently connects to this heel clip right here it's made of the same TPU material for that added sort of heal support and lock down the midsole is made up of 50% bio attributed zero gravity foam which is pretty soft under fooot and then of course you've got your Cloud Tech which you can see all the way through compared to some of the other shoes on this list and some of the other shoes that on makes it's a bit on the firmer side especially when you compare it to like helon super foam or something like that but it's still a very comfortable on foot experience it's very stable which I appreciate and it fits true to size Cloud Nova 2 comes in at a retail price of $160 and if there is one thing that I change about it it might be the overall Aesthetics I don't love the way it looks it's a little bit basic for me but not a bad looking sneaker just not exactly my style number five The oncloud Horizon the cloud Horizon is a really well- cushioned hiking shoe the shoe comes with a very supportive and well structured upper it's durable it's going to protect you against sticks and twigs and rocks and whatever you have kind of bumping into or rubbing against the side of your foot it's also pretty nicely padded around the entire upper of the shoe obviously most of the padding will be towards the heel of the shoe but you've also got some nice padding in the toe area now that padding does come at the expense of some breathability that said from hiking shoes I don't know if breathability is always the main focus and it's still a relatively breathable shoe it's just not as breathable as some of their running sneakers but in my opinion the best part about the cloud Horizon is the midsole and the out soole but let's start things off on the bottom of the shoe first you've got this Mission grip rubber outsole which has these nice thick lugs which really dig into the ground well Mission grip is also great for grip as you probably could guessed from the name of mission grip itself it's a very grippy rubber compound traction is obviously one of the main focuses of this shoe and it does a good job of keeping you in place then you get up to the cloudtech phase midsole with Helen super foam it's incredibly soft underfoot to me this midsole feels similar to the cloud Surfer which we'll talk about in a little bit it's not as soft as that shoe I don't think at least I didn't notice it to be but it's still very soft underfoot probably the softest hiking shoe that I've ever worn now unlike a lot of an's other sneakers this shoe is definitely more of a walking shoe than a running shoe there are some trail running shoes on this list which we'll get to but if you're looking for a solid comfortable hiking sneaker this is a great way to go and when it comes to sizing I would say that this shoe does fit pretty much sure to size as for the price it is a bit more expensive coming in at $170 especially when compared to some other hiking shoes on the market but it does feel amazing underfoot it is a high quality hiking shoe so I still recommend it even at that price on does also have a waterproof version of the shoe which comes in at $190 so it is $20 more expensive and it won't be as breathable but if you do plan to be hiking in very wet conditions or rainy conditions then that might be a good way to go number four the oncloud surfer and Cloud Surfer Trail so the shoe that I'm holding is specifically the oncloud surfer Trail it is a trail running sneaker based off of the classic on cloud Surfer the cloud Surfer is sort of ons everyday do everything running sneaker and the cloud Surfer Trail is essentially that with the trail outsole and some other minor modifications regardless both shoes are great and both shoes at the same price 160 bucks actually to be fair they both also fit the same they're both true to size the cloud Surfer Trail is essentially a trail running version of the shoe it's got bigger lugs that help grip a little bit better when you're running through muddy or wetter conditions there is a slight difference in the shape of the back of the shoe it's nothing major but to me when I wore them both they both felt pretty much the same the cloud Surfer comes with an engineered mesh upper that does have a backing so it's not as breathable as some of the other shoes on the list however it is still pretty breathable on foot the heel area has some nice padding you've also got some nice structure there so there's not going to be any heel slippage and fitwise like I said before the upper of the shoe is pretty standard it's not going to blow you away it's not the most breathable or lightest upper in the world or even softest upper in the world but it does everything that you need to do really well the bottom half though is where this sneaker really shines you've got your cloudtech phase midsole with hel and super foam it's soft and comfortable Under Foot it's responsive it's not going to be too cushy for you to where you feel like you're kind of sinking into the shoe but at the same time you get a lot of impact protection and some nice bounce for me personally if I was looking for an everyday Workhorse running sneaker the cloud Surfer is the way that I would go it's simple it's clean it gets the job done and you feel good doing it if I was to compare this to a pair of Nike running sneakers I'd probably compare this to like the Nike Pegasus 41 it's a similar category of sneakers plus the cloud Surfer also comes in a trail version so if you're looking for a trail running shoe definitely recommend it and of course you can grab this shoe right now through the YouTube shopping tab on your screen it's light it's soft it doesn't have a plate which probably makes this shoe a little bit cheaper and also if you don't like plates you're probably going to prefer this shoe I love the cloud Surfer it's a great everyday running shoe number three the oncloud eclipse this is on softest most Max cushion Max cushion sneaker that they make this shoe is ridiculously soft under feet it's also one of their newer models that was introduced over the last year or so and it looks pretty decent the upper of the shoe is made up of an engineered mesh which is very breathable and pretty soft you've got some decent padding around the heel area of the shoe but where the shoe really shines is the midsole I mean at first glance you can see how ridiculously thick this midsole is this is a thick boy and it feels thick under feet so you've got a cloud Tech phase midsole with helium super foam that compresses so well under feet the foam is super soft and of course these channels in the midsole crumple really really nicely which give you even more cushion this shoe also features a nylon speedboard for torsional twisting and stability however unlike the next shoe that we're going to talk which is also a Max cushion sneaker the speedboard is on the bottom of the shoe and not in between the upper and the mids soole so while it doesn't offer the same sort of bounciness or energy return that it would if it was higher up in the midsole of the shoe it does offer some nice twist resistance and stability which I appreciate but for me the biggest benefit of the plate being on the bottom of the shoe rather than in the middle of the shoe is that your foot is just right on top of that crazy soft foam so you feel the cushion even more than you would in other sneakers that have a plate in between your foot and the foam so not only does this shoe just feature the most foam that I've seen in any on sneaker it also allows your foot to be right on top of that foam so you really get the most softness Under Foot it feels incredible that is if you like super soft Max cushion sneakers if you don't then maybe this isn't the shoe for you but I do when it comes to fit it's true to size and it's priced at $180 number two the oncloud monster 2 this is another Max cushion option from on however unlike the cloud eclipse this shoe is designed to be a bit faster the cloud monster 2 not only offers you Max cushion but also on says Max Energy return and for the past couple weeks wearing this shoe casually and for runs I've got to say I'm pretty impressed by it and this is probably my my favorite Max cushion shoe that they make yes the cloud eclipse is softer underfoot but when it comes to Everyday runs I definitely prefer this shoe cuz it feels like it's balancing you into the next step the upper of this shoe is engineered mesh and made up of recycled polyester it's pretty lightweight and pretty breathable you've got some really nice and thick padding around the back of your foot which helps with heel slippage and also just cushioning inside this shoe somewhere between the upper of the shoe and the midsole of the shoe you've got a nylon blend speedboard what this speed board does is help snap you into the next step it gives you a bit more stability and support and makes this a much bouncier ride but my favorite part of the en Cloud monster 2 which is probably everyone's favorite part because it's a Max cushion sneaker is of course the cushioning this shoe features what on calls monster Cloud Tech you've got dual density helon super foam which is incredibly soft underfoot and then you've also got the biggest cloud Tech that they've ever put in a shoe and I mean to be fair it is Big you can see through it all the way pretty easily and man does it feel soft underfoot it compresses so well and it really does bounce you into the next step I really love running in this shoe because it's great for Recovery runs it's very soft underfoot but it's also great for longer softer slower runs and the speed plate really does help with the forward momentum seriously an awesome shoe now when it comes to sizing an actually recommends going a half size down I grabbed this shoe in my true size and it was fine I didn't have any issues but I do understand how some people would want to go a half size down I think if you're a wider footer it might not hurt to go true to size but sometimes it is just better to do what an actually recommends themselves and they say go down half a size so I'll say the same thing although I'm fine in the true to size pair personally pricing wise this shoe comes in at a bit of a higher-end price point of $180 which isn't terrible it's comparable to prices from other brands like Nike and Adidas but it is a higher-end running sneaker so you can expect to pay a higher-end price the one thing I don't love about this shoe is just the overall Aesthetics I think it's one of the less pretty on running sneakers I'll say that but I mainly only wear the shoe for run so it doesn't bother me that much and I think for most people it's probably fine I'm just kind of a snob when it comes to sneaker Aesthetics number one the oncloud Tilt this shoe has become my everyday go-to sneaker it's very lightweight it feels amazing on feet and the cushion is ridiculous so the cloud tilt unlike a lot of the other shoes on this list is not designed for running it's actually specifically designed for casual wear that said you can still run in this shoe if you want I think there's better options for running on this list but it's not like you can't run in this shoe but seriously this shoe is an incredible everyday sneaker first of all visually it's really clean this colorway is probably the most popular colorway the white fading to Black colorway which is also the color that we've seen Zena wear in some of On's promo materials and even though it's not technically Zena's signature sneaker it is kind of the shoe tied to Zena but visually I'd say that this shoe is pretty striking the upper is clean and simple but it does have a nice pop to it the midsole obviously comes with a cloudtech phase that features a cutouts which gives it this very unique look like all of On's other sneakers and not only does it look good it's also incredibly comfortable the upper of the shoe is made up of recycled polyester and is very lightweight and pretty breathable you've got some decent padding around the heel area the tongue is relatively well padded and one of my favorite features on this shoe which is not unique to this particular silhouette is the lacing system it's not your standard lacing system even though it looks like it could be it's much more of a slip-on construction because the laces are tied off at the end so you can't actually tie them they're bungee laces so they give you a lot of stretch you also have a separate tongue which allows for some more fit customizability but what this really does is make this much more of a slip-on than anything else so you get the slip-on feel and the slip-on Comfort without the style of a slip-on because a lot of people just don't like the way the slip-ons look you can pretty much put the shoe on with no hands just slide your feet in keep it by the door go to the store whatever you need to do then pull it off it's a very versatile sneaker like I've already mentioned it features the cloudtech phase cushioning in the mids soil which makes it very soft underfoot it's not as soft as something like the cloud Eclipse which is like a Max cushion sneaker but it's great for everyday wear especially just walking around when it comes to sizing the oncloud Tilt fits true to size and pricing wise this shoe comes in at 160 bucks for me this is my favorite overall on sneaker it's an excellent all day casual sneaker it's very soft underfoot it's very lightweight it looks good and even though yes I love On's running sneakers and I wear those a lot I tend to wear casual shoes more than running sneakers and this is one of those shoes It just fits so well into my daily life it looks good it's super easy to rock but of course if you want to grab this pair or any of the other pairs that I talked about in today's video make sure to check them all out through the YouTube shopping tab on your screen let me know in the comments which one of these shoes You' like the best make sure to subscribe if you haven't yet and I'll see you all in the next

wk92kgauHrA,on cloudmonster 2,"these are the top 10 on sneakers that you should check out in 2025 has quietly become one of the top sneaker brands in the world and for good reason the Swiss brand has created not only some of the best running sneakers out there but also some of the most comfortable plus Cloudtech midsoles look different from anything else in the market now I can't lie i've always been a Nike Adidas and New Balance guy but over the last two or so years I've dived head first into the world of On and somewhat accidentally accumulated 25 plus pairs of On sneakers so because of that I put together a list of my top 10 favorite pairs that are available to grab from On right now this list is made up of performance running sneakers everyday lifestyle sneakers and some of the most comfortable shoes that I've ever worn you could say some of them are cloud-like cuz On Cloud sneakers are on cloud so it was a pun of course if you want to grab any of the sneakers that I talked about in today's video I've made sure to link them all through the YouTube shopping tab on your screen but hey if you still want to add some Jordans to your rotation I'm actually giving away a pair of the Nike SB Air Jordan 4 Navies and you can enter that giveaway by grabbing four core badges from my last couple videos over the last month and the fourth one is actually linked in the top of the description below but hey with all that out of the way let's dive right into it kicking off the list at number 10 we've got one of the best race day runners out there the Encloud Boom Strike now listen when people think of high performance running sneakers they usually go straight to the big players like Nike Adidas Hoka but AN has quietly been grinding and this year they did not miss the Cloud Boom Strike is hands down their most aggressive race focus silhouette yet this shoe was designed with marathon runners and serious racers in mind and it shows it's got a fulllength and full carbon speedboard underneath your foot right on top of the foam it's got this pretty wild rocker geometry and on signature Cloudtech foam that's been retuned for responsiveness over long distances it's incredibly light and it's fast and it also looks really fast i mean look at the sculpting on the midsole it's awesome now let's be real this is not your everyday trainer although the cushion and the ride are incredibly soft and bouncy it's not designed to be running every single day i mean the upper is super thin the midsole while incredibly soft is also kind of delicate the shoe itself is just more fragile than a daily trainer but hey if you're chasing a personal record at your next race or maybe you're a fan of cuttingedge sneaker technology the Cloud Boom Strike absolutely delivers so while this shoe might not be for everybody it does earn a spot at number 10 by pushing boundaries and proving on isn't just for casuals and coffee shop flexers anymore they're here to compete now the Cloud Boom Strikes come in at 280 bucks so they're obviously not cheap but that price is pretty much in line with similar offerings from Nike and Adidas and in terms of tech yeah also similar to Nike and Adidas I recommend checking these out coming in at number nine is the On Cloud Nova 2 the Cloud Nova 2 is all about lifestyle meets performance an's always had that ultra clean minimalist aesthetic but the Cloud Nova 2 takes it to a whole new level you've got that signature CloudTech midsole for comfort a wide stance for stability and a sleek futuristic upper that looks just as good with joggers or with shorts what I really like about the Cloud Nova 2 is that it's versatile you can wear it to the gym you can rock it around the city and it's comfortable enough to be your all-day travel shoe the upper is an engineered mesh with a sock-l like fit and the updated heel counter gives it more lock down than the first version and while it's not built for a marathon it still brings performance tech under the hood the nylon speedboard plate is toned down compared to AN's racing shoes like the one we just talked about but it's still there to give you a little pop on your stride this shoe is one of AN's do everything pairs of sneakers they're sleek they're comfortable and just techy enough to differentiate themselves from similarly priced $160 everyday sneakers with the running focus the Cloud Nova 2 earns its spot at number nine because it's one of those rare sneakers that truly blurs the line between style and substance whether you're rocking it casually or putting in a few light miles it just works at number eight is the OnCloud Zone this is An's latest everyday comfort sneaker it's less about morning runs and more about keeping you comfortable from your morning commute to your late night grocery run but hey don't get it twisted just because the shoe is more chill doesn't mean it's more basic the Cloud Zone brings a streamlined design that feels super modern but unmistakably on you've got that unmistakable OnCloud tech and of course that's paired with a layer of Helon Supero which makes it pretty soft underfoot in addition to that you've got a pretty no frills upper that seems to be mostly engineered mesh with some heat pressed overlays it's simple it's clean it's low-key but it still gives you that signature cloud ride underfoot for me what put the Cloud Zone this high on the list is because of its balance it's a sneaker that doesn't scream for attention but still turns heads and more importantly it's affordable well kind of affordable at 140 bucks more affordable than some of the other shoes coming up on this list i guess this shoe would be kind of considered one of's entry-level sneakers which is kind of nuts at 140 bucks but it's not a bad price it's not trying to change things up too much it's not trying to reinvent the wheel it's just trying to be a great everyday sneaker and in 2025 with so many brands chasing hype and gimmicks the Cloud Zone feels refreshingly simple so no matter what you're wearing the Cloud Zone for it's a great simple everyday wear that I definitely recommend and it's pretty comfortable underfoot which is pretty much all you can ask for coming in at number seven is the OnCloudRunner 2 now the original Cloudrunner was already a super solid daily trainer it was stable it was really comfortable and easy to wear for beginners and more experienced runners it was an all-around forgiving shoe it was comfortable and it was easy to run in but the Cloudrunner 2 takes an already good shoe and makes it even better of course you've got Helen Supero in the midsole which is the foam compound that makes up the midsole it's very soft and very responsive in addition to that you've got your Cloud Tech which are these holes that are punched through the midsole which also do a really nice job of adding some nice cushion from what I could tell the ride on this shoe felt a little bit smoother than the original Cloud Runner which is a good thing seemingly one of the bigger updates on this shoe is the upper itself it actually has a slightly more stretchy material on the upper i mean similar but it's slightly more stretchy so it's a bit more wideooter friendly plus it's now made of recycled materials which is always a win even though this shoe is called the Cloud Runner it's an incredibly versatile shoe it's great for running obviously but also just day-to-day lifestyle wear which is kind of the thing for a lot of these shoes but this one in particular it's not too overdone it's not too runner focused it's not too honestly ugly it's a great everyday pair of shoes it's easy to rock and it's great for like your morning runs and then wearing to the office plus it's priced at 150 bucks so it's pretty middle of the road and it doesn't break the bank so if you're looking for a comfortable stable and stylish daily trainer with legit performance chaps the CloudRunner 2 is a no-brainer and that's why it's number seven on the list sliding in at number six is the Encloud 6 now if you've been around the On ecosystem at all you already know that the OnCloud line is basically the brand's way of sucking you in and the sixth version of the shoe refineses everything that people loved about the original it's lightweight it's very comfortable for an everyday sneaker and it's ridiculously easy to throw on and wear anywhere for a lot of reasons one it looks like a shoe that you can throw on with anything but two it also has a sort of bungee lacing system which makes it a very slip-on friendly type of shoe the Cloud 6 keeps that everyday DNA but adds some nice upgrades first off the CloudTech midsole has been retuned to feel softer underfoot but still snappy but now with better impact protection the upper is made up of a relatively breathable mesh and the new heel area has better lock down which I appreciate some of the older versions I had some trouble with heel slipping this one seems fine got to be honest here I don't love the look of this shoe the cloud line has never been my favorite but a lot of people would disagree with me in fact I think this is like An's most popular sneaker and this is a shoe that I see on most people's feet so hey I'm probably wrong in this one but this one is not my favorite but just because I don't love the way a shoe looks doesn't mean it's a bad shoe i still think it's a great shoe overall actually let me know what your opinion is on the style of this shoe in the comment section down below i'd love to know like I mentioned before you've still got the speed loops that make this a very slip-on and slip offable kind of shoe which I love however if you're one of those people that prefers more traditional fit they do offer regular laces too which you can do but you got to try this this is cool now as I've said throughout this video and will continue to say throughout this video is that the reason the Cloud 6 are so good is because they're so versatile now unlike some of the other shoes that we talked about this is not really a running sneaker however you can wear it for light runs i would say this is a more casual shoe but the reason I think this $150 sneaker is so versatile is because you can wear it with pretty much anything it's got that sort of sporty vibe but also it can be dressed up in certain situations so for all of those reasons the OnCloud 6 takes the number six spot it's simple it's functional and I didn't actually put it at number six on purpose but I like the way that turned out at the number five spot we've got the shoe with the most appropriately named midsole the OnCloud Monster 2 if you've been following on for a while and you thought the first Cloud Monster was wild the sequel takes it up a notch this sneaker is all about max cushioning max bounce and straight up I'd say fun underfoot the Cloud Monster 2 takes one of their most plush and high stack running sneakers and makes it even better let's start with the foam on has updated the Helen super foam compound to be even softer and more responsive on this model and of course it's paired with an improved speedboard plate that gives the shoe a surprising amount of snap or really how bulky it looks it's kind of like you're running on a very soft trampoline and not in a weird gimmicky way it really does feel like that it's kind of amazing i would say that it's a bouncy boy additionally an gave this shoe the biggest Cloud Tech ever which if you didn't know Cloudtech is those holes in the midsole which we talked about earlier and while it's a max cushion runner don't sleep on the style factor it's weird it is a weird looking shoe and if you're into that you're going to love it i mean the Cloud Monster 2 has that exaggerated silhouette that looks wild and unique and I feel like it's one of those ugly duckling shoes like you really you start to fall in love with it after a while now I will keep it real though this is a lot of shoe if you like something more minimal and more low profile this is probably not the way to go but if you want a max cushioned super high stack cloud riding beast of a sneaker that somehow still feels light and energetic the Cloud Monster 2 is kind of that shoe for 180 bucks it's not cheap but in my opinion it's worth the price whether you're training for your next race or putting in long miles or just want a sneaker that turns you know the sidewalks near your house into trampolines this one is a monster of a pun uh in all the right ways speaking of comfort if you're looking for the comfiest socks out there Apothecary my sock brand has you covered apothecary makes socks that not only look great and come in a ton of different styles and colors but they also of course feel incredible on your feet seriously you got to try them they are super soft and they are very breathable especially because of our proprietary isoeave technology of course they fit great so make sure to check them out through apothecary.com linked in the description below and use my code Seth for $5 off of your first order again it is my sock brand and again that could all sound biased but genuinely they're amazing we spent years developing them try them out they're awesome coming in hot at number four we've got the On Cloud Surfer 2 now look the Cloud Surfer was already one of An's most I guess underrated daily sneakers but Cloud Surfer 2 it's different and not just because the shoe is a lot less underrated an ditched the Speedboard entirely and re-engineered this shoe from the ground up using their Cloudte Phase as you can see here it looks a little bit different than Cloud Tech it's basically a new hole pattern that collapses in a more natural way that helps push you into the next step it's actually really cool and surprisingly it does work and in my opinion Cloudtech Phase does deliver one of the smoothest rides that I've ever had from On this thing kind of feels buttery on foot i'm running out of ways to describe a cloud-like sneaker without saying cloud-like and buttery is the way that I went it's super lightweight the cushioning is soft without being mushy and it transitions beautifully from heel to toe really it feels amazing whether you're running or whether you're walking it's just a very well cushioned shoe and I'll be honest it looks sleek compared to some of the other chunkier ones like the Cloud Monster 2 the Cloud Surfer 2 is streamlined it's breathable and in my opinion it's really wearable so whether you're doing a tempo run or hitting the treadmill or just rocking them casually this shoe blends form and function perfectly another plus at least for some people is that it's relatively affordable at 160 bucks it's not cheap but compared to some of the other $160 running sneakers out there on the market from other brands i'd say it competes very well and it's one of the more reasonably priced sneakers in an lineup which makes it a great entry point into the brand if you want performance without breaking the bank it's an excellent everyday runner probably my favorite pair on the list for both running and casual wear in my opinion there's a lot of other really great shoes on the list that are really great at one thing or another like you can have a pair of shoes that's a great everyday lifestyle sneaker that you can run in and then there's shoes that are excellent running shoes that sure you can wear casually but this shoe is like right in the middle it's like a perfect mix of both of those things at number three it's the On Cloud Monster Void in a lot of ways this is sort of the comfort first lifestyle variant of the Cloud Monster that we just talked about let's start things off by talking about the ride underneath in the midsole it's still that Cloud Monster DNA high stack helium foam massive Cloud Tech pods and a speedboard that just gives you that springy energy return but what really sets the Void apart is the refined construction it's sleeker it's more well sculpted it's designed for that everyday comfort and the upper is where you get some of the biggest changes on ditch the typical mesh used on the Cloud Monster for a new more lightweight technical inspired mesh it's almost translucent in some colorways with very minimal branding on the lateral side it's just the on O right there whereas on the Cloud Monster 2 you get Cloud Monster kind of plastered on the side of the shoe that's not for me but this is pretty clean i mean this shoe is literally designed to be a more lifestyle version of the Cloud Monster 2 gives you all of that same max cushion but it gives you the wearable look for lifestyle which is a huge plus it's also $10 cheaper than the Cloud Monster 2 at 170 bucks taking the number two spot we've got the OnCloud Eclipse so the Cloud Eclipse at least from what I've tried is On's most cushioned pair it's crazy soft underfoot at the core of the Eclipse is the double layered Cloudtech phase midsole which on tune for ultra smooth transitions and plush comfort it's got that soft landing that responsive pushoff and a geometry that just feels like a rocker and I love it now the main difference between this shoe and something like the Cloud Monster which we talked about was an incredibly soft running sneaker is the fact that this puts the Speedboard on the bottom of the shoe rather than in between your foot and the foam so your foot is actually resting directly on top of the foam which means you get a much more plush underfoot feel on the Cloud Monster your foot's actually on top of the speedboard and then that's on top of the foam so while you still get a lot of the foam softness it's sort of dispersed across the speedboard whereas on this shoe you get all of it right underneath your foot now the speedboard doesn't do as much in this shoe like it doesn't spring you into the next step but it does help with some torsional twisting so that is a plus honestly I would take the softness underf foot any day over that springiness personally the upper is also breathable and lightweight with some pretty premium detailing no flashy logos no extra noise just a relatively clean purposeful construction it's also nicely padded so especially around the ankle you get that nice cushion that really sucks you in i love it the upper cushion is a perfect accent in my opinion to the soft midsole i love the way it feels and apparently there is a Cloud Eclipse coming later this year it might not be called the Eclipse 2 i'm not sure exactly what they're going with i saw rumors of it online i could be completely wrong but I would not be surprised if we see a Cloud Eclipse 2 coming later in 2025 now getting back to the Cloud Eclipse 1 which is actually available right now it comes in at $180 which does put it at the top of the range in terms of pricing but it truly is the softest pair of sneakers that On makes and it's an excellent choice for runners or people just looking for that everyday maximal cushion shoe whether you're running or you're walking it's one of those shoes you can throw on and it just feels amazing underfoot coming in at number one just like last year is the On Cloud Tilt the Cloud Tilt is one of AN's most lifestyle forward silhouettes to date and it absolutely crushed 2024 in fact it was the number one shoe on that list as well i mean this is a pair that blew up because of all those Zenaia ads and honestly it lives up to the hype at the heart of the Cloud Tilt is of course Cloud Tech Phase it's the same nextG tech that we saw in the Cloud Surfer and the Cloud Eclipse but here it's tuned for all day urban wear this is not a running shoe this is a lifestyle shoe and it feels awesome underfoot now again with that being said like I said earlier you can run in this shoe if you want but you're probably not going to be breaking any personal records in this shoe that's not the point this shoe is all about that sort of effortless comfort airy feeling smooth transitions and sock absorption that makes walking standing and traveling in many cases actually really enjoyable and then there's the design i think the shoe is the best looking pair of On sneakers ever made you've got this precision map knit that hugs your foot in all the right places while still staying breathable and flexible there's no overlays on this shoe no unnecessary panels i mean the Swiss are not about that they're about their minimalism and because of that this shoe is just a very comfortable very clean looking pair of sneakers it's also got that slip-on style lacing system which I mentioned earlier which in my opinion gives you the best of both worlds you get the look of having a laced up sneaker but you also get the ease of use of a slip-on which I love maybe it's cuz I'm getting older but this is like one of my favorite things in a pair of sneakers i know it's stupid but seriously try it and as a sneaker head I've noticed that this pair is crossing the line into more traditional sneaker culture i mean sure it's not hyped up like the latest Travis Scott collaboration but they have dropped some collabs on this shoe which did sell out it's also just becoming a go-to pair of sneakers for sneaker heads when they don't want to rock their Jordans or their latest collab shoes they throw on a pair of Ons and they're comfy and they look good now speaking personally here I have hundreds of pairs of sneakers and this is literally one of the three pairs that I keep by my door that will never drop out of my rotation i wear it everywhere on absolutely killed this shoe they truly bridge everyday style elite comfort and their performance DNA without sacrificing any part of the equation it's futuristic it's functional and it's honestly the kind of sneaker we're going to look back on as like ""Wow that was a gamecher."" And hey personally I think this is the best way to get into the ON ecosystem for 160 bucks it's middle of the road price but I do think it's absolutely worth every dollar but hey if you made it to this point in the video let me know in the comment section down below which one of these shoes you were into the most as always thank you so much for watching hit that subscribe button if you like the vid",2025-06-23 14:41:02.056603 UTC
wqZFzkALYt8,Air Jordan 1,these are the worst creasing sneakers ever does that make sense when it comes to sneakers for under 250 this is definitely one of them these are a close second let's check out how bad these actually crease first off hold on wait a second usually sneakers don't come with a dust bag like this but this is kind of cool it's not really a dust bag more of like a satchel let's get straight to the business ooh baby these are one of them all right the satin bread Air Jordan 1 these are sleepers let's see how bad they actually crease and these for those of you who don't know are a women's release so all the boys out there that are over a size 10 and 1 12 you can kiss these goodbye but luckily I can squeeze the 10 and 1 half barely all right let's see how bad these actually crease ooh baby oh no all right and after we just put these things to the test here's the result honestly I think everybody online is kind of tweaking about this it's not that big of a deal we busted this myth but honestly who cares about creases anyway,2025-06-19 08:40:07.596610 UTC
im9wNJ1KvkM,Adidas Samba,these shoes are probably older than your grandparents they were originally designed in 1949 and today they still cost a hundred dollars in this video we're gonna go over everything you need to know about the sambas and if they should be your next purchase in under five minutes I went with half size up not because that I read that they were too tight or anything like that they were just sold out in my size which is normally a nine but a half size up does indeed feel like a half size up a nine and a half measures at about 11 and a half inches for comparison my nine and a half Blazers measure in at 11 and a half inches from Heel To Toe that's like the entire thing not just what your foot fits in so just you know take that with a green song you know you know what I mean you feel me on that my size 9 Club c85s measure in at 11 and a half inches from Heel To Toe as well my hope is that you have one of those pairs of shoes and that will kind of give you a reference point on what to go off of but the Adidas website also has a handy size guide tool that I recommend you use so I would recommend going to true to size now I already know there's someone yelling at their screen saying don't go true to size if that's you comment why shouldn't someone go through the size and no these will not add any height to you sorry short Kings there isn't much of a break-in period with these and that's mainly because there isn't much of a soul these aren't something like Jordan 4's or Air Force Ones where it takes like a month before they even start to really feel like they break in I'd honestly say give it about a week and you should be good to go at least that's what the case was for me especially if you get one like this the all suede version compared to the regular leather there's a fairly good colorway selection with these but obviously the OG white with black stripes colorway seems to be the most popular right now and it's continuously sold out but luckily they are continuously restocking them if you want something like this mint green then the gazelles have way more colorways and they cost about the same these will set you back a cool 100 but honestly a lot of the colorways go on sale pretty often maybe not right now but like these I got them for 60 bucks on sale just like any other shoe just keep your eyes peeled and check back on the website regularly now one of the biggest indicators that these are growing in popularity is that the resale markets are actually starting to go over retail pricing even though this is a general release and you can get them on the website which means the demand is high it's not much over but it's about 105 to 108 dollars before tax and everything it's not much but it's still something so if you can't get them straight from retail Focus there it is surprisingly these are comfortable uh if if you look at it you're like Comfort wear but the best way I can put it is more comfortable than the kill shots more comfortable than the Blazers but less comfortable than the club c85s so somewhere in there you know you really won't have any problems walking around in these all day I've only had them for about a month now but I've done it like I don't know four or five times a bunch like you're actually walking around throughout the day too it's one area that I really haven't had any problems in not that I've had many problems with this shoe at all from what I've seen the shoe comes in either in all suede like this one with the leather stripes or basic finished leather variant which is essentially the basic leather that you know but if you want to shoot that's easy to clean definitely don't go with the suede go with the regular finish leather it'll save you a lot of time now normally I would tell you who these shoes are for but it'd probably be easier to tell you just who these shoes aren't for and even then I'm still having trouble with that the easiest way I can explain these is if they don't speak to you or you're not like dang I kind of want to try those from the get-go then don't even bother but I'm really having trouble on trying to come up with reasons why you shouldn't get these shoes the price is pretty good and that's really because it's such a versatile shoe you can style it preppy or you can go with street wear or somewhere in between that is I mean it's such a wide variety on how you can style this shoe overall it's a really great shoe and I think that's where it shines it's in its versatility on how you can style it and what it works with now I will say that it did take a little bit of trial and error to figure out what these shoes work with in my closet but once I did it is starting to feel like they go with everything after that it was just like oh I'm just put this on like yup that works if you first looked at these and you're like ah then I'll probably just stay away from them because I doubt that you would warm up to them afterwards unlike some shoes you know a lot of shoes you you're like hey yeah give them a shot and you actually end up liking them these I don't know if it'll quite go that way so I guess if you're trying to still find your own personal style or if you're really in this experimentation area these are a great direction to go all right I'll see you in the next,2025-06-19 08:41:02.694791 UTC
NmhFSdvYKB0,New Balance 990,these sneakers are 185 USD and are basically built to be slept on unless you're a true New Balance Enthusiast here are the three cons of the highest quality boring shoes you can buy number one for 185 USD or 260 Canadian these are the most expensive unmemberable sneakers I know of number two typically New Balances I go true to size but due to the large toe box I found myself needing to go half size down instead of true to size this is especially an issue if you decide to go buy online instead of trying it in store number three the comfort is nothing to write home about although it is not uncomfortable it cannot compare to the cushion Technologies of modern day sneakers due to the reminiscence of vintage performance technology go check out my other video on the three pros of this sneaker otherwise go to my YouTube channel for my full review,2025-06-23 14:42:47.299634 UTC
bWPtzJdACTU,Nike Cortez,these uh released the specific Cortez silhouette back in 1972 uh this actual color combination didn't actually officially release until 2018 uh and then in 2019 we actually saw more of a basic Forest Gump that was released and the most recent I guess or a couple most recent color combinations that kind of relate to this color blocking would be the clot which was kind of a sneaker within a sneaker but it was still the Cortez,2025-06-23 11:22:07.901761 UTC

6smKK9XP7iQ,Yeezy 350 v2,they've finally released a colorway that I actually want it's been a long time coming but I'm glad it's here what's up everybody I'm Seth Fowler and today I'm reviewing the brand new adidas Yeezy boost 350 v2 in the black colorway not only if I've been waiting a long time for this colorway I've also been waiting a long time for this exact shoe I actually tried to order early off goats so that I could have it for an early review and about two weeks after I ordered it the seller cancelled which I didn't think was the thing that you could do well at least two weeks later so about two weeks before release I figured if I bought a pair in stock X right then and there I could probably have a pair just before release so I'd still get an early review I do hate to admit but I paid like two hundred and fifty dollars over what the going resale rate is right now to get the shoe early and obviously this shoe just came in today so totally worth the money so thank you Celeron goat and seller on stock X you guys suck but finally now I have the shoe in hand and yes I'm a couple days late but at least to have it the 350 v2 in the all black colorway was one of those colorways that we always thought was gonna happen and just never seemed to happen the easy boost 350 V ones had the very popular pirate black colorway which I think out of all the 350s that have dropped is still my favorite colorway I guess we all just assumed that a similar colorway in an all-black look would eventually come out little did we know it would take two years I know I've been hating uneasy releases recently and that has a lot to do with the amount of pairs that are actually coming out but the main reason I'm not a huge fan of all these releases is because most of the colorways that we get usually kind of suck so when a colorway like this drops one that we've been waiting for for years even though it's simple I still think it's a great easy release so without further ado let's jump right into it starting off in the shoe you've got a full primeknit upper that comes in the same prime knit pattern as the statics except rather than white and gray it comes in a very dark grey and black based on pictures I had seen online of this sneaker I didn't expect it to be this gray I really do thank you is gonna be a mostly black shoe and singing in person I'm not mad at that I just kind of wish it was a little bit darker I guess the reason they went for sort of a black and gray patterned upper is because it's very reminiscent of the pirate black colorway of the V once and there's some other things on the shoe which I'll mention a little bit later that also reminds you of that shoe if you couldn't already tell this is the non reflective version of the shoe two versions of the sneaker did drop a reflective version which had 3m woven in throughout the primeknit and this more general release version which was still pretty difficult to get that didn't have any 3m in the upper and just had 3m in the laces I would have been fine with either colorway at retail but I can tell you right now for resale I would not have spent an extra $600 just to have some 3m thrown in the upper I just don't think it's worth it just like the statics you've got a plastic mesh stripe running down the lateral side but unlike the statics it's not translucent which means you can't actually see through it the stripe just comes in almost a matte black and is actually darker than most of the primeknit on the upper moving up on the shoe you've got your 350 v2 rope laces weaving through the primeknit upper and as mentioned before these real places actually do have 3m accents woven in so even though this isn't technically the reflective colorway you do still get some nice 3m shine on the laces which in my opinion is more than enough moving inside the sneaker you've got your black or dark grey sock liner that's padded around the ankle area and also has the 3m stripes on the heel the insole of the shoe comes in black with the adidas and Yeezy branding printed in white the 350 v2 in the black colorway fits just like every other 350 b2 for a lot of people that means that they should go up a size for me I go true to size and take out the insole but that's only my own personal preference adidas themselves on their website recommends to go up half a size so if you're not planning to take out the insole that's definitely what I recommend doing but if you have the chance to try on the shoe first before you buy it and make sure to do that to make sure you're grabbing the right size for you then moving back on the sneaker you find more of that gray and darker gray primeknit that really creates sort of a hypnotic pattern at least on the medial side then moving around to the heel of the shoe you've got your pull tab in black then running through the center of the pull tab you've got this red dashed line which is very reminiscent of the original pirate blacks moving down on the sneaker you've got your semi translucent black rims rubber midsole and of course encased within that rubber you've got your full-length boost midsole and if you're somehow not familiar with the three-fifty b-2s outsole at this point it comes in rubber just like the midsole and has cut throughs to the boost the easy boost 350 v2 in the black colorway is by far my favorite 350 v2 in a very long time even though it's a simple colorway it's one that we've been wanting for so long and I'm glad that Yeezy and Adidas finally gave it to us and if you don't believe me that this is a colorway that people really wanted look at the resale prices even right now they're kind of crazy but I would love to know your thoughts on the 350 v2 in the black colorway and whether you grab a pair for yourself or maybe if you grab the reflective pairs - make sure to leave those comments in the comment section down below and as always thank you so much for watching and I'll see you all in the next one,2025-06-23 14:51:45.497412 UTC

again you get 10 bucks towards your first purchase but now that you know how you can win this pair for yourself let's talk about the actual release for this shoe and how it went down so it's old news at this point but Yeezy and Adidas split up at the end of last year I believe it was October 2022 and at that point no one really knew if Kanye West and Adidas were ever going to release any more sneakers the problem for Adidas was that there was about a billion dollars with a product that had already been produced used that they couldn't release because their contract with Yeezy had been broken so over the last couple months Adidas was trying to figure out what to do with all of the product they produced they could destroy it which would be just a huge waste of product and honestly money or they could try and sell it but the problem with that was that they'd have to work with Kanye again which they weren't really trying to do so they had to find a middle ground and what they decided to do was to sell all of the remaining product on Yeezy day which was yesterday May 31st and donate a portion of the profits to some Charities and from what I can tell after yesterday's sale I believe all of the produced easy product should be gone I don't know if there's ever going to be another Yeezy Adidas release ever again I mean it's possible that there are some other colorways that they didn't show us yet that they might drop randomly in the next couple months I kind of doubt it I think that everything that they had lined up just got released but if you guys know anything else let me know in the comment section down below but during that release we got this shoe the carbon Beluga 350 V2 a shoe that's been leaked for the last year and a half it was supposed to drop at the end of last year but of course because of everything going on with Kanye and Adidas it was not able to be dropped and instead they dropped it yesterday for the standard retail price of two hundred and thirty dollars now if you missed out on the easy day sale on the Adidas confirmed app and you want to grab a pair of these for yourself I've made sure to leave affiliate links to this shoe in the top of the description below of course it will be resale links because the shoe is no longer available and what's interesting about this release is that because they were trying to completely clear out of their stock Adidas said this shoe was Final sale so if you bought a pair and it didn't fit you're gonna have to resell it but hey the good thing about this release is that this is really just another standard pair of Yeezy boost 350 V2s the only real difference between this shoe and any of the previous releases is the colorway So in theory if you've bought 350 V2s before you should be relatively comfortable with the sizing of this sneaker you should know what size to go with and uh we'll get more into that later on in the video Even though there have been some inconsistencies with 350 V2 sizing I don't know why it took five or six actually at this point Adidas has been releasing 350 V2s for seven years you'd think the sizing should be consistent by now and I think now it kind of is but over the last seven years it's been pretty different I don't know but again if you've bought 350 V2s before you generally know the sizing you generally know what you should do and again we'll talk about that a little bit later on in the video but before we dive into that let's first talk about the box that this shoe came in so as you probably could have guessed the box is pretty much standard fare for a DJ's easy boost 350 V2s you've got your natural cardboard drawer box with 350 on the top boost on the size and then I guess the most interesting part of the box is the size tag now I grabbed my pair from goat uh I spent a lot of money on it because I did next day instant ship and also something interesting about this shoe which I actually heard about in Elliot Page's review of the shoe but my box came with dryer sheets inside I didn't actually notice it when I was unboxing the shoe but then when I started to look at the shoe more in depth when I was working on this review I realized that there was dryer sheets inside the shoe and in the box and I believe that has to do with the problem Elliot page was talking about that the Paris that came from goat smelled like which I would assume that's not the case for the pairs that are coming from Adidas but who knows I mean they were sitting around for almost a year at this point so it's possible someone in the warehouse was getting a little crazy I don't know I don't know if that's goat's fault or Adidas's fault I didn't buy a pair from Adidas so I won't have any frame of reference but a very interesting problem to have and it looks like either they watched Elliott Pages review and threw dryer sheets in the Box to try and solve that problem or maybe uh there were already dryer sheets in the Box I don't know either way it didn't smell like what I said it smelled like when I actually got the shoe in it smelled like dryer sheets and now I know why but all that aside I grabbed a size nine which is my true size and the official colorway of this shoe is Carvel sticker Soul red carbon something gray solar red I would assume it's the uh the way to read that I don't know it doesn't really matter but either way pretty standard box let's get back into the sneakers themselves it's weird I got so sick of reviewing 350 V2s over the last seven years and now that I haven't done one in like six months to a year it's kind of nice to review this shoe again I haven't worn my 350s in a minute but uh it's nice to check out a new pair it's slightly different so right off the bat this carbon Beluga pair will look very familiar because it's very similar to The Standard Beluga 350 V2s the only real difference is the difference in tone on the upper of the sneaker and also the tone of the midsole of the shoe when compared to the original Beluga 350 V2 or at least the reflective version of the luga 350 V2 you'll notice that the design is almost identical except of course for the darker stripes on the side of the shoe and the darker midsole and to be honest with you I actually don't know which colorway I like better I think I'm leaning more towards the Beluga colorway because I'm more used to this colorway but this newer carbon blue colorway is actually not bad it reminds me a little bit of like some high visibility work gear but I guess so did this pair as well but there's something about that sort of Gray greenish brown gray that they use in the stripes of this shoe that just look more I don't know outdoorsy more like constructiony I'm not sure but I'd love to know your thoughts on the differences between these two shoes and which pair you'd prefer to have in your collection so let me know your thoughts in the comment section down below but getting into the materials and make up this pair of carbon Beluga 350 V2s the entire upper of the shoe is covered in your standard Yeezy boost 350 V2 Prime knit in fact this is the original primeknit pattern used on the 350 V2 over the last seven years we've had a lot of different iterations of 350 V2 Prime patterns we've had semi-translucent stripes on the side we've had completely smooth mid-foot panels a lot of different versions of the shoe but this is the original this is the one that everyone probably remembers and it's actually the stiffest version of the primeknit mainly because on this knit pattern the toe of the sneaker has the thickest or the largest amount of primer that sort of overlaid over top of each other so it's a little bit less stretchy than some of the newer pairs but really it's not that noticeable running up the center of the shoe you've got this stitching detail which actually carries all the way around to the heel of the shoe it kind of makes the entire shoe look cobbled together which I like I've said that in every 350 V2 review that has this stitching detail and I actually prefer when 350 V2s have the stitching detail versus when they don't because it just makes the shoe look more like a Yeezy boost like more pairs have this than don't and it's a detail that I really love about the 350 V2s I know some people don't but I think it's a nice touch moving down the lateral side of the sneaker you've got that iconic easy boost 350 V2 double stripe the bottom stripe is a sort of dark greenish gray color that we've seen on the rest of the sneaker and the top stripe of course is that bright orange Beluga color you've got Supply 350 or sply 350 embroidered into the orange stripe and of course the iron stripe sort of digitally Fades out or pixelates out into the upper of the shoe which I really love on both the front and the back of the sneaker and then moving to the medial side or the inside of the sneaker you get this really clear look at the Beluga wavy pattern which I absolutely love it's my favorite part of the shoe now obviously on this colorway it's a lot darker than on the standard belugas and you can actually see the orange speckling a lot clearer on this pair I'm not sure exactly why that is maybe they just made it clearer or made it more apparent on this colorway or maybe because you've got more contrast because the darker colors you can see it more and I really love the way that this medial side looks I think even more so than the medial side on the original Beluga if I could have like the outside of this shoe and the inside of this that would look awful never mind that was an awful idea now unlike the recent Beluga 350 V2 reflective release the upper of this shoe is not reflective whatsoever it's only reflective on the laces and speaking of the laces this shoe comes with your standard or I guess more close to the original 350 V2 laces they're very thick they're pretty stiff their rope laces obviously and as you can see they have a lot of reflective hits sort of woven into the entirety of the lace as you probably know 350 V2 laces don't really do much they don't really tighten the shoe around your foot they're kind of just there mainly for Aesthetics I believe I don't think they really bring the upper of the shoe together they might a little bit like if you're a size eight and a half and you grabbed a size nine they might help with the fit a little bit but this shoe is really designed more to be a sock shoe or like a slip-on style shoe I don't think I've retied the laces on my 350s in years and I just don't I just don't really see the purpose of them but they do make the shoe look better overall I think without the laces the shoe is kind of bland but with the laces it does help to sort of finish off the visual look of the sneaker personally I prefer the sort of infinity laces on the 350 V2s because it's a cleaner look you don't have these like long laces hanging off the shoe whenever you tie the shoe there are people who prefer these laces to those laces not really that big of a deal just another iteration of the 350 V2s moving towards the ankle area of the sneaker you've got this sort of dark gray greenish piping area surrounding the top of the ankle towards the heel of the shoe you've got some more of that dark gray green color on the sock liner of the shoe and of course you've got your Adidas 3 stripes on the actual heel of the sneaker they're reflective as most pairs are and then moving inside the shoe you've got that same color on the insole of the sneaker with Adidas logos and Yeezy logos printed on the heel in a slightly lighter greenish gray color so now let's get into sizing and fit and like I mentioned earlier this carbon Beluga colorway fits just like the standard Beluga colorway for me I like to go true to size Adidas actually recommends going up a half size but I prefer the more snug fit of true to size but like I said if you bought 350 V2s before you generally know what you're getting with this shoe and I would recommend just grabbing the standard size that you usually grab do what works best for you unfortunately if you grab the wrong size from Adidas you can't return it you're gonna have to resell it or exchange it or something like that so something to keep in mind but ask around I'm sure your friend has a pair you can try their pair on that's probably the best way to go also I don't know if you noticed the perfectly matching upcoming Apothecary Phyllis streets department stock collection that I was rocking in the alpha portions of this video it's fire it drops this upcoming Friday June 9th not only that we've also got a shirt which also matches the shoe incredibly well and on the back of the shirt also says Phillis streets department super cool love this collection but yeah again if you guys want to grab any of the socks or the shirts they drop officially on June 9th at apothecare.com 11AM Eastern Time following the strike back on the lateral side of the sneaker as I mentioned before towards the heel of the shoe the stripe kind of pixelates into nothingness which I think is a really nice touch of course you've got that stitching detail running up the center of the heel and then like with most other Yeezy boost 350 V2s or most of the original ones and now some of the more recent ones you've got that little butt detail right there which is kind of funny that's the way that people used to legit check Yeezys I don't know if that's still a good way to legit check Yeezys but it's an interesting little hit kind of a weird little lump on the back of the shoe I guess that's just the way that the shoe came together when it was stitched together I'm not sure but that's what Adidas Yeezys do moving down on the sneaker you get to your standard 350 V2 midsole this time around it comes in sort of a dark Smokey gray versus the light gray that the original blue just come in of course you've got a full length boost midsole underneath this rubber the outsole rubber of the shoe wraps up onto the heel of the sneaker but the good thing about that is is that unlike a lot of the other 350 V2s the outsole rubber color is very similar to the midsole rubber color so there isn't too much of a weird splotch on the back of the shoe like you do have in some other colorways but all around pretty standard easy boost 350 V2 obviously it's a new colorway one that I think some people might like more than other 350 V2s because they like the Beluga hit but they like the darker look it really depends on what you like personally in terms of colorways I mean the shoe itself is relatively unchanged from any of the recent easy boost 350 V2s the good news for you is if you missed out on a pair of these on Yeezy day which honestly was kind of hard to do because these were sitting for a long time which is weird to see for pairs of 350 V2s you should be able to grab a pair of these for retail sale or maybe like ten dollars over on places like goat and stockx and whatnot of course so if you guys want to grab these shoes grab them resale you should be good to go again if you guys want to grab these sheets for free make sure to check out my whatnot live stream Link in the top of the description below a good easy boost 350 V2 release it's not the best I'm kind of bummed that this is the last 350 V2 because it's not the most exciting pair in the world but I guess in a way it is kind of poetic because you had the Beluga start off the 350 V2s and you have a different version of the belugas finishing off the 350 V2s so a very very long and storied lifespan for a pair of sneakers that change the sneaker industry and I'm sad to see it come to an end now it's possible that this isn't the last pair to release but I'm thinking that it is and uh I'm sad to see him go although personally I did kind of stop wearing them a couple years ago just because I had so many other sneakers in my collection that were newer that I wanted to wear so not a huge loss for me personally but it is kind of sad to see such an iconic silhouette finally come to a close but hey at this point in the video I would love to know your thoughts on the carbon Beluga 350 V2 possibly the last 350 V2 to ever release so make sure let me know those thoughts in the comments section down below but as always thank you so much for watching make sure to subscribe if you haven't yet and I'll see you all in the next one,2025-06-23 14:51:46.282162 UTC
4j8-wk7IcS4,on cloudmonster 2,this is an on cloud monster 2 a robustly cushioned nylon plated Beast of a sneaker it's got crazy bounce impressive durability and large enough Cloud Tech pods to support a small village but is all that enough to counterbalance its Hulk weight so here's the deal this is the biggest running shoe that an has ever made and when they released it in Fe uary I wasn't quite sure how to categorize It 2 years ago I wrote about how running shoes were now segmented off into three categories there were the regular trainers think your new balance 860s shoes that you can run in day in day out then there were the Super Shoes the super expensive super fast super light shoes that you would use on race day and then the super trainers which were kind of a hybrid of the two they had some carbon and foam could go fast but also didn't quite have the speed of a super shoe the cloud monster 2 flipped my thesis on its head because it didn't seem to fit in any of the categories and I don't really know what it is here's what I mean with its nylon plate its huge Rock forward profile and then its two layers of energy returning foam the cloud monster 2 has way more pop than a regular training shoe but at the same time it's very heavy so heavy that it can't explode off the ground like a regular Super Shoe or even a super trainer I started thinking what kind of monster is this for Helen obiri or like Shrek my Palms just got sweaty and an's descriptions didn't really help we like to describe the cloud monster as our OG weirdo what and this time we did it again did what again cushioning baby one word Max okay but how does it compare to the max we'll just send you a pair so confused out of my skull I took them for a wear test so these are actually the most cushioned ones I've ever run in all the other ones I've tried bounce off the ground like a basketball but don't have that much support I find it's kind of the opposite of Hoka but this one has a bit of both it is a bit heavy though it's like encouraging a long loping stride because it's heavy but also it rocks you forward kind of makes you run like a monster so two pros and one Con in immediately emerged the pro that they're versatile I wore them for easy runs steady States and even a quick Tempo and they held their own they had enough bounce and cushioning to counterbalance their weight at least to an extent the other Pro is their durability now I haven't completely seen this out yet because I've only run a couple hundred km on these shoes but the original cloud monsters were good for roughly 800 km and these ones with more cushioning I'm guessing will F even better the con is that they're big some would say too big they're almost a full ounce heavier than the original cloud Monsters And while they're true to length I found that my foot got lost in their height and also their width these could cause you problems if you happen to have skinny feet let's take a closer look at how they're made that extra support I was talking about comes from the Helen foam that on uses in the shoe which is a softer material than what is in the original cloud monster look out princess here comes the new me they wedged a full layer of that foam between the foot and the actual nylon plate or speedboard in onpe for extra plushness and then another one Underneath It All That cushioning prevents you from feeling super sore the day after a big run my legs hurt the cloud monster 2os also have the biggest cloud Tech pods ever released so here I'm talking about those little energy returning underfoot holes that all on shoes have so you get more bounce in cushioning from there too and then the whole shoe has this built-in Rock forward mechanism which encourages a fast ride despite the sho's weight so alt together this shoe is actually quite different from its predecessor the original cloud monster it is heavier but offers better propulsion better energy return more cushioning scientifically the comparison looks something like this okay time for the sexy scale I've seen a lot of these on the running trail but not many outside of it I still don't think on has managed to permeate the mainstream with these massive Cloud Tech pods that being said big shoes are in Vogue right now they have been for a couple years and I do think that they're so big that they're almost unique and are kind of a statement so I'll give them a 7.5 but more importantly should you buy the oncloud monster 2 when it comes to monsters looks can sometimes be deceiving this is what we're dealing with here the cloud monster 2 is a sneaky super trainer disguised as a what was it OG weirdo right they're too heavy for racing but they work super well for long runs steady Stater Tempo workouts and even easy runs they somewhat remind me of the Nike Invincible run three so the super foam packed shoe with tons of support a long lifespan and a few hidden gears in fact if this were a little bit lighter and a bit more snug I would call it one of my favorite training shoes I don't hate you because you're fat so is this worth the buy if you can handle the weight you might come to like it as a daily trainer I've actually come to quite enjoy it it's certainly not made for Hellen ober's races but it's also not made for Shrek either it might actually work perfectly for a monster in the middle like you or me

aKIHwbBdmPo,New Balance 2002R,this is everything you need to know about the new balance 2002 r let's go what is good everyone this is john from the soul supplier here and today i have a silhouette that has been making ripples in the waves here in the uk for a minute this is the new balance 2002 r i'll be covering everything you need to know about the 2002 r and hopefully convince you to buy a pair yourself i used to be a new balance skeptic because i'm more of a drawing guy but to be honest i folded because of one of the pairs we have here today i know a few people may have strong dad vibes when it comes to new balance shoes but hear me out for the next couple minutes for a brief history lesson the first iteration of the 2002's didn't actually pop off too well because it had a really spendy retail and it almost ended up in the backlog of new balance to never be seen again but with the rebranded 2002 rs which first distributed back in 2020 we have seen a resurgence for the silhouette it's been a major hit in the sneaker community and me as a newly converted new balance fan i'd say that it is here to stay for the foreseeable future for your reference at home the pairs i have in front of me from left to right are the bonelight aluminium night watch green garnet red navy white and the phantom with that out of the way let's get into the 2002 r and why it's worthy of being your next sneaker pickup every gr pair of 2002 rs come in the standard gray new balance box and when it comes to the shoes themselves we have a great palette of colors right in front of us what's been great to see with the 2002 rs is it never really feels like they mess up the color blocking too much that isn't to say that i would wear everything that we've seen online but when it comes to the pairs that we have right in front of me every single colorway just slaps so one of the first impressions that i have of this pair is the fact that it feels incredibly light if you're looking for a shoe that you want to rock all day this is something that you'll be able to wear for a long time materials wise every pair we have here today comes in a variety of materials but the upper mainly consists of a breathable mesh and a dusty suede you might find that the materials may vary depending on what colorway you have mainly because the navy pair has a thicker suede and the light bone pair feels like it has more of a lighter mesh the quality of the upper in general feels pretty good to me i'm the kind of person that prefers level uppers more mainly just because they're easier to maintain and clean but i'm going to make an exception for these colourways because they just look way too thick looking at the mesh parts of this upper you can really tell that this is going to be a breathable pair on foot right now it's 30 degrees in london and no one wants stinky feet in this heat there are subtle details that i enjoy about the 2002 rs one of which is actually their logos because three of them have this felt nb logo and the other two have this metallic badge that says new balance running and i think that same texture is actually on the back tabs of the shoes as well you'll also find reflective detailing all across the shoe but the main one to point out is it's n logo and some of them may come stitched like this pair here or some of them may come embroidered like here you can see that each pair has flat weave laces and they won't come with spare laces either a fun fact on the sole unit of the shoe it actually gets derived from the new balance 860 v2 with gel cushioning from the heel to the midfoot and they call it energy with the absorb technology also being part of the midsole the insole also provides further comfort through a durapontex material mainly because it provides support for the heel and the arch everyone that owns a pair in this office will always mention how comfortable this pair is and i can give that co-sign as well this is a certified comfortable pair the general consensus on sizing on 2002 rs is they usually fit a half size small so if you're a uk nine like me you should be getting a uk 9.5 we have a size guide article made by one of our content writers raf so if you want to hear what the team has to say about the sizing make sure to click the i button so you can check the article out now no matter how you style this pair whether that's athleisure classy or workwear i feel like it's such a versatile pair that forgives any kind of style even if you're going for the dad look as of june 2022 and depending on what retailer you purchase from general release 2002 rs range from 99 pound to 120 pound and some collabs of special edition pairs can creep up another 10 or 20 quid collaborations were arguably the biggest contributor to the shoe success when it came back to the limelight in 2020 some of the notable collaborations include the sleigh member repairs the bait colorways the basements and we have to shout out the protection pack even if it wasn't a collab because that really shifted a lot of opinions with all things considered i really feel like it's a great price point for the shoe mainly just because other brands are going to be charging you a lot more for a lot less the quality of these materials are just well deserving of that price but if you want to make sure that you're getting your pairs for retail make sure you download the sole supplier app where you can set release or restock reminders so you get any updates on the 2002 rs or any crepes for that matter so you never miss a drop again and that was everything you needed to know about the 2002 rs hopefully it shed some light on the silhouette i kind of feel like it doesn't get as much hype as other new balance models like the 550s which we actually covered if you go on the i button over here but this model right here is well deserving to be part of the conversation of the best silhouette this year you can let us know what you think of the 2002 rs and which colorway you feel is best just let us know in the comments below i've been drawn from the soul supplier thank you so much for watching guys make sure to check out our other pieces of content as well as asking what pair we should cover next we've got unboxings in the podcast so you can always hear what the team's thoughts are there's plenty to see and enjoy we'll see you again soon you,2025-06-23 14:45:43.487791 UTC
NveiRvhnxlE,Air Jordan 1,this is how you legit check Jordan Ones on a lot of the pairs this tissue will go past the Swiss logo and end like that when you push down on the toe you want to make sure it pops back up every single time you want to make sure the stitching looks pristine around the whole shoe next you want to make sure that the r and the D touch,2025-06-19 08:40:11.652670 UTC
jqSLxWHhI_Y,Adidas Samba,this is one of the most popular Adidas shoes of all time second only to the Stan Smiths and with celebrities like ASAP Rocky Kendall Jenner and Haley Bieber wearing them all throughout 2022 their popularity has exploded to the point where throughout early 2023 there were shortages and you couldn't find these so we're going to cut these things in half run to our test to finally figure out why they've been around for 74 years how they've sold 35 million pairs why a football sneaker is suddenly one of the most popular sneakers and is this shoe still built to the same standard equality that built the samba name that's lasted 74 years when we were preparing this video I had no idea that this shoe had been around 74 years and the history is actually pretty interesting because it all starts in 1924 when Adolf and Rudolph dossler registered the name this because I'm not gonna just I'm not gonna butcher it or in English the dossler brothers Shoe Factory in Bavaria Germany then in 1928 Runner Linda Reiki won Gold in Amsterdam wearing a pair of dasler shoes 1933 unfortunate the dossler brothers were part of the thing that was going on in that country don't want to get demonetized by YouTube by talking about history but under this new government their business thrived and was able to grow rapidly and then in 1936 the infamous Berlin Olympic Games many of the German athletes were wearing the dosser Brothers Shoes along with American track star Jesse Owens who won Gold and wore the dosser track shoes during the medal ceremony which catapulted it out of the smaller Market of Germany and really brought it into the mainstream worldwide then just a couple years later World War II starts and the brothers shoe factories were converted into munition factories for the German military and Rudolph was drafted to fight but when AWOL as he thought his brother Adolf was trying to steal the company away from him and then in April of 1945 American troops were poised to destroy one of their big factories but they were convinced not to because of how big of fans they were of Jesse Owens and the shoes he wore and they didn't want to destroy they wanted to take some shoes back home with them and then in 1949 the dossler brothers relationship suffered even more to a point where there's a permanent Rift and Adolf okay Addie dossler started Adidas ADI Adidas Adidas and then Rudolph dossler started a rival company Puma which doesn't have any phonetic similarities and then in 1949 Adidas decides to make a new football shoe which was originally designed to help footballers train on icy and hard grounds and that is the predecessor to the samba which didn't wasn't called the samba because during the 1950 FIFA World Cup in Brazil Adidas tried to gain popularity in South America by giving that newly invented football shoe it's now a popularized name the samba then over the next several decades the samba became a staple product for Adidas that continued to be sold year after year to anybody from footballers to Skaters to athletes streetwear casual wear and just about anything you can think of mostly due to the versatility and the alleged quality per dollar spent and then fast forward to 2023 like I mentioned in the beginning of this video this shoe is completely exploded and popular just look at this graph on Google Trends it's crazy how popular it's become and I think the vast majority of people had no idea this shoe has been around for 74 years so what does this shoe well if the brand is Adidas the style is a Samba OG it weighs they retail for a hundred dollars they are made in Vietnam and the way the Adidas positions this shoe is born in the pitch the samba is a Timeless icon of street style the silhouette stays true to the Legacy and the tasteful low profile soft leather upper suede overlay gum sole making it a staple in anyone's closet on and off the pitch but anytime I hear a shoe that has this long of a history and it's this popular because of the quality and why people love it so much and it's been 74 years I get worried that the quality has dropped to increase the margins to get this popular shoe that built its name because of its quality they use that to sell a subpar shoe to the people who think it's something that's not which we've seen maybe 30 times with some of these old school sneakers so let's start looking at the details of the shoes starting with the upper first because we've seen a lot of these hundred dollar ish range shoes that look like they're made of full leather but as soon as you put the lighter to them and start looking at the fine details there's usually like one or two panels that's real leather and the rest is just terrible fake leather so we put the lighter to each of the panels and the toe bumper is real the vamp panel is real the lace stays are real the tongue itself is real the quarter panels are real and the only thing that's not real leather on the outside of the shoe is the heel stay and the little black accents of the Adidas Stripes so pretty impressive for a hundred dollar shoe because it's really rare to see any shoe that's one made by one of these big corporations that has all leather all the way through the upper let alone a hundred dollar shoe but what is the quality of this leather well it's it's pretty on par with the rest of the big Brands Leathers it's 1.5 millimeters thick we looked at the cross section there's just a little bit of grain in there you can also tell with the macro lens that it has a little bit of a fake embossed print into it and the thing I don't like about this style of leather is you can see because of that heavy layer of plastic on top it automatically looks like it's all wrinkled and gross because of that heavy plastic coating and we also ran the puncture test on it and it performed really well at 120 pounds so honestly first thing we looked at it's quite impressive with the samba having actually full leather through the majority of the shoe the only thing that's not leather is the little black accents but what about the inside of this shoe well just when I was had my hopes up this is all leather it is a super high quality all the way through put the lighter to the lining and the lining is fake leather and so is the tongue backer which is not that crazy you know with this much leather at 100 bucks it's already pretty impressive but I hate this fake leather because it's it is just plastic and so it's like having a plastic bag around your foot it doesn't breathe and it causes chafing if it's on your bare skin because it's they're just plastic and then looking deeper inside the shoe you've got a pretty typical lining for the rest of the shoe up near the vamp and if we pull this insole out it is a it's about as cheap of an insole as you get like it might as well not even be there because of how open cell the foam is it's it just bottoms out immediately then the lasting material it looks like it's a more rigid and more structured lasting material than what we use usually see with sneakers which starts to make me think this might actually still be somewhat of a performance sneaker and then if we look at the outsole this is where the shoe is the most interesting to me because it has really deep lugs and it has a really unique pattern these little saw teeth a little pivot point that allegedly these little things are suction cups and it's a pretty hard outsole too it's a 60 Shore a so pretty tough compared to majority sneakers that are usually like 40 to 50 short a but I wanted to see how well this outsole performed so we did the ball and bar drop test and the bar drop it bounced up 5.3 inches which is like pretty average maybe on the lower end and then the ball drop bounced up just under 12 inches which not amazing either so it seems like it's pretty on par with other shoes but I don't think it's made to be a responsive foam based rebound shoe and we also did the puncture test just for fun and it took 131 pounds which is pretty impressive for a sneaker especially a really simple traditionally made sneaker and so everything's looking like it's a pretty decent sneaker especially for 100 bucks all leather rubber a pretty sturdy outsole all but you never know to be cut in half so let's cut this in half see if there's anything else hiding and really judge the sneaker and see why it's been around for 74 years so you know how your wallets look like complete trash after like two to three months after buying it the reason it falls apart is the same reasons that your cheap sneakers fall apart because cheap sneakers and cheap wallets use cheap leather really thin thread lots of BS marketing and usually they're backed with fabric because of how weak that really terrible leather is versus high quality Footwear and our handmade wallets we use premium leather with the grain plenty of thickness in there we use a really thick stitching no gimmicks literally just leather and thread no fabric backers anywhere and it only gets better with time because we use such high quality leather it develops this unique patina that ages and wears in to get some beautiful highlights and low lights and depth depth of color and it shapes to fit your cards perfectly so check out our handmade wallet see the link in the description especially this one this is the spb wallet and since this is a sneaker video the reason it's called the SBB is because I designed this pattern when we cut apart the shattered backboard Jordans and made a wallet out of them and it's just been really popular ever since so thank you guys for checking out these wallets and our belts and all the other products we make and supporting this channel it means a lot to me so thank you guys foreign we got it cut in half and if you're not subscribed consider doing it it's how we pay to do this twice a week every single week pay the editors pay for everything that we do it's

assumed that all the bad stuff everything was hidden on the inside to get it down to the 100 price point but it's surprising what's on the inside because you have a true toe cap for once in sneaker history that so many sneakers pretend like they have a true toe cap but this one actually does and that makes sense it's a soccer sneaker you want that extra protection from kicking balls all day and the other thing is this outsole is really really thick it's six to seven millimeters thick all the way across which is double the thickness of Marquez brownlee's sneaker it's a couple millimeters thicker than the vast majority of sneakers and I think it is because it's a performance sneaker and the whole construction of the shoe and every little detail about it is about as simple and paired down as you can make a shoe and now to the questions that I want to answer from this video why have these been around for 74 years well I think the sneaker is a really good example of my probably everyone's Grandpa's favorite expression kiss keep it simple stupid no fluff no gimmicks just high quality materials that are thick and they do the job how they're supposed to do it why have they sold 35 million pairs well not all great Shoes sell millions and millions of pairs but shoes that are sold at a pretty decent price of 100 bucks that are built to this quality that customers can rely on because I think that's the biggest point of why I sold 35 million because I don't think you sell that many by just selling one to each individual I think there's a lot of people out there that have bought several of these in their lifetime and then turn other people on to them and have their kids buy them and I think it's the only way you can get to the number two spot of all Adidas sneakers and then why is a football sneaker suddenly one of the most popular sneakers of the year I honestly don't know because I don't think most people know how good this shoe is I think it was just a trendy thing on social media currently and the thing about where we're at now is Trends rise so fast but they also drop really fast so something get popular overnight but it can die overnight and when it does get popular it's not that slow creep that was all through the 80s and 90s and 2000s it's overnight so I think that's the vast majority of why they're so popular I don't think it has anything to do with the quality I think it's just how social media works is the shoe built to the same standard equality that built the samba name over the last 74 years well they are clearly pretty good Sneakers but I'm willing to bet that the previous versions were even better because if you didn't know these used to be made out of kangaroo leather which if you don't know kangaroo leather is arguably the strongest leather in the world at this thickness of 1.5 millimeters but unfortunately it is Adidas decided to quit making shoes out of kangaroo leather in 2012. maybe they have some good reasons but it would have been cool to actually have this made out of kangaroo and then finally is this a good sneaker is it worth the money it's definitely not the best sneaker we've ever cut in half but for an old school traditional sneaker I don't think there's a better one that we've cut apart that's in this price range of around 100 bucks and I think that most people that buy this sneaker are going to get their money's worth out of it which is really rare these days especially for these big Brands which really surprised me because when we were planning this video I thought for sure that this video is gonna be dumping all over sambas just like all the other traditional sneakers that have this Heritage and lineage where the brands have slowly nickeled and dimed and cut Corners away to increase those margins so it's just a carcass a facade of the former shoe that built the name but fortunately this is a rare instance of that not being the case because this is a pretty decent sneaker for 100 bucks so let me know what you guys think and if you've owned a pair of these and especially the kangaroo ones I'm curious what you thought of One Versus the other so put that in the comments and thank you guys for all your support and watching these videos it's really fun to do and show you guys what you're spending your hard earned money on instead of just guessing and hope that they work out so thank you guys see ya oh [Applause] foreign,2025-06-19 08:40:59.099163 UTC
Pq0J8pSrMgM,New Balance 990,this is the New Balance 990 V6 Bak laava a collaboration between New Balance and Renaissance Man rapper Chef TV host fighting Enthusiast Action Bronson and this shoe is wacky it's exactly what you'd expect to come from the mind of Action Bronson because he's made a career out of doing things 100% unapologetically his way so we're going to cut this thing in half and see if it's just another sellout collab that a celeb slap their name on or is there a method behind the madness that we can actually test and put real numbers to and analyze from a material science perspective and to try to understand if this is Method or Madness or both we need to look at his history and the choices he made that led to this shoe and it all started in 1983 on December 2nd where Aran Alani was born AKA Action Bronson AKA bronsolino AKA bamb bam aka Mr Wonderful AKA M bison himself AKA cor cordillo turbo AKA John Voit from the snake movie AKA Dr Bak laava is born in Queens New York to an Albanian immigrant father and a Jewish New York mother and he grew up in his father's Mediterranean restaurant learning from his Albanian grandmother that's where he developed this sense for the kitchen the love of the culinary arts all while having this love of rap and art and graffiti and in 2009 is really when we see the first hints of Action Bronson in his videos action in the kitchen and it's shockingly consistent and very much Action Bronson and on brand and we'll come back to that on brand concept later and in 2011 action breaks his leg in the kitchen which propels him into really starting his rap career since he had nothing but downtime and he independently released two albums in 2011 which are Dr Lector and well done and those albums are super different especially compared to the music at the time and action describes them as not having hooks or Bridges he'd rather just say some or just cough more of a comedic Focus rather than just repeating stuff and then in March of 2012 after releasing another mixtape titled Blue Chips he signs with Warner Brother records through Vice and the crazy thing about this is he turned down a deal with Sony and went with Vice because he said vice is more up my alley they do fun that means something I took a little less money but it worked out in the long run and 99% of people would have just taken the initial money and ran but action went with his gut and it paid off in a big way because going to Vice instead of Sony led to a ton of opportunities outside of just rap it helped start his TV career in 2014 with his cooking travel Adventure Show that's delicious and in 2015 his first non- mixtape debut album Mr Wonderful comes out with one of my personal favorites baby blue and that success led to two more shows traveling the stars with action Bron and Friends watching Ancient Aliens in 2016 and the Untitled Action Bronson show in 2017 and those shows are crazy they are once again unapologetically 100% Action Bronson and on brand but in 2018 action announces he's leaving Vice so that he can continue to do things exactly the way he wants which was followed by the release of his white Bronco album and action has said I can't be hell I can't be told what to do I'm trying so hard not to do an action Bronson accent when referencing the vice media I crave my own l you have to write your own narrative and you're the author of your own story and then from 2018 to 2022 action has gone independent releasing two more albums brought back that's delicious releasing on YouTube instead of cable and March 17th 2023 of this year this shoe gets released and so it's clear the action has always gone with his gut turned down money for creative freedom taking huge risks and just turned everything up to an 11 and it's paid off big and that's because it's not just on brand because it's obvious there's there is no brand it's just Action Bronson being In Action Bronson from action in the kitchen up to 2023 it's just Action Bronson and to be honest he's a complete Enigma to me I cuz I can't tell if he's just some sort of intuitive genius some calculated Mastermind or if he just happens to get lucky over and over and over so let's find out by analyzing this shoe starting with the material I know best which is leather because this leather is wild I've never seen this quality of leather on a sneaker this is a new Buck pig skin and and we've only seen this high quality of a pig skin on the World War II Japanese boot which was made like 70 years ago when they actually used to make decent quality products and the thing that makes pig skin so unique is is it's a lot tighter grain patter so it's stronger and at the thinner thicknesses it's a lot stronger than cowhide it's more breathable it's more pliable it maintains its properties when it's wet and then when it dries it doesn't become fragile and crack like cowhide does that's why a lot of work gloves every time I bought work gloves for various jobs I've had I always go with pig skin because of these properties and on top of that this is a new Buck leather which means it's significantly stronger and more durable than a regular suede on 99.9% of sneakers out there and that's because it has remnants of that structural grain pattern at the cross-section of the leather cuz they just sand it down to give that microfiber look so pretty wild to have that high quality of a leather this shoe is $220 it is made in the United States but is action's choice of leather actually better because apparently action knows his stuff about leather he's V visited tanneries that's what I'm saying I've been in the tanneries and I've seen it knows the lighter test better pass the test when they put the lighter to it and fortunately we've already cut apart the 990 V5 so we have new balance of stock pig skin leather to test against actions and so we did the lighter test first actions perform better we did the puncture test actions perform better and we compared these Leathers on the microscopic level and actions is a little bit thicker has a little bit more of the Grain and is basically better in every single way so super smart choice on the leather from action but was it all just luck well let's look at the reflective pounds because this stuff is crazy and just give me one minute to geek out over the material science so you can Flex on your friends I promise it's worth it so how does this reflective material work well 3m's reflective material uses retro reflective technology to incorporate thousands of microscopic beads or prisms into reflective material in low light when this material is illuminated by a light source such as a vehicle headlight it returns light rays back to the vehicle driver this is basically a million little teeny spider eyeballs like have you ever shown a flashlight on your lawn and seen the little Speckles the little bright lights spider eyeballs same concept here the spherical eyeballs work where they collect light and focus it at the back of the eyeball and then reflect it back visibly stronger because of the directional Focus that is caused by the nearly three-dimensional mirror that is an eyeball causing that light to bounce in focus and bounce back out and it's the exact same principle of Why cat eyeballs glow I don't know where toaster out he's here somewhere and this stuff looks crazy under the macro lens because you can see each IND idual bead and it feels like I'm on a little bit of the ancient alien show that Action Bronson has done because this actually with the colors that he's done this with it is a really like psychedelic macroscopic episode here especially the 3M reflective stuff cuz you can actually see the light hitting those beads and centering and bouncing back towards the camera it's wild and these colors are that final key to this whole story because this is either the most perfect accident or action knows exactly what what he's doing because most colorways you see in sneakers are going to be either monochromatic complimentary or rarely you see kind of a triatic colorway but with this shoe you have lime green purple orange and blue which at first glance just looks crazy and chaotic but after about 1 second your eye says hey what why do I like this what about this shoe is actually catching my eyeball it looks chaotic but it's my eyeball is enjoying it and that's because this is a tetratic color scheme so this looks like chaos but it's a beautiful chaos it's a harmonious chaos and we've been trying to pin this whole Enigma of Action Bronson and what he does this authenticity 100% his way that seems to be it it seems like the whole Action Bronson thing is chaotic Harmony which is what seems to be Chaos on the outside is Harmony on the inside but is that echoed in the shoe well we can't tell because we can't see what's on the inside so we got to cut it in half so let's do that see if it is Harmony on the inside or just chaos on the outside or both is all right we got it cut in half it smells actually smells really good so let's see what's inside there's way more baklava in here than we expected I've never seen this much baklava on a shoe it's crazy so even on the inside you can see there's little elements of Action Bronson in here because you can see this line of green going all the way through underneath of the insole and the lighting material that no one would ever see they could easily remove this material use a different material it doesn't need to be this n neon green but they left it in there which is really fun and part of the issue with that though is it's caused a little bit of a flaw in this shoe and it's only in one of the four shoes that we have of this model but that lining bunches up and creates really hard high pressure spots underneath the insole and and like I said it's not not something that I would expect to see in every single shoe but it's something that I would definitely check if I ordered a pair of these so is Action Bronson an intuitive genius is he lucky or is he a plotting Mastermind well he's clearly not just lucky cuz there is a method behind the madness but is it natural Intuition or is he a plotting Mastermind I honestly don't know I I can't tell if he's just developed a high level of intuition and taste because of everything he's done that can be broken down in a methodical color scheme analysis material science way or if he's actually using Material Science and color theory to make it seem like he's got crazy intuition it just comes natural to him I have no idea honestly we've put a lot of effort into this me and Sam dug through everything to try to figure this out try to get a full understanding of Action Bronson But ultimately this is an action Bronson shoe through and through it perfectly represents Action Bronson and the harmonious chaos that has been present in everything he's done and created starting from action in the kitchen all the way up to this shoe it's been consistent and I think we've gotten close to to solving this Enigma but this was a really fun way to look at action Bronson's career from a new angle instead of just a surface level facts the shoe allows us to have like this microcosm to analyze the history the aesthetic and and the theory of an artist which helps us pull these tiny little specific details it's very similar to the historical videos and it's been really really fun so thank you guys so much for your support and let me know what you think and a new colorway of the sneaker just dropped so check them out VI links below and and we're working on a a V5 versus V6 video to go through more of the actual materials instead of just all Action Bronson so that'll be coming out soon so thank you guys for everything and if you haven't subscribed consider subscribing cuz this video took a lot of work Sam grinded for a long time putting a lot of information together trying to figure out this Enigma of Action Bronson so thank you guys and uh I love doing this so thank you see you,2025-06-23 14:42:47.536913 UTC
MezCRtw8A1E,Yeezy 350 v2,this is the Yeezy boost 350 V2 MX dark salt and it could be the last 350 V2 to ever release so obviously Adidas is going through sort of a clearance program right now selling off all of their remaining Yeezy stock and not producing any other pairs of Yeezy sneakers and because of that we're getting hundreds of thousands of pairs of Yeezys all dropped on us in August 2023 and from what I can tell this could be the last set of adidases to ever draw and this being probably the last 350 to drop in the month of August means that this literally could be the last 350 ever but I guess we don't really know until they say that they're completely sold out of everything we can only guess now as far as pricing the MX dark salts are set at 230 dollars which yes is higher than some of the older 350 V2s unfortunately and if you want to grab a pair of these they are going to be available on the confirmed app or online at takeoutny.com which is one of my favorite places to go for grabbing any pairs of sneakers you guys should definitely check them out Link at the top of the description below but I think it's fair to say with the Adidas Yeezy MX Dark Souls Adidas and Yeezy are set to go out on a bang because this shoe is one of the wildest pairs of 350 V2s ever sure it's made up of almost entirely black and gray Ray but at the same time have you seen the pattern on the shoe it's insane I actually just dropped my review on the granite 350s and out of these two shoes I absolutely prefer this shoe I just think it's cleaner and easier to wear but this is still not a bad look and if you like this sort of MX pattern on the upper of the shoe you're probably gonna love it but speaking of this pattern let's dive right into the upper so a majority of the upper of this shoe is made up of some variation of prime knit obviously it's a different knit pattern that we've seen on other pairs of 350 V2s and of course like some of the newer models of 350 V2s you've got the semi-translucent plastic stripe running down the lateral side actually in this case it's not semi-translucent it is a mesh so you could in theory see light through it but because the meshes died completely black it's almost impossible to see anything through it like your brand new pair of Apothecary no-show sucks that was a subtle plug but we're dropping no-show socks for the first time ever this weekend if you guys want to check them out Link in the top of the description below and they sit just below the Yeezy act collar line which means that they're perfect to go with a pair of Yeezys grab a pair of these grab a pair of those perfect match not only is the side stripe a lot more difficult to see through because it's black it's also a lot more apparent on the side of the shoe because it's just behind black almost Sharpie line across the side of the sneaker and personally I don't love it because it's such a dominant detail and on top of an already pretty crazy pattern it just creates a lot of visual confusion in my own opinion obviously you could think different it doesn't matter if you think different that's fine it's your opinion but I don't really love it I kind of wish they had gone for a more subtle stripe like maybe a gray or maybe even just not had the stripe and just gone with the crazy pattern around the entire upper of the shoe I think that would have been a lot cleaner but getting into the crazy pattern that I just referenced it's made up of like three different Shades of Gray you've got a very dark gray at the base you've got sort of a medium gray in the middle and then you've got a light gray sort of rounding off the accent and as the name of the shoe would suggest this pattern is the mixed pattern the MX pattern at least that's what we assume that it means and it kind of looks like they marbled the primed pattern on the upper of the shoe which I'm not gonna lie is really interesting it's different but again I think if they had just gone with purely the priming on the top of the shoe instead of adding this black stripe it would have been a little bit more wearable like for example when you look at the medial side of the shoe I think this looks great it's super interesting it's wild but it's not too wild and I think if this had been the design on both sides of the shoe I would have preferred it but if again that's all my own personal opinion you guys don't have to listen to me but I guess you're watching this video so maybe you do care about my opinion a little bit and this MX pattern is also pretty interesting because it's the newest Prime knit pattern on a pair of 350 V2s in fact for a while there it looked like we were going to get primarily just MX primed it on all the new 350 V2s but unfortunately because of the way that things split between Adidas and Kanye it looks like this might be the last ever MX and uh we only got like I think two or three colorways because there's so much layering going on in the knit of the shoe because of the design it is a little bit stiffer than standard 350 V2s especially when you compare it to the Granite pair which is just a very simple solid color knit so uh I guess in theory it is a little bit less comfortable than the granites however you don't really feel it on foot so it's not that big of a deal even with all this crazy stitching going on in the upper of the shoe it's still very comfortable it still feels like a sock on top of your foot obviously these are not as soft as something like a pair of ultra boost but still a very comfortable upper running down the center of the shoe you've got the scene that shows where the two pieces of material came together to make this pair of sneakers however unlike older pairs of 350 V2s they actually hid the stitching detail underneath the upper of the shoe it's actually how it's supposed to be done but they flipped it inside out for all of the other pairs of 350 V2s and it seems like for these newer Pairs and I guess some of the older pairs as well they decided to go for a much simpler line or same down the middle I guess it's because the upper of the shoe is already pretty crazy that could also not be the case I don't know why they decided to do it this way on this shoe but they did and uh I I don't really care either way over top of the seam and weaving through the upper of the shoe you've got this dark gray Infinity lace which means it has no ends you don't tie it it's already kind of laced together I think this is the closest that they ever got to a slip-on pair of 350 V2s if you do want to tighten the shoe you can pull on this little like tab right here and that will tighten up the upper a little bit for you but I would just suggest grabbing the right size and you should be good to go actually speaking of sizing the MX dark salt colorway of the 350 V2s fits like most other pairs of 350 V2s now I personally like to go true to size because I like a more snug fit however Adidas actually recommends going up a half size on their website so if you've never tried a pair of 350 V2s before I would suggest going on up a half size if you already own a couple pairs of 350 V2s grab the size that you usually grab and you should be just fine around the top of the ankle opening you've got this dark gray piping and then moving inside the shoe on the sock liner of the sneaker you've got that reflective Adidas three stripes hit on the back of the heel rounding off the inside of the shoe you've got a dark gray matching insole with the Adidas and Yeezy branding printed on the heel in black and then moving around to the heel of the shoe you've got this black pull tab which actually seems like an extension of this black stripe along the side of the shoe because it's the exact same shade of black I don't know if I like the pull tabs for a while I didn't like the fact that Yeezys didn't have them and then I kind of prefer the easies that don't have them the granites don't have them and I actually think it makes the shoe look a little bit cleaner but I also like having it because it adds a bit of detail at the back of the shoe I don't know I'm undecided on the pull tabs but this one has it this one doesn't there you go moving down on the shoe you get to that classic easy boost 350 V2 midsole it comes in sort of a dark smoke or I guess dark salt gray what even is Dark Soul is there a dark I might be stupid oh there actually is a legit dark salt that's like a very similar color to this wow the name is on Point that's crazy then moving to the bottom of the sneaker you've got a similar colored rubber on the outsole and of course your cutouts through to the Boost I don't love this colorway it's not a pair of 350s I throw on on a regular basis it's not a bad shoe it's still very comfortable and I'm sure there's a lot of you out there who love this sneaker but for me it's probably a no-go that being said I do still think that this sneaker will probably sell out and while it probably won't resell it'll be a pair that's definitely popular and there's probably hundreds of thousands of pairs of these so I'm sure you guys will see these around but let me know your thoughts on the MX dark salts in the comment section down below make sure to subscribe if you haven't yet and I'll see you all in the next one,2025-06-23 14:51:45.748490 UTC
aFjSYH6fWf0,on cloudmonster 2,this is the big and bold oncloud monster 2 and it looks pretty similar to the oncloud monster one and how is this different than the also big and bold oncloud Eclipse let's lace up the oncloud monster 2 and take it for a run yo what's going on my name is kofuzi and I'm a non- elite Runner who reviews running shoes here on YouTube and today I want to talk to you guys all about the on cloud monster 2 but before I give you my thoughts on this isso I do want to go over some disclosures an sent me these shoes for the purpose over review so I didn't have to pay for these shoes however no one's paying me to make this video or to include their shoe in this video and no one's going to get a chance to preview any of my footage or my thoughts before you guys get a chance to see this video on YouTube so with that disclosure out of the way let's talk about the oncloud monster 2 and first let's go over some specs this is a 35 mm stack heite shoe with a 6 mm drop giving us 29 mm of stack heite in this shoe and that's quite a bit bigger than last year last year started at 29 in the heel maintained the same drop but only had 23 mm of stag height in the 4 foot and an is telling me that the reason for the difference in stack height is that the clouds are now bigger and now I'm not sure that the actual holes that are in this midsole that they're calling the clouds are bigger than in the shoe from last year in fact they looked pretty similar to me but something that is definitely noticeable is that there is a second color of foam here in this shoe and that is a more dense top layer of midsole foam on top of a I guess regular layer of midsole foam that comprises the the channels that make up the cloud Tech uh in this midsole and in contrast to the speedboard which is kind of like a hard piece of plastic kind of like a carbon fiber plate but also very much not like a carbon fiber plate uh that they've had in other traditional on shoes like in the oncloud monster one this year the material that the speedboard is made out of is nylon and it's a bit shorter it's not a fulllength speed board this year either so quite a bit of changes in there now protecting all this midlle is rubber that covers most of the surface of the bottom of the shoe in fact it's pretty similar to the pattern of rubber we've had last year and while we're looking at the bottom of the shoe I will point out that there's a very subtle difference that took me a long time to notice in fact there's two of them one is that there's a little bit of a protrusion right here at the side of the foot kind of like on the inside of the pat of your big toe uh that gives it a little bit more of a medial protrusion it's something that I I generally am seeing in a lot of big stack height shoes that also still want to be able to move quickly the other thing that I've noticed on the bottom of these issues is that the channel that exposes the speedboard in Cloud monster one has been filled in with midsole phone so we can no longer see uh the nylon speedboard that's in the oncloud monster 2 moving to the upper we have what to me looks almost identical to the upper that we saw last year certainly there's some color differences but in terms of fit and finish it looks almost exactly the same as the on cloud Monster version one but again a closer inspection shows that there's one additional lace Loop that's in the lacing system here and there's just a tiny bit more padding at the back of the heel cup in this shoe otherwise they're pretty much the same and very difficult for me to discern just by looking at the uppers which is on cloud monster 1 and which is on cloud monster 2 and I do want to note that of the upper materials in here it's made out of 82% recycled polyester altogether this shoe comes in at a total weight of 10.5 Oz or 300 G now that we talked about the paper specs let's go over what it was like to actually run in the shoe and I feel like this is very much a monster experience despite all the changes that we've discussed at length here already I feel like I'm getting a very similar experience compared to what I had last year in the oncloud monster 1 it's a shoe where I'm starting to feel that the clouds in on cloud shoes actually make sense I start to feel the squishiness of the clouds and overall it's a stable yet bouncy experience that I find Pleasant for easy day running but I will say because of that firmer top layer ultimately what I'm feeling in the shoe is a little bit more of like impact absorption like the foot hits the pad and you're not getting shock sent up through the foot uh but on the downside of that I'm losing a little bit of the spring back uh that I feel like I got from the oncloud monster one so those will be some of the slight differences in feel that I'm sensing between these two shoes but ultimately it's still very much an on experience so those of you who have been running in on shoes for a really long time are still going to enjoy and appreciate the oncloud monster 2 it still feels like there's a speedboard in here it still feels like there's that channel in the middle which gives you that sense that the shoe is guiding your foot strike uh sometimes I feel like that's a little bit aggressive or overly assertive uh but for those of you who have liked the way that on shoes feel in the past you're still going to get that sense of like the shoe guidance from that Center Channel that's built into these on cloud monster 2 and as tall and as squishy as all the words are that we're using to describe these shoes I feel like they're a little bit firmer than I would like for a shoe that's kind of of this size and intended to be used for everyday recovery days and some of your longer easy runs and I think that the cloud monster 2 while it does feel different than the cloud monster one feel like it's delivering a very similar experience and a lot of the sensations that I felt in Cloud monster 1 can be pretty much cut and pasted onto the cloud monster 2 the upper is beautiful and very comfortable but I feel like it's a little bit uncharacteristic from on in the sense that it's a little bit on the baggy side there's a bit too much room for my foot in this shoe I don't think that sizing down is necessarily the issue here I just think that it's a very roomy shoe I think it's intended to be that way and so it feels baggy and a bit imprecise which is not usually two adjectives that I would associate with the Swiss engineering of the on brand if you're looking for a taller stack heite shoot that isn't unstable I feel like this is going to be a really good choice my bigger taller friends I think are also going to really enjoy the level of responsiveness and the level of decompression in this foam and for anyone that's just looking for a shoe that's very comfortable to travel in I took this uh on a a trip with the family out to Arizona it's a really great travel and Casual Wear shoe as well now that we've talked about what it's like to run in the shoe let's talk about some of the pairing options and the buying guide and Alternatives and that's I think where the video is going to get the most interesting but first let's go over the pairing options and because I think that the oncloud monster 2 is going to be very popular with my bigger taller friends I've put together like a bigger taller running friend training rotation so if you're going to use the oncloud monster 2 as your daily trainer and your easy run shoe I think that uh some pairing options you need are a faster day shoe and then a carbon plated eraser so for your workouts I feel like a shoe that you guys are going to enjoy is going to be the Hyperion Max it is a DNA flash midsole shoe with no plate in it it's got an extra tall stack height that's what makes it Max and a very comfortable yet Speedy upper I feel like this is going to be a fun shoe to take for your workouts and speed sessions and for your races shoe that I think you guys are going to love is going to be the Hoka C X1 this is a tall jumbo shoe that still fits within the world Athletics rules requirements for stack heite it's got a giant sweet spot for your foot to hit the ground and it's got very pleasant peba midsole racing foam in here that's going to give you a great amount of cushion but a great amount of snappiness as well I feel like those three are going to be really fun to run in together now let's talk about the buying guide and some Alternatives the on cloud monster 2 comes in at $180 and I feel like that is a good price for an on shoe but I feel like it's a little bit High let's take a look at what the competition in the market has in store now I feel like the biggest competition that the oncloud monster 2 comes from within on itself and I've already been talking a lot about the oncloud monster one right now it doesn't seem to be on sale on shoes don't really tend to go on sale that much but it is $10 cheaper than this year's on cloud monster 2 so I I feel like if you're interested in the oncloud monster 2 save yourself 10 bucks go with the oncloud monster one it's going to be a little bit cheaper and I feel like deliver a very similar experience the other shoe that from on which is competition is the oncloud eclipse now this is another shoe that comes in at $180 but delivers a very on experience that's also very different at the same time now what on seems to have been doing these two shoes is they're kind of having parallel product lines now there are traditional on shoes that have the cloud Tech the kind of like hexagonal Cloud shapes and then there's this new kind of cloud that an has been developing called cloudtech phase that has more of like a triangular Cloud shape uh we've seen it in the oncloud surfer and in the oncloud eclipse and in this kind of separate parallel line of products from on they are kind of really doing away with the speedboard the oncloud surfer doesn't have a speedboard at all this one doesn't really have a speedboard but it has kind of like a little torsion bar at the bottom if you remember kind of the old older Ultra boost shoes that they used to have torsion bars uh that's kind of what they're using here instead of the speed board now I don't like the speed board at all and I like the extra squishiness and springiness and the extra kind of dynamic of the cloudtech phase so I'm very much drawn to what the oncloud eclips has to offer I feel like it's a lighter shoe it's a more exciting shoe and I feel like it's a shoe that I actually can run uh up to moderate Paces in it really well for long distances plus I feel like it does all the other Max cushioning things that the oncloud monster 2 does but I think the way to decide between these two shoes is to decide which kind of on shoe you like do you like the original on or do you like the new kind of on with the cloudtech phase me I'm going with the oncloud eclipse and the new cloudtech phase beyond that in order to really understand like where the rest of the market sits when it comes from a pricing perspective we've got to leave on for a minute and I'll give you even two more Alternatives that I think you guys should be looking at if you're looking at the oncloud mod monster 2 first let's take a look at the New Balance SE Elite version 2 now this has a race day foam new balance's fuel cell material and a carbon fiber plate this is a shoe that personally I used very similar to how I would use the on cloud monster 2 as a easy day shoe as a recovery day shoe or a long slow distance kind of shoe something where I could pick up the pace a little bit but kind of all the elements that are in here including the carbon fiber plate are really more for stabilizing the shoe for long periods of time time rather than for making it race day fast uh and so this is a shoe that I think Stacks up really well against the oncloud monster 2 but I do feel like it's a softer more Dynamic experience so again my set of performances leading me this way versus the oncloud monster 2 and the SC Trainer retails at 180 so price-wise I feel like On's doing a pretty good job here but depending on if you have a very large foot you might be able to find this shoe for as low as $143 but for the rest of us to the extent there there's still inventory left you're looking at the full 180 price now the other shoe that I think is going to give on a little bit more of a run for its money is from Adidas and that's the Boston 12 now this is a shoe that I don't love as a Boston but when I look at the shoe without labels on it I feel like it lines up really well with what the oncloud Monster 2 is offering the Boston 12 does have some race day foam in here but it combines it with Light Strike and some energy rods that serve to stabilize all this foam together it's a shoe that I like for easy days recovery days and some of those long slow distance runs again very much how I use the oncloud monster too so I think this Stacks up really well it's also very popular with my bigger taller friends and the Boston comes in right now at $160 retail I really feel like this shoe should be on sale but with the Boston Marathon around the corner and a new Boston Edition having been released I feel like it's going to stay at that 160 for at least a little while longer but still even at that full ret retail it's $20 cheaper than the oncloud monster 2 so those are my thoughts on the oncloud monster 2 and a bunch of its competition let me know in the comments if you have any other questions or better yet stop by the live stream that I do Monday through Friday over on the kofuzi Run Club Channel I'd love to talk to you guys over there in the chat that's all for today everybody thanks so much for making all the way to the end of this video hopefully you guys are staying safe out there on your runs and I will see

lhH1geeeSZQ,New Balance 2002R,this is the full review of the New Balance 2002r I did not expect to fall in love with it because it looks incredibly underwhelming in my honest opinion but as we all learned as kids don't judge a book by its cover in other words don't be deceived by what you see this sneaker runs my typical New Balance shud to size which is US men's 8 and A2 this is the same size as my Nike sizing the sho's MSRP is $150 USD or $180 Canadian it weighs 410 G and features an absorb midsole absorb SPS cushioning and energy outsole for shock absorption it's also made in a combo of pig skin Suede and mesh the overall Comfort is simple it's comfortable in all scenarios you can walk in them for a very long time due to its responsive gel-like Comfort but it isn't overly soft where you lose stability and gain foot fatigue it's also incredibly breathable which makes it a great summer sneaker for various weather conditions besides dry ones you might want to consider another sneaker or even a boot as there isn't much water protection though they do have a gortex version on the 2002r there are also on sale and I've heard that they aren't as comfortable as the original as it features a tougher upper which makes it less breathable and also less flexible all in all this new balance 2002r is a great sneaker for all kinds of uses is if you watch this video so far then you must like my content so hit that subscribe button if have not already and let me know in the comments below what you think this has been Billy visuals yall just got visualized and I'll see you in the next one peace,2025-06-23 14:45:41.798079 UTC
KsJGEXJtcG0,on cloudmonster 2,this is the oncloud monster 2 on running's newest addition to the Daily trainer category and it's going to cause some serious problems for other brands this year so for those who not familiar with the on cloud monster or On's running shoes as a whole the cloud monster one was On's biggest or best entry or where I think they kind of started to become a real contender in the running shoe industry with high quality shoes so the the first version was On's highest cushioned and comfiest and also probably the best shoe that they had released at the time and for me it was one that I enjoyed but also probably didn't enjoy it as much for easy running and steady running and maybe some Tempo stuff as other competitors it's still a great shoe people got on with it and people really enjoyed it but for me it still wasn't quite what I wanted which is generally a high stack shoe the shoe that feels a bit more cushioned Under Foot and this is where this is complet completely change with the oncloud monster 2 it is a drastic difference almost like a day and night difference the only thing similar for these two shoes is the name and also some obviously hole designs and some lacing systems kind of similar still changed but we're going to get into that in this video and give you my full thoughts on this shoe if you've tried this please comment down below what you think of it so other people can get a better idea from more people different running Styles different paces and that way it's the best way people can see how that shoe would suit them I don't like going on the on website and reading what's new about the shoe how much it weighs if there's been a foam change because I think it gives you some subconscious bias in there whereas if you see something's changed on the website then you're automatically going to try and pick up on those things and maybe without even knowing think that they've changed even though they might not have uh it's just your mind playing tricks in you so I try to not read anything not see any reviews until I've tried the shoe and see how it feels so that's what I've done here I still as of this recording of the video I will include it on the screen the new specs but I'm not even going to say them because I haven't checked so I just want it to be completely unbiased or have not paid us to do this review either so they just sent the shoes for a review and this is an honest review on them and they're not going to be able to see the footage before this goes live so completely honest unbiased not not any subconscious bias either so it's just my full thoughts so as mentioned I do prefer a softer more High cushioned shoe kind of what feels a bit nicer so I sometimes try to sacrifice that snappiness or ground contact feeling shoe which gcloud monster one by the way um especially in the four foot it's very Snappy and you know he kind of a bit closer to the ground and it's quite aggressive in that side of things whil it's also having a good amount of cushion but the second version is substantially more cushioned a lot softer and also has more stack in both the he in the heel and also the forefoot it noticeably bigger and I knew that without even seeing the specs and especially in the for foot the cushion is complet complet difference to the first version in the first version you kind of see the cushion and to be honest it was a bit stiffer in the foref foot than it was in the heel overall it was still a pretty stiff shoe um in terms of like an easy running shoe or a daily trainer which a lot of people do like but again I prefer the softer side of things so that's was not an issue with this shoe but it kind of didn't feel how I wanted it to feel whereas you can probably tell by how mudy it is I'll try and get that on camera I've been wearing this shoe a lot pretty much for everything easy miles daily miles and some faster stuff with some strides in there as well so pretty much done everything in the shoe and that's because it just feels unreal and it's a very fun shoe to run with first of all starting with the lacing system as you can probably see compared to the first version it is a similar structure but on the second version you've got a bit of a thinner wire what keeps the laces together rather than on this version it's a bit more of a thicker material and for me that makes more of an elasticated fit what fits fits a bit better to your foot so the lock down on this upper is perfect like the tongue is nice and thin so saving weight there but it's also comfortable and It just fits really nicely on the foot the upper as a hole is probably the most similar thing about the shoe I'm not sure if there is a change but ultimately it kind of does feel very similar it's a bit more structured in the heel so you can see as I push down there there is a bit of push but it's kind of all together and Al also when you push the back the heel cup or heel tab isn't going anywhere whereas on this shoe if you push it goes down a lot easier and it's a lot less structured it's a bit it's a bit more just random like you could push anywhere and that bit would go down and the other surrounding bits would stay where they are and also the back is a little bit more Loose as well so the new the new shoe more structured a lot more innate stability as well I'm not quite sure if this orange bit here which isn't featured on this shoe like this shoe just has one bit of foam going through it the unCloud monster 2 has a different section here which feels pretty similar I can't lie in terms of density and softness but it's separate maybe there's a reason for that because as I'm going through my stride it's almost impossible to pronate in the shoe for me so it's very innate stable even though it's not a stability shoe it definitely passes the test in terms of keeping you stable on your feet and uh just going forward rather than a lot of lateral movement which sometimes you get with high stack and softer shoes onto the mid so which everyone cares about I think the main difference between the two shoes in terms of the midsole and the outs soole is the foam density so the foam on the onclan monster 2 is much softer than on the first version and it's also higher stack as mentioned that just means a more of an accommodating ride feels a lot nicer especially at easier paces and longer distances this will save your legs a lot more than the first version and the reason why I've been choosing this shoe over any other shoe I've got or in for review is because this has been kind of feeling the best at those Paces it's not as soft as let's say a New Balance Fresh Foam more V4 or a Nike Invincible but it's a bit more lively it's a bit more fun to run in it's a bit more Poppy and it still has a lot of cushion as well I would say it's a lot more comfortable than the Nike invincible and it's more stable than the Nike invincible and it's more poppy than the Nike Invincible the only thing it doesn't quite have is as soft but to me I think a lot of people the Invincible can be too soft at times where it feels a bit dead whereas this is always a bit Lively and you know even if you're feeling rough on some easy days it's enough to kind of keep you going massive change on the out soole from the first and second version you can see through the shoe on the first version straight to the speedboard A lot of times Stones got in that and it was really annoying on the new version that isn't the case you just got foam there so more foam first of all you're not going to get any Stones getting through and getting stuck here and ultimately again like I said more foam more cushion better feeling the Appo remains pretty similar in terms of the rubber as you can see it's basically the same you've even got the same design in terms of three at the back and then six at the front you've got exactly the same there I do think maybe it's cuz it's a newer but there is more traction and also it's a bit thicker on the out Soo there seems to be a bit more rubber and also a bit more of a stick out with um the dents of all the circles so maybe that's just wear and tear this is obviously a newer shoe but it definitely feels a lot nicer under foot the only disadvantage I would say about this shoe which is disadvantage that I'm trying to reach because I don't want to just leave a video where it's just all good things and there's not any where to improve I would say that obviously as mentioned this heal counter is loose whereas this heal counter is a bit stiffer and that's great for ankle support So anyone who's got like you know dodgy ankles I think it really keeps your ankle in place but anyone who doesn't need ankle support it's probably too supported in the sense that you could have a bit more weight taken off if you didn't need it but ultimately it doesn't negatively affect you it just means that the shoe could have been lighter if this wasn't there but it's not a heavy shoe doesn't feel heavy feels heavier than the first version but that's cuz the first version's a lot less of a shoe whereas this is a lot more of a substantial shoe and like I said it feels livelier than other competitors and for me I'm not sure on the exact weights between competitors but even this even this was heavier which I'm pretty sure it's not cuz it feels pretty light it wouldn't matter because it still feels Lively so that's what you're after it doesn't really matter too much about the weight it's about how the shoe feels on the foot which to me in the minute it's the most enjoyable shoe to wear prefer it to everything else and I get to review pretty much every single shoe out there and competitors for that easy running and daily mileage stuff I would say where the first version was very tuned to that daily stuff so you can Tempo in it you could do some steady running do some easy running it felt best at probably steady Paces this feels good across the board but I think it's more tuned to that higher stack easier pace and that's why I think it excels the most where it just feels really nice as you pick up the Pacers I would say it's still better than the first version but it doesn't feel as speed ready as fast because again the drops only 6 mm on this so it's not as aggressive of a drop also you've got more in the forefoot overall so the toe off doesn't feel as aggressive so I don't think it is slower but you just don't feel as poppy or as Speedy going through your stride which I like like I don't need that in an easy run shoe it's just you probably wouldn't feel as Swift on a Tempo or some faster stuff when you're doing strides and sprints again bouncy feels great maybe maybe too high for people to want to do like mechanic working or drills in but ultimately really enjoyable shoe and for me Cloud monster 2 is at the top of the class at the minute in terms of easy or steady miles so for me it's the shoe that I'm going to be wearing for the foreseeable future for my easy and steady runs just feels great so yeah if you want to get the shoe we'll link it in the description uh we don't get any commission off that but it's just nice for you to be able to find the shoe and read the reviews for yourself so thank you for watching and goodbye,2025-06-23 14:41:07.191575 UTC
JUuaIWEq5dg,Vans Old Skool,this is the review of the band's old-school pro now so this make you move over to this channel it's been a little bit of complaints about the sound so I just said upgrade our chance to some big production things yeah so he plugged in anything now the man is old-school pros cost $17 I did buy this myself which means you getting honest reviews for me because vans ain't sponsoring nothing the old-school pro is advanced classic but they did do a little bit please for some grated performance now they did give it a durable canvas with a suede upper as well as a single wrap foxing tape now bands I don't know what that means but I'm just gonna figure out if they skate good or not that's what I'm here for I don't know the skate bands without them but I can see why a lot of people do like to see them cuz it's a very classic looking skate shoe all at the same time rightly starts getting me to get broken in like really easy now when you come to looking to shoot I would have to say this gives a 10 out of 10 because when I went to go flick a hard flip it was clean it was cohesive and I loved it I don't know cohesive makes sense in this statement but I'm just gonna be acting like Vans using all kinds of words to describe things like a fox tell animals that means today works the look of the old-school pros is a classic look back to respect now I've seen so many people growing up wearing them that I think I just automatically like I think I might just be giving in to peer pressure but don't you judge me because everybody likes something that's popular I'd have liked me on the first session of skating these they were a little stiff but every shoe you ever skate is the first time you skated halfway through the section though they're pretty much broken in but I didn't have to do anything special to get used to it's not all just rainbows waterfalls out here now fans we got a little bit issues issues with laces I don't know what the deal is with how long these laces are because you got enough place for two shoes on one shoe not really a big deal but still it's none I'm just getting these shoes for about two weeks now and I've already got a Holmes both of them as a matter of fact I got a hole the second time I started skating them so this durable canvas thing is a myth not real 10 like 10 steps turn over all the old-school pros are not my absolute favorite chute escape however I did enjoy ski and I just wish that they would last a little bit longer so the HDR curve protection isn't really that HD cushiony at all because I ended up in my own insulting and these didn't really do any I can't give you don't need to know anything all you need to know is if you like bored do you keep them not just put some more in sold in because they don't work they're not cushiony hey that's my review the band's old-school Pro so if you want to go ahead and get these shoes because they look cool do it if you want to get them cuz you're gonna skin constantly I would say prepare for them not really last that long because they blow through quick yes go ahead and subscribe to the channel if you want to see more shoe reviews comment let me know what she's gonna do next go ahead and bring that belt so you can go ahead and get notified every time cooking issue of you follow this grandfather Twitter every single thing of those things and Japan and this,2025-06-23 14:38:23.013090 UTC
AB_pYO5eKbM,Vans Old Skool,this is the van old school Pro Skate Edition and it might just solve all of my problems that I've been experiencing when wearing my classic Vans old schools so my absolute favorite pair of sneakers of all time has got to be the Vans old school but in the past 2 years I haven't really been wearing my Vans old schools that much anymore most of my errands that I run my grocery shopping going to the gym going to pick up medication or whatever from CVS all of that happens on foot with a backpack on so it's very typical of me to walk 2 miles in an evening just to run a few errands now when I was driving everywhere I used to wear these shoes all the time but now that I'm walking everywhere I'm really starting to see that there are a lot of limitations when it comes to comfort these are only good for about a mile walking maybe too if you're pushing it but if you start to wear these a couple of days in a row they really do start to take a toll on your feet and it just takes a month or two to get these fully broken in but at that point what little support and cushioning they have is totally gone and it really feels like you're just walking in glorified socks walking barefoot enter the Vans old school skate Edition which may just solve all of my issues with the classic Vans old schools now I already tried the older version of these they used to call them the Vans pro line so they would be the old school Pro the authentic pro now they rebranded them as the skate Edition my issue with the Vans old school Pro Pro or any of the pro lines is that my feet would just sweat like crazy I remember one time I was driving in my car and it was probably like late summer early fall the temperature was around 70° and just after 10 minutes of sitting down it felt like my feet were in fuzzy winter slippers that's how bad the ventilation was in them so when I got these I was super skeptical that my feet would still overheat for some reason my feet are very very sensitive to the temperatures I get hot feet in the summer and cold feet in the winter so I really have to be careful with what type of shoes I wear and this lack of ventilation in the pro model that they used to make is the reason why I just gave up on them and still went with the classic Model but I'm happy to report that after wearing these for just a few weeks and some pretty hot temperatures here in the Northeast my feet don't overheat at all now maybe they get a little bit hotter than if I was just wearing the classics but honestly the Vans classic old school doesn't breathe very well either the first day when I got these shoes I wore them around the house I have one the classic on one foot and the skate version on the other foot and I was trying to see which one is my left foot which has the skate version is my left foot sweating more than my right foot and it maybe was sweating a little bit more but it was very hard to tell the difference unless I was really zeroing in on it now there are three main reasons why I got these shoes the first reason pretty obvious I wanted better Comfort while the classic Vans are very comfortable for wearing walking for for a mile or two maybe wearing them for the gym just for an hour they still do lack a lot of that comfort and support especially if you're living inner city and doing all of your grocery shopping and errands on foot like I mentioned I was at the beginning of this video so I just wanted to have a shoe that's as cool looking as this but has a lot more Comfort meaning that I can wear them more often I don't have to worry about what I want to wear my cool Vans old schools but I'm going to be walking 5 miles today so I have to wear something like an Adidas sneak which is not as stylish I was just tired of either having to pick a shoe that looks absolutely awesome and is super stylish but hurts my feet for an all day walk or a shoe that's a lot less stylish but I can walk forever 10 mil plus reason number two I'm seriously looking to pair down the items in my wardrobe and just pair down the material items the amount of material items that I currently own now for example if I go to my mom's house out in Long Island I usually take my bike on the train and I wear something like this because this is an awesome cycling shoe with flat petals one time I went there and I actually only had these shoes I didn't have any other shoes my feet did start to hurt we were there for about four or five days so what I always had to do was take one stylish pair for cycling but I also had to take a pair like this which is my comfortable walking shoe and by the way I really enjoy this shoe as well but I always found that I could never just rely on this shoe because it hurts me and if I rely on this shoe while this shoe is cool sometimes I'm not in the mood to actually wear something like this I want to wear something more classic so what the skate version of the old school is going to do is it's going to allow me to instead of bringing two shoes when I'm traveling I can bring one shoe and that just means that maybe I can get rid of some of the old pairs of Adidas Ultra boost some of my old pairs of even my colan original Grand I have a lot of shoes just for Comfort reasons and just because I walk so often what this shoe is going to allow me to do is get rid of two or three of my comfort stylish shoes or just my comfort shoes which in the end means I'm going to have less shoes less things to look after less things to clean life will be overall simpler and the third reason is I just want to wear my Vans a lot more often particularly my Vans old schools like I mentioned the Vans old school is my favorite sneaker of all time for me it's the goat sneaker when I'm wearing my Vans old schools I never feel like my style is lacking I'm always very satisfied with wearing them now of of course if I want to wear dress shoes or dress boots or casual shoes that's a different purpose this is more of like a very stylish casual shoe and it's a nice way to spruce up an actual super casual outfit it's going to look a lot better than a pair of Adidas New Balance any type of Comfort shoe and when I'm wearing this shoe I never feel like I need to go out and get a pair of leather sneakers a pair of allwhite sneakers I never feel like I need anything else as far as the sneakers go this checks all the boxes for me so I'm super psyched on this shoe I'm psyched that my feet don't overheat in them I'm psyched that it's so comfortable the other day it was very hot here in Queens and I ended up walking 7 miles I filmed a video these shoes absolutely great so what I'm going to do what this is going to allow me to do is I can get rid of my classic bands old schools I have them in Navy and I have them in Black so I can get rid of two of these right I'm already pairing down and as my Adidas Ultra boost starts to wear away I don't have to replace them as much since I just have these and these can stand in and the next time I go to my mom's in Long Island when I take my bike on the train this is going to allow me to just bring one pair of shoes and this one pair of shoes is going to be great for cycling it's going to look awesome as far as casual sneakers go and I'm going to be able to walk five or more maybe even 10 miles these shoes are very comfortable with that removable insole so this shoe does a lot for me and I'm super psyched on it so if you're into the Vans old school or the Vans authentic or the Vans slip-ons I can highly recommend the Vans skate Edition there remember they used to be called the pro version but these are the skate version super comfortable super durable your feet aren't going to overheat and overall you can make do with less things your super stylish Vans shoe is going to be an awesome walking shoe as well so this shoe is pretty awesome for me and if you like wearing Vans because of their stylish aesthetic this shoe is going to be pretty awesome for you too and I can highly recommend them thanks for watching for,2025-06-23 14:38:20.397399 UTC
hDPQIRWT8as,Adidas Superstar,this shoe has been around since 1969 and it's iconic looking super wet style has withstood the test of time but does that make it a good station i don't know if we find out together this is my review of the adidas superstar hopefully my opinion in this video will help you decide whether or not you want to get a pair of these shoes for yourself let's start this video off by being honest with each other right i know that you know that you've probably seen me doing a shoe review in the past so if you have not done so yet make sure you hit that subscribe button for new shoe reviews every single week at the highest quality possible so leave a comment leave a like and let's talk about these shoes and of course this video is not sponsored so nobody's paying me to tell you anything about these shoes but that also means i had to buy them myself for 80 dollars and if you find yourself so inclined that you want to try them out then i'll leave an affiliate link for you and down in the description below but that also means i ain't just gonna be trying to sell you these shoes right i'm still gonna tell you all the bad things as well as the good things now that we have all of that out of the way these are all the features for the superstar a lace enclosure a leather upper a shell toe shoe a rubber cup sole it's imported i got mine in a black white in kind of an off-white color way adidas typically makes really comfortable shoes so i was overwhelmed when i put my feet in these shoes and realized they're really uncomfortable the insole is pretty much trash and the padding on the inside of the shoe uh i'm still trying to find it because it seems like it doesn't exist at the same time i feel like i could have gone a half size smaller but they were uncomfortable to begin with so i wouldn't want them to fit too tight i feel like a half size smaller would just add to that uncomfortable feeling that they gave me recently i feel like a lot of people have been skating these shoes and they always look really cool and as a matter of fact i think these are some of the coolest looking shoes that i've skated to this cup sole not only held my foot in place very well but there does feel like there's a very solid piece of something back here that also holds your heel quite nicely the outsole on this shoe is pretty thick while at the same time still being thin enough that i could feel the edge of my board these shoes felt really stiff when i started skating them and for me that's a huge plus because you know i like my stapatos nice and stiff i'm happy to report that that stiff feeling lasted the entire duration of me skating these shoes they look so clean and fresh when i slid them on my feet for that first session but by the end of the day they literally look like they were already beat to hell i'm not going to cap i was worried whether or not this rubber shell toe is going to react positively or negatively the way that i flick my tricks it didn't really take more than five minutes for me to realize that i could flick it however i want with these shoes if i flick fast it'll flick fast flex slowly slow but it did feel like it wasn't as snappy as other shoes that i've skated in the past but i will say i definitely had a good time skating them as for the tread on the bottom of the superstar it's like any other adidas traditional tread it doesn't have anything crazy or new or that tech the tread is basically just tread i will say though that it was grippy and i didn't feel like i was slipping around even at a skatepark and all the grooves in the tread lasted the entire time that i've been skating them but what didn't last and what's not gonna last is the entire upper of this shoe i've been skating these shoes for a week and in that week i've torn through the lace enclosure started to rip off one of these stripes and not to mention tore one of the laces through already i don't get why ain't nobody make some goddamn good laces at least put the laces in a place that's not gonna rip or just make some goddamn good laces so if you wanna shoot it's gonna last you a long time it's not this guy he's in a little bit look good a little while then just going he's gone he's not good so i tested how they flicked i know they're not gonna last a long time but most importantly i did jump down some things with this guy i was pleasantly surprised that after jumping down a little gap for a while my feet didn't hurt at all but keep in mind i was doing an ollie and landing on the board every single time so the impact protection is actually pretty manageable but at the same time i wouldn't be jumping down anything that big with these protect your feet get like footprints gellings or something some just get some one thing i gotta stop you on is inside on your insole you write the brand with the three stripes for skateboarding i agree you do make really good skate shoes but at the same time if you're gonna repurpose some old shoes that look really cool into skate shoes then put some more padding in them make them a lot more durable and protect these damn laces all right i'm tired of ripping laces the entire time that i was skating these shoes they felt stiff but solid but not flimsy while at the same time being broken in so it's like you get a good shoe that's very solid while at the same time not being really flimsy and broken in so if you like that soggy shoe feeling that you get after skating a shoe for a while then you probably ain't gonna like these but if you like your shoe to stay really solid the whole time you skate it then it's probably a good shoe for you i'm not gonna tell you that you should get this shoe or you shouldn't get this shoe i personally got this shoe because you guys left comments of what shoe you wanted me to skate next and a lot of you wanted me to skate this one and i totally agree because this is a really cool looking shoe so leave your comment down below let me know what shoes you want me to review next there will be an affiliate link for this shoe in the description as well and also i will leave a link in the description to the saudi post on my

dntmuB6kw_A,Air Jordan 1,this shoe is sneaker of the Year there I said it what's up everybody I'm Seth Fowler and today I'm reviewing the upcoming Air Jordan one Chicago lost and found there's been a lot of really strong sneaker releases this year there's been a lot of great new tech there's been exciting new designs and there's even been some really solid Retros however none of those sneakers have the story or the looks or the history that this sneaker has in my opinion this sneaker is the full package and that's why it's the best sneaker of the year so far for the last year and a half since we heard that we might be getting a retro of the Chicago Air Jordan 1es I've been heavily anticipating this shoe in fact this shoe has been number one on my list of my most anticipated sneakers of 2022 I've been waiting for this shoe for a long time I mean realistically since the last Chicago release back in 2015 and man I've got to say this shoe does not disappoint this shoe absolutely lives up to the height now after gassing this shoe up for the last couple minutes I'm sure you're wondering how you can get your hands on a pair of Air Jordan 1 Chicago lost and founds well originally this shoe was supposed to release at the end of October however Jordan brand has since pushed back the release date to November 19th 2022 and unfortunately because this shoe is a special edition or maybe even a more premium version of the Air Jordan 1's it does come with a slightly higher retail price of 180 bucks the good thing is though this shoe is absolutely worth that price unfortunately for me though that's not the amount that I paid I grabbed my pair on Goat because they had a pair on instant ship for an amount that I'm honestly kind of embarrassed to say so I'm not going to and I did accidentally buy two pairs so now I have an extra pair which I'm not exactly sure what I'm going to do with yet I may give it away so if you guys are interested in possibly winning a pair of these for yourself make sure to hit that subscribe button if you haven't yet because if I do give it away I will announce it on the channel also if you're crazy like me and you want to grab a pair of these early I've made sure to leave an affiliate link to goat in the top of the description below as much as I love this shoe the amount that I paid was was probably not worth it before we get into the sneaker though let's first take a look at the Box because the packaging is one of the reasons why this sneaker is so great so obviously because this is a special edition release Jordan brand did decide to change things up pretty dramatically on the box and on the packaging so there are two things that will immediately catch your eye about this box the first is that the Box stop and the Box are mismatched and the second is that the way that Jordan brand printed the design on the box it gives this box a very old and distressed look which I absolutely love and the reason for these changes is actually the story or the inspiration behind this entire package and that's that this box and even shoe is designed to look like it's been lost in storage in the basement of a mom and pop shop for the last 30 plus years hence the name lost and found from what I've heard the design of the sneaker and the design of the packaging is meant to pay homage to the mom and pop shops of the ' 80s and the 90s unfortunately mom and pop shops are not as prevalent as they once were a lot of that has to do with the fact that Jordan brand is no longer sending stock to Mom and Pop shops because they're trying to sell more online because they have much better margins but that's neither here nor there so like I said the idea behind this shoe was that this was an Air Jordan 1 that went on sale back in the 80s and then it was lost in storage they didn't even have an original Air Jordan 1 box stop to throw on this Air Jordan 1 Chicago box so they used a random Nike box top and the whole idea behind this sneaker and the story behind this shoe is really really interesting and I love it on the front of the box there is actually a really cool set of sale stickers to let you know that this shoe went on sale but unfortunately because I bought this pair from goat they decided to cover up that detail with their goat sticker which sucks but uh at least you can still sort of see the outline of the sale stickers so there's that in addition to those sales stickers you also have the size tag as you can see I grabbed a size n which is my true size and the official colorway of this shoe is Varsity red black sale muslin before we move on from the box I do want to show you guys some other really cool details that can be found inside and the first is this really cool receipt that's designed to look like an old 80s Mom and Pop Shop receipt now the first thing I noticed about this receipt was actually the price paid for this pair of sneakers and that price was $14.99 which sounds crazy now but back in August 30th of 1986 it wasn't too insane for a pair of sneakers that was on sale the receipt says Air Jordan basketball shoes paid cash final sale received by Leah n another interesting detail is that the name of the Mom and Pop Shop Sandy Bros is actually a nod to some of the designers of the Air Jordan 1 and then the other detail that I love inside the box is actually the paper so the paper is designed to look like old Jordan ads in fact I think they might have actually taken old Jordan ads collaged them together and then printed them on the paper and it's a really really cool detail I absolutely love it oh also one other detail I wanted to mention is that inside the shoes when you first get them they don't come with a cardboard insert instead they come with just paper which in my opinion is just something good to know if you're buying these sneakers in the aftermarket and you want to legit check your shoes if they have cardboard in them they're not legit but now let's get back to the sneakers themselves my most anticipated shoe of 2022 I can't believe I'm holding these it's crazy so first things first this shoe is a Chicago Air Jordan 1 the original colorway of the Air Jordan 1es the first released back in 1985 now I guess technically this shoe isn't really a true retro of the Air Jordan one Chicago it's not like the 2015 pair that was just a re-release of the original this shoe has a new story behind it it's a little bit aged it's got some cracked leather the story behind this shoe is a little bit deeper than a standard pair of chagos and because of that I'm not sure if this is like the next Chicago retro that we're going to get or if we're going to get one two years down the road that's much more standard than this pair speaking of Retros of Chicago 1es I do have the 2015 pair right here just to compare for you guys to give you guys a quick overview of how these shoes differ so as you may be able to tell the shape of these two shoes is a little bit different it seems like the 2015 pair is ever so slightly higher than the newer version of the shoe there is definitely differences in the leather on the 2015 pair you do have a lot of tumbled leather it's a pretty standard Air Jordan 1 whereas on the 2022 lost and founds you do have a lot of cracked leather which we'll get into later on in the video and then the red leather is much more stiff a lot more similar to the 1985 versions of the shoe or the recently released 1985 versions of the shoe the shades of red are very similar between these two shoes however on the 2015 pair the white panels and the white areas on the shoe are very bright white whereas on this newer 2022 lost and found version of the shoe the white portions of the shoe actually come in a much more cream or off-white color from a distance they are very similar looking shoes I mean the color way is the same the silhouette is very similar but when you start looking at these shoes up close you do notice a lot of differences but now let's dive a little bit deeper into the materials that make up the lost and found Air Jordan Ones so around the toe of the sneaker on the mud yard you've got this really nice deep Chicago red leather and like I was saying earlier the leather used on the red panels of the shoe is much more similar to the leather used on the recently released 1985 versions of the shoe it's a little bit stiffer it's not really tumbled and it actually much more closely resembles the leather used on the original release of the shoe and I actually think it's a pretty decent leather especially for $180 shoe it's not the best leather in the world but it's definitely a step up from really any of the leather that we've had on recent Air Jordan 1's it also smells really good too it smells like a leather shop it's crazy I love it moving up from the red leather panels you've got this cracked sail colored leather on the toe now I'm not usually the biggest fan of cracked leather I've said that in my amam maner Air Jordan reviews because a lot of those shoes feature cracked leather and the reason for that is because over time I found that cracked leather literally cracks off and almost looks like shoe dandruff it's kind of gross but what's nice about this is that this leather doesn't seem to be overly cracked to where it will start peeling off very quickly and also it really fits with the story of the shoe because this is what this leather would be doing after 30 plus years and also like I mentioned before this panel is not a true white but instead is much more of a sale color again to mimic the Aging of a pair of shoes it would have been satin storage for 30 plus years continuing up even farther on the shoe you've got more of these red leather panels on the ey IE stay of the sneaker and then weaving through the IE stay at least when you first get the shoe you've got a set of white laces and a set of black laces prestarted in the sneaker now one of the interesting details about this release is that unlike standard Air Jordan 1 or recent Air Jordan 1 releases you don't have lace bags instead the two sets of laces are actually woven through the bottom two eyelets of the sneaker which I'm assuming is a call back to the original releases of the shoe as you can see the shoe comes with a set of white laces and a set of black laces and I decided to just go with the black laces because that's what I usually wear with my Chicagos then underneath the laces you've got this salec colored nylon Air Jordan one tongue which I'm sure is designed to look aged at the top of the tongue you've got this red tag with the Nike Air logo embroidered into it in white and another difference that I noticed between this pair and the 2015 pair is that the font of the air teex seems to be a little bit thinner on this pair which I'm assuming again is designed to look like The Originals then moving inside the sneaker you've got this black fabric sock liner which is pretty standard for Air Jordan 1es and is also pretty well paded which I appreciate and then rounding off the inside of the shoe you've got a white insole with the Nike Air branding printed on the heel in red one other detail that I thought would be kind of interesting to mention and to show is the tag inside the sneaker now what's interesting about this tag is that it actually shows you the dates that this sneaker was manufactured and according to the tag looks like these Air Jordan 1 Chicago lost and founds were manufactured between February 23rd 2022 and May 18th 2022 which is actually a little bit earlier than I would have expected I guess it makes sense with the original October release date and it also makes sense as to why you can grab pairs of these early on goat and at Sneaker events and places like that but I am honestly kind of surprised I would have thought there would have been more leaked images of this shoe by now but there isn't but now let's get into sizing and fit which I'm sure a lot of you are wondering about so in my opinion the shape of this silhouette is kind of a mix between the recent air Jordan 1 releases and the recent Air Jordan 1 1985 it's kind of got that straighter heel line that you find on the 1985 pairs but it's also still got that sort of hunched forward look from the newer pairs it really seems like a mix of both I'm not sure exactly why they didn't decide to go one way or the other but it is what it is either way the good news is this shoe does seem to fit true to size and just like every other pair of Air Jordan ons however as I always say if you don't already own a pair of Air Jordan 1es I do suggest trying on a pair in your local Foot Locker or something like that does not have to be this colorway just to make sure that you're grabbing the right size for you especially if you're grabbing this shoe for resale also I don't know if you peep the fire socks in the on fooot portion of this video but those socks are from my sock brand Apothecary at Apothecary we create your sneakers favorite socks they're incredibly comfortable they come in a bunch of different colors and they look great with all of your sneakers so if you want to try out a pair of your sneaker new favorite socks make sure to click the link to apothecary's website in the description below continuing back on the sneaker to the midfoot you get to another sail colored cracked leather panel and of course Landing in the center of this panel you've got this black leather Nike Swoosh moving towards the heel of the shoe you've got more of these red leather panels and then on the lateral side of the sneaker you've got the wings logo in matte black now what's interesting about this wings logo is that unlike with standard Air Jordan 1es or more recent Air Jordan 1es this logo isn't debossed into the material and then filled with sort of a glossy paint Instead This wings logo is much more similar to the original Air Jordan 1es and the Air Jordan 185s in that it's embossed outward and then painted with the matte paint I actually much prefer this treatment I know it's just really a reversed version of what we usually get but I just think it looks cleaner on the shoe then moving around to the top of the ankle collar you've got this glossy black cracked leather now unlike with the white cracked leather this black cracked leather actually allows you to see through to the leather underneath in this case the leather has sort of a light brown or tan color which gives this heel area a bit more of a distressed look and I'm not going to lie when I first saw images of this shoe I was mad that they did this detail I felt like it was unnecessary there was too much going on but now that I understand the story of this shoe while I don't love this detail visually I really do think it does add to the story of the shoe and if they hadn't done this it wouldn't have really fit with the whole aesthetic then moving down on the shoe you get to your standard Air Jordan 1 midsole however this time around it doesn't come in a bright white and instead comes in sort of a cream colored sail it's actually a slightly more aged color than the leather found in the upper of the shoe which makes sense because rubber does usually yellow faster than leather and then finally getting to the bottom of the shoe you've got this Red Rubber outsole which seems to be sort of marbled with this kind of light gray color which does give the bottom of the shoe sort of a Dusty or old look which again really ties in well with the story I meant what I said at the beginning of this review this shoe for me is sneaker of the year I don't see any other release even coming close to this shoe and hey maybe I'm biased maybe I love this shoe because the Air Jordan one is my favorite sneaker of all time and the Chicago colorway while I don't love it as much as the bread Air Jordan Ones is right up there with it so yes maybe I'm biased but you have to admit that the story behind this sneaker the packaging and all the little details that went into this shoe really make this one of the best all-around sneaker releases of the entire year this sneaker is straight fire and in my opinion it deserves all the hype that it gets unfortunately because this shoe is going to be so hyped up I'm sure it's going to be very difficult to grab a pair of these for retail and the resale price of this shoe is probably going to be stupid so just keep that in mind if you want a pair of these just stay on top of all the release information and uh enter all the Raffles you can that's all the advice I can give you but at this point I would love to know your thoughts on this shoe so make sure to let me know in the comment section down below and as always thank you so much for watching make sure to subscribe if you haven't yet and I'll see you all in the next one n n,2025-06-19 08:40:09.360279 UTC
hS8SsgdHg2o,Adidas Samba,this shoe right here is probably one of the most popular shoes on the market right now and I can see why it's good zakaragi back at it again and today we have another episode of toilet reviews the series where I push you on a toilet then review it for all of you guys out there so for today's episode we have these guys right here so these are the Adidas Samba OG in the classic black colorway so very trendy and classic shoe right here so without further Ado guys let's see if these are worth the hype let's get straight into the review so these are tick tock's favorite shoe right now you've probably seen a million how to style videos or reasons why you should be buying these for summer 2023 so they're widely seen as a trendy fashion shoe and I believe a lot of popularity and hype behind the shoe comes from a lot of big name celebrities seen wearing these as well as so many dope collabs that have used this shoe like the sporty and Rich and kid collaboration with Clarks as well but what a lot of people actually don't know about this shoe that it has a rich history dating back to the late 40s when it was initially released as a football shoe or boot I don't know exactly what to call it maybe you football players can correct me in the comments down below but it was released as such for the 1950s FIFA World Cup in Brazil where it actually got its inspiration for its name because the samba is a type of music genre slash type of dance originating from Brazil so Adidas named the shoe the samba to appeal to the people of Brazil for the World Cup and that's how it got its major popularity back then because it was an instant classic so that's sort of a condensed history lesson for you guys there I really suggest looking up the full history of the shoe because it's awesome and it's a really great story but I just think it's crazy that all these years later the shoe is still so popular and it's actually stated Adidas's roster from back then all the way until now so that's just amazing now moving on to the materials and it's very basic as it features a full grain leather upper on the underlay as well as some suede overlays on the toe area you'll also notice the classic three stripe and Samba branding on the side of the shoe so the leather and suede used feel very soft to the touch making it comfortable on foot and they both have good quality actually and because of how good the materials are this just makes the shoe way more versatile in my opinion so if you want to dress this shoe up or down so if you're going for that more elevated look versus that more casual athleisure look this shoe has got you covered so let's just makes the shoe more worth it for me to buy in my opinion at least and especially over other trendy shoes like the Nike Dunk for example because that shoe had terrible quality materials guys like some of the leather they use on those shoes just felt like cheap plastic on foot but just like many older models cushioning wasn't very prevalent due to the lack of tech in the shoes and that's exactly the case with the Adidas Samba so what we have here is just a rubber cups soul and an insole that's all you're getting for cushioning and although it's not the greatest it's no different from a Nike donk or Converse Chuck Taylor or even a pair of Vans old school so you'll probably wear it anyways and get used to the feeling but if you really wanted to you could always replace the insoles within the sambas and replace it with a very comfortable insole or orthotic just to make the shoes more comfortable for your liking moving along to the outsole we have that traditional Samba traction pattern that made it so popular with all the football players and it was initially designed with the harsh European winter in mind and finally for fit they do feel narrow but I went through the sides on these so I'm normally a 10 that's what I got with the sambas and they fit me just fine but wide Footers try these on because you might want to go a half size up but overall guys moment of truth I personally don't think these are worth the hype unfortunately to me it's just such a basic and simple shoe there's really nothing special about it at all unless you're getting the collaboration pairs but even then all you're getting from those pairs are slightly better materials different colorways and just a higher price tag so all in all guys just not worth it for me in my opinion so I am happy however that this shoe is now in the Limelight because it's replacing the Nike Dunk and New Balance by 50 finally so we're finally over that era of shoes into the new era with the Adidas sum of OG's back here so let me know what you think about these in the comments down below do you think that they're worth the hype comment down below and let me know so for that point of the video guys now it's time for hashtag zacharagi today guys I have the Adidas byw select right here in the Galen green Philippines colorway one of my favorite hoop shoes to play in right now if you haven't seen my video on that link will be up here but that's it for today guys I appreciate each one of you guys for watching I'm signing out peace,2025-06-19 08:41:00.462342 UTC
xSapYgflu1U,Veja Esplar,today I'm doing an ultimate review of vasia sneakers so I'll be reviewing the Vasa Campo the ESL the v10s and the Rio Bronco I hope I'm pronouncing everything correctly I'm sorry if I didn't this video has been on my list to do since I purchased my first pair which was like a couple years ago my first ever sneaker I've ever invested into and I fell head over heels for them I love the design the quality so Chic and stylish know they are in investment so that's why I wanted to do a review for you guys four different popular pairs of which I've had for almost 2 years other two I wanted to uh purchase as a new pair to review and compare not sure if I'm going to keep them but I did want to have a couple different styles to compare and they have even more options to choose from but I feel like these are probably their most popular if you are new don't forget to subscribe for more weekly videos I love doing reviews like this especially on Splurge items go ahead and start with the real Bronco which here they are I really want to keep these I I truly really want to keep these I love them so much the color combination is so pretty and these don't need breaking in because they're very soft and stretchy great if you have wide feet good if you have narrow feet as well because you can just adjust the ties I noticed it has cleats at the bottom and once I put them on and started walking around in them I'm like okay why don't all of my shoes have these on them they provide such a good traction and the tongue of the shoe is suede very soft very very soft I would say these are probably the softest ones out of all of them they're thin soft they have good support on the insole as well very good traction at the bottom so for a sporty sneaker I am very very pleasantly surprised and I'm very tempted to keep them very like I said and I would say these run true to size although a lot of reviews say if you're in between sizes go up a size I've read countless of reviews saying all the same thing I just purchased my regular size and they fit great but I'm one to be very true to size true to my size six am happy staying true to size and I would recommend you know if you're splurging on something like this and you want to try multiple sizes try to get it from a site that offers free returns so that way you can consider maybe ordering two sizes your true size and your size up so that way you can just compare and get a better fit that way because these are an investment and it just suck to settle for something this is genuine suede leather here and I want to point out vesa does real leather and faux leather so always look at the description when you are purchasing sneakers from them because the pricing is exactly the same keep that in mind uh because I have one pair of sneakers here that is faux leather from vasia I will tell you which ones those are but these ones that I purchased the Rio Bronco these are genuine leather I love these TBD if I will keep these or not I'm so tempted but they are very wonderful I do love them next ones are the v10s my beloved v10s these out of the two that I've owned for 2 years are my most worn I just love the sporty athletic Vibe you can see on the stle here they have uh like stitching and lines running through it just to give it more of a sporty look toe of the shoe they have all these air holes in them as well you can tell these are pretty worn in I probably should clean these but I wear them so often it's crazy this one I would say the tongue is thin are a lot of reviews complaining that it's pretty stiff however I have been wearing these so much that the tongue of the shoe actually softened over time so it doesn't bother me at all uh so I know with these sneakers they're definitely stiff when you first get them in but they do wear over time and these are the ones that are faux leather so this one comes in a real leather and faux leather option so just keep that in mind whatever your preference is from what I've noticed having faux leather and real leather they do wear and stretch out the same but they still maintain their shape really well I would say if you're really comparing the real leather the full leather uh you'll notice that the real leather obviously is softer but they look so similar and we're pretty the same it's just the real leather's obviously much softer a lot of people say these run big which in my experience they did run big for me so I went with a size five so I went down to size and they fit me perfectly so if you are in between sizes consider going down a size in the v10s and I also want to point out if you have average to wide feet Asia makes v10s like what I'm sharing here that are great for average or wider feet but if you have more narrow feet I've read the reviews online that the v12s are better if you have narrow feet they look very similar to the v10s but based on reviews I've never tried them but based on reviews the v12s Apparently better for more narrow feet so I just want to point that out I have average to wide feet so these were great for me next up I'll be actually reviewing the vesa Campo and the vesa espar side by side they're very similar quartz sneakers by the brand they are different so both are genuine leather and the cample ones are in the off-white to tan color combo so putting it on the screen here the ESL are the white and black colorway so the Campo style I've had the longest just about 2 years also and first I love the color way the off white with the tan just so stunning I love the sole of the shoe and then it's very comfy on the inside and then with the tongue of the shoe it has a little bit of a padding to it so it's so comfortable and soft and these were stiff when I got them in but even with them being stiff they didn't really need any breaking into but they did wear and stretch over time and they just hold their shape still really well very easy to clean and really just such a great sneaker especially for something that's so so many different wardrobe pieces and comes in so many different colorways beasa espar they obviously are new so I can't give like my full detailed review because I just got them in but just comparing the differences between the two tongue of the esar here they are stiff uh so this one will probably soften over time since this one that I picked up are genuine leather and that always softens and wears over time I mean just comparing the two sneakers here they're both genuine leather one I had for almost 2 years the other one I just got you can see the differences it does stretch out and wear over time and get softer which personally I love because then the sneaker is even more comfortable but on the inside of the sneaker I would say maybe the Campos are a little bit more comfortable they have a little bit more padding into them that also could be they just got softer over time then the biggest difference I noticed between the two sneakers is the platform so putting them side by side here my beloved Campo have a higher platform and the Es are more flat so it obviously depends on person preference but me being petite I love a good platform shoe tample style is the reason why I landed on this one because I loved the platform I loved the thicker sole it just looked really cool and up to-date and kind of modern and also gave me a little bit of extra height and both of these are true to size I got them in my true size six everything is in my true size six except for the v10s those I did go down a size and I almost never go down a size in shoes I'm very very true to size six so that was very surprising I had to go down to size in those that's why I always emphasize that these I say true to size they're absolutely perfect and I love them I mean they are super similar I mean if you look at them side by side they are very very similar um but the biggest thing for me is the platform I know everybody looks for different things as far as Sneakers but that's the biggest thing for me the Campo style has the higher platform which for me is great as a petite and I think it just looks a little bit more elevated so for anyone that is interested in investing into vasia sneakers I really hope this was a helpful detailed review for you guys I know they are such an investment for a sneaker I truly love it I think they just really completed my wardrobe and just really elevated my style so for me they're worth it have everything linked down below so you guys can check it out for yourself I'll try to link it from

9efeyruWZ24,Stan Smith,today I'm talking about one of Adidas most iconic shoes the Stan Smith's and I'm comparing the Stan Smith's to the Stan Smith luxes what's the difference which one is better should you buy either of them well that's what I'm talking about on this video right here hey it's Kurt welcome to my channel where I review Fitness Products through a cost analysis on them and then give them my own rating from my own rating system to see if the item is worth purchasing or not I buy all my products with my own money for unbiased reviews although sometimes I am given a product for free if that's the case I will always let you know at the beginning of the video now I bought these Stan Smith's about eight months ago nine months ago because I just wanted a simple everyday walking shoe and they've worked out great there are a lot of things I liked about them from their comfort to their old school style and their price I also get a lot of compliments when I wear them from people in their 20s all the way up to their 50s they obviously still have that cool aura about them in my opinion they are low-key understated and have a sense of style and class that are unreplicated by any other shoe I think the closest iconic shoes to the Stan Smith are maybe some old school Air Jordans so this is what I got in September they were 95 five dollars back then now they are a hundred dollars inflation of course they have a vegan upper and an outsole made of rubber waste it is also made with prime green a series of high performance recycled materials fifty percent of the upper is recycled content with no virgin polyester it seems like Adidas basically has changed the Stan Smith's for the better of the environment and I can't fault them for that but what if you didn't want to wear a shoe with all this recycle stuff in it and you just wanted to wear a pure leather version what could you buy then these the Stan Smith luxes like I did the Lux is crafted with buttery soft leather from the inner lining to the extra leather patch and the heel that provides heightened comfort and durability in addition the foil branding on the tongue has a simple yet elegant finish it's billed as the classic Stan Smith shoe with luxury details and premium leather I opted for the crystal white off-white core Black Version because I want to make sure that the two shoes look different enough when I was testing so you guys could tell the difference I also wanted a shoe that was a different color so I could wear them along with my green ones the price 145 dollars but I did notice there was a 160 dollar version of the same exact shoe and that's if you got the cloud white Wonder white chalk White Version so what were the parameters of this test kind of simple really I've had these for like I said about eight months I've had these for about a week I wore these every day last week I've worn these for eight months so is it a fair comparison not exactly but enough time to give you at least my first impressions of these shoes now let's look at each shoe individually so you can kind of get the whole picture first the Stan Smith's vegan upper outsole made from rubber waste the Stan Smith Luxe leather upper outsole made from rubber as well the outsoles of both shoes actually look the same as well as the bottom of the shoes I'm not sure if both shoes outsoles are made the same but they look really similar back to the Stan Smith's the pull tab looks like it's vegan as well and the top line or color kind of looks like this now the tongue is made of one piece with no stitching and appears to be made of vegan materials on the Stan Smith luxes the pull tab looks like it's made of leather also on the top line or collar it looks very different than the Stan Smiths it looks like there's a lot more detail put into it the pull tab black leather almost folds over into another piece of leather that separates the outside of the shoe from the inside of the shoe now the tongue is also one piece but it's got stitching around it which makes it look a little more premium the insole of the Stan Smith looks to be made of something other than leather and it's got the prime green and plastic waste logo in it this is a funny thing to say but the laces look a little puffier almost like they're not as nice as the laces on the Luxe model and then of course on the back of the pull tab you've got the white Adidas logo here's where the Stan Smith luxes kind of start giving you those premium things that add to the whole Allure of this shoe it has an inner extra leather patch that's off-white for more comfort in the heel an embossed black logo on the rear of the pull tab the insole appears to be made of leather with the classic Adidas logo and it has the brand with the three stripes brand copy line in it and the way the shoe comes together at the back is different as well you'll see that there's only one stitching line in the luxes and there's an extra piece of material back there with three stitchings on the Stan Smiths and in the Luxe model you'll see on the outside of both uppers that the name Stan Smith is printed on them after that examination both shoes let's get to some questions I had about them and you might have about them as well which ones were more comfortable this was a lot harder to decide than I thought at first I thought for sure the Stan Smith's would be less comfortable than the Stan Smith luxes I was kind of wrong about this they do have slightly different feels but they're both comfortable I did notice that when I was wearing the luxes they were incredibly comfortable and I would probably give them maybe I don't know one more point for Comfort after wearing them all day at my office I totally forgot I had them on they're just so comfortable they just mold right to your feet and they don't have this huge Heel To Toe drop but they have enough padding where your feet aren't going to get sore through the day walking on concrete so slight Edge and comfort to the luxes but not by much are they an everyday shoe yeah I'd say both of these are an everyday shoe and that's what I said before I got two different colors because I could wear these every single day with different outfits if I wanted to and I really like them a lot I don't think I need any more of these Adidas Stan Smith or else I risk being named as the Stan Smith dude how did you keep them clean well I've had these Stan Smiths like I said for about eight months I just washed them with water today I do have a few Marks here that I can't get out with water but I'm going to use isopropyl like 99.9 percent and that usually works pretty well but that's the great thing about not having a leather shoe when you get marks on it you just get some isopropyl wipe it off no problem you don't want to do that with leather shoes that's for sure because it might do something weird to the leather you probably want to get some nice leather shoe cleaner which I will buy for sure for the Lexus when they get kind of marked up do you see a lot of people wearing them incredibly even though this is one of Adidas most popular shoes I don't see them around that much and that's what I like about them as well and people still make comments say hey nice shoes they are literally the only shoes I have that anybody's ever said anything about that doesn't really matter much but it does make me feel slightly cooler any weird things about the shoe here's something that maybe you don't think about but I think about or maybe you do think about but there's something about the smell of a leather shoe it's really nice I mean you don't smell the shoes when you're walking but when you get them out of the box then you smell that leather wow that's a that's attractive I had nothing weird happened to me with the basic Stan Smith but the Stan Smith luxes I did have something weird happen sometimes leather shoes develop some sort of squeak when you walk and it's really annoying because they look really nice and you'll be walking down the hallway with somebody in here this kind of ER so I did develop a slight little squeak in my luxes which I'm totally bummed about I don't even know how to get rid of that it's kind of like having squeaky brakes on your car impossible to fix by the way the normal stance Miss no squeaks whatsoever is there anything to watch out for when purchasing I know a lot of shoes have weird sizing so like if you're a 10 you might be an 11 another shoe or if you're a 10-1 shoe you might be a nine in another shoe I wear a size 10 shoe and I ordered a size 10 shoe and it fits perfectly another thing to keep in mind is since the Stan Smith shoe is so popular they're coming out with tons of different models of them so be very careful before purchasing make sure you're buying the right shoe with that being said let's get to the pros and cons of both of these shoes first the pros for the Stan Smiths they're comfortable they're a great price at a hundred dollars easy to clean and they stay white for a long time on their own they're made of vegan leather and made of 50 recyclables here's a Pros for the Stan Smith luxes all leather great subtle accents on the shoe that give them a premium look and they're very comfortable now the cons for the Stan Smiths not as nostalgic looking don't look as premium here's the cons for the Stan Smith luxes they're higher maintenance to keep them clean I got a little squeak from them when I walked and this is a personal peeve of mine I don't like a lot of branding on shoes I like them clear of branding and on the luxes they put the name Stan Smith on the shoe as if to say hey everybody remember these are Stan Smith's and I don't really like that I like just things a little more subtle but hey that might not bother you so what's the verdict which pair would you choose if you could only choose one believe it or not I'd have to give the regular Stan Smith a slight Edge and then right them as an 8 out of 10. although I love the Stan Smith luxes they're just a little more high maintenance and that squeak kind of bug me so I'm going to give those a 7 out of 10. both shoes are very cool though and you can't really go wrong with either one all right I'm gonna end this video here thank you so much for watching if you like this video do me a favor

S67u-OCV29s,Adidas Gazelle,today we are going to be comparing three very popular Adidas Silhouettes we have the samb OG the gazelle and also the handb spale these retro athletic sneakers are very on Trend at the moment so today's video is hopefully going to help you decide what pair is going to be the best for you or maybe all three of them are before we delve into today's video if you are new here welcome to my channel my name is Olivia and I have lots and lots of exciting content coming out this year so make sure you are subscribed to stay updated with all of my latest content first of all we're going to take a look at the design and the silhouette of all three of these sneakers they all come from the same kind of background because they were all created and designed to be an athletic or Sports shoe the first one to release out of all three was the sambers back in 1949 they were released as an indoor football shoe this sneaker is designed to be more flexible you also have a lower neck it definitely kind of reminds me of a plimsol 20 years later in the 1960s they then released the gazelle this is a football and also a training shoe definitely in terms of the kind of design I think it's set up to be more supportive on your foot you do have the higher neck especially when you're comparing it to the sambar and 10 years later in the 1970s they then released the handball spal now this is in the name this was created for the handball sport so this is definitely a lot more robust um and it was created for those sharp movements those sharp turns in terms of colorways and sneakers I went for the most kind of typical materials and colorways that you can get so for The Sandbar I went for the classic black and white which in my opinion is definitely the best colorway for these so we have the leather and then we also have the suede accents on top but most of it is leather for the gazel there is so many colorways to choose from and also a lot of different materials as well kind of standard one I guess I went for is the suede is a rough suede I'm not usually a kind of big color vibrant girl so I did go for this kind of beige and black color way and then for the hand balls I definitely think the black and white color way and the suede is the best option to go for now comparing the toe box on all three of the sneakers they all have the t-shaped toe caps you will notice on this pair of the gazel though it doesn't extend all the way down to the sides the other Adidas gazelle indoors do however this one does not however they all are very similar now one thing that stands out on the toe box in terms of the kind of silhouette and design is that the hand wall and the Sanders are very rounded and they're also a longer the gazelle is shorter and is also wider the Sanders and handfuls do look very narrow another difference is the soles you will notice that there is a slightly different design for each of the soles and if you turn around to the bottom there is a completely different design the sambas actually have a mixed design with EVA foam and as you can see they actually have pressure points so that is more kind of focused on the design of obviously playing football the gazelle has the kind of standard Adidas hexagon design which I feel like is very very kind of basic then the handle design is a little bit more intricate we have a mixed design as well with the treeold Adidas logo in terms of branding there is only one feature that is the same and that is the classic tree foil three stripes in leather on all three of them and also they have the embossed silhouette name on top in gold now the differences in branding that we can see is mainly towards the back of the shoe so the gazelle is the only one that has the tree foil adidas logo on the wheel tab the samba does not have anything but it has some padding and the handful has absolutely nothing tongues are also completely different but in terms of branding on the tongues for the samb we have the rectangular logo for the gazelle we have the logo on the tongue that is debossed and then for the hand w we have the embroidered logo tag that is sewn on for the laces on the samba and the gazelle we have the standard flat laces for the handball we actually have some rounded laces instead in terms of the actual tongue design the samb has a leather tongue and the tongue does go quite high up the gazelle we have the same shape and the size but we have it in a different material we have synthetic material then for the handball we do actually have a different shape so this is more rectangular that's why I think it looks smaller when you're comparing it to the gazelle and the sber tongue but we have this in the suede material so it is a lot thinner and it's not kind of as stable as the other two because the other two have a thicker material holding up now if you've got to a point where you can't decide between all three of them because let's face it they are very very similar the next Factor has got to be comfortability and how do they fit on foot so I've ranked them from the least comfiest to the most comfiest so the least comfiest I would definitely say for me has got to be the sber for the sambas I went for my normal size which is a size seven I did feel that they fit kind of narrow so if you did have wider feet I would definitely recommend going up a 0.5 size I did mention mention that earlier that they do have a more narrow design and you can definitely feel that when you do try them on next I put the gazelle in the middle I definitely think it's a lot more supportive than the sambers because it has a higher cut and also the design of the shoe just feels a lot more supportive on the feet I do think that this is a very kind of standard comfortable shoe these shoes are definitely not the most comfortable shoes in the world but I don't think you know that is what they're supposed to be created for for the gazals I went true to size as well and I think they fit absolutely perfectly did really enjoy en having these on my feet and I think they look really good so that means for first place in comfortability I did put the hand balls the arch support on these are absolutely insane when I put my foot in it I just feel so much more supported it's just a personal preference of mine when I try on a shoe I like my foot to feel supported interestingly enough for these I actually went up a 0.5 size because the shop didn't have my size but they actually fit perfectly and I would recommend if you want that kind of extra little bit of toe space then go up a 0.5 size however I do think the size 7 would have also been absolutely perfect for me these were actually all roughly the same price they came in at £90 $110 because these are General releases as well you can definitely pick up some discount codes to get them cheaper than that as well so this ultimately leads to the big question if I had to pick one out of the three sneakers which one would I pick it is very hard to decide because they are similar but if I was absolutely forced I think I would go for the hand ball and the reason for that is the samba for me is definitely very much that pimo kind of vibe it's very Olden Vibes and it looks and feels like a plimp salt as well I would go for the hand ball it's kind of in a bit of a weird way a mixture of both of them I like the fact that it has the high cut neck but I also like the fact that it has the more narrow kind of toe box although these have trended massively over the last year I do think that these are Timeless Silhouettes I also love the fact that they are so versatile and absolutely anyone can wear them as well overall they are very clean sneakers let me know in the comments below which one is your favorite one thank you guys so much for watching I hope you guys enjoyed today's video and I'll see you guys in my next one what,2025-06-23 14:39:01.806828 UTC
pJcK7V9Qzjo,Adidas Superstar,today we're cutting open that classic comfy shoe one of the most iconic shoes in the world that also happens to be my dad's favorite shoe the adidas superstar now let's go over the shoe information so the brand is adidas the style is the superstars the colorway i got is the classic cloud white core black and cloud white they weigh just under a pound they retail for 85 dollars though you can usually find them for a lot cheaper especially like amazon and they are made in indonesia and the story behind these shoes is kind of interesting because most people know these as like the run dmc issue they actually have their origins back in the late 60s and early 70s when they were designed to replace the classic converse canvas basketball shoes to be one of the very first leather basketball shoes in existence and they kind of took over the basketball world and quickly almost put commerce out of business and basically became the shoe of choice for most basketball players in the 70s and then in the 80s they had that strong resurgence because of run dmc which really rocketed these shoes into super stardom farthing the pun and made these the iconic shoes that you've seen and they've basically been popular ever since in every colorway imaginable every collaboration possible and even down to my dad wearing these basically non-stop all growing up and if you want to see a really good history of these shoes check out nacho average finds video on these because it's pretty informative so now let's go over the information that we can gather about these shoes before cutting them in half starting with the leather as always so this is clearly a chrome tan leather you can tell that by the blueing in the cross section here and it says it's a full grain leather and so i doubt it's a real full gray it's probably more of a top grain because usually this style of leather with a really even finish on top they usually buff it down to get rid of any imperfections and then put the finish on top so my guess is it's actually a top grain leather which isn't that big of a difference so the best way to tell if it even has a grain is to do this little bin test where we bend it and cut a little cross section out and as you can see we can see the little pores and hair follicles in there which show which tells us that it is a full grain or top grain leather which is a higher quality leather than a suede which is going to last longer so it's pretty decent leather is it super high quality leather probably not just because of the scale that it's produced and that it's an 85 dollar sneaker but it is leather and i think the majority of this is leather it doesn't feel like the tongue is leather a lot of times they do the tongues out of a fake leather and if you look at these little black stripes and this back piece here with the adidas logo on it these are fake leather and you could tell that by just flipping up the edge and looking underneath and you can see that it's kind of a matted material it looks kind of like felt that's not leather then to the lining on the inside so the thing i really like about these is how minimal the lining is because i i don't like really warm shoes and boots so to have just the skeleton lining on the inside just at the heel of your foot and then having a very minimal lining on the inside is what i like to see anyway so not much of a lighting but that's a positive to me and it's just a fabric liner you know and then it looks like the rest of it's just a backing on the leather to kind of help reinforce it and prevent from over stretching or premature wear and then to the insert pull this out it's just a cheap eva foam insert nothing special it's removable to some degree and that's always a bonus for people who have custom orthotics or just want a little bit more squish underneath their foot and then on to the construction so this is a cup this is kind of an interesting construction because it's a cup sole but then the toe this is that that world famous shell toe is also kind of sidewall stitched on and then on the inside we can see a stroble stitch to that what looks like a foam midsole so pretty solid construction and then the midsole is a foam midsole and it feels like it's pretty thick and what's interesting is you know this insert is a really cheap open cell big celled eva foam but this midsole feels like a pretty high quality pu foam it kind of has that that spring and rebound of a memory foam type foam so that's probably part of why it's so comfortable i'm really interested to see how thick this actually is and what the structure of the sole is on the inside so really not much to this shoe it's a pretty basic shoe there might be a few surprises on the inside so i guess that leads us to the next portion of video so let's cut this thing in half honey is a free browser extension that automatically applies promo codes to your cart at checkout to save you a little bit of

how thick this foam is no wonder these things are so comfortable i thought for sure that it was maybe like this thick at the heel but and then maybe the heel was more structured like the stan smiths where you have these cells on the inside all the way across the heel but all that comfort comes from this big fat memory foam type foam at your hill that makes a lot of sense it makes me wonder what the vintage ones how they were built i'm guessing they're more built like this so maybe i'll i'll find a pair of old ones and cut them in half so we can pair we can compare like the 70s or even like 80s versions to the more current versions because this is this foam feels like it's not it's more modern foam less like this open cell foam but it is interesting that it still has that cell structure that you see in most cup soles at the edge of the cup sole and i think that's probably to give it a little bit more stability and cup your sole a little bit better better rather than just having a big chunk of foam there you also have that that lattice structure that helps prevent the shoe from being too wobbly and unstable is my guess but overall it's a pretty simple shoe you literally just have that cupsole outsole which is a little bit thinner than i expected you know a lot of these big brand sneakers have pretty thin soles and that's always what wears out first and then it goes up to that big layer of foam that's struggle stitch to the upper then we got that skeleton lining just around the heel you can kind of see better now that reinforcement behind there and then the foam and rubber counter and the leather upper and that's pretty much all there is to it as for the thickness of the leather thickness is right around 1.5 to 1.6 so pretty decent thickness it's not the thickest leather in a sneaker but it's also not super thin a lot of times you'll see in these more affordable sneakers of a leather around one millimeter or just under one millimeter now we can take a look at the shell toe and as the cross section and you can see that it overlaps with the cupsole and is glued as well as sidewall stitched all the way to the inside and it's also glued to some reinforcement and the fabric lining on the inside as well so it is it's kind of interesting to see how this is structured um at least for me i don't know if it's that interesting to anyone else but i think it's really interesting now to the pros and cons of the shoe so starting with the pros it's that classic iconic look that's been around for decades it's hard to beat for a classic old-school adidas sneaker it's super comfortable that's this is what makes it so comfortable that giant chunk of foam and the leather is pretty good it's a thick leather it's a decent leather and it's most of it is leather obviously there's a few parts that aren't but for an 85 sneaker it's pretty good i'm i'm actually really surprised you know because a lot of times i'll cut apart these big name brand shoes and they don't really live up to their price tag in my opinion but this one is is pretty close i i would say this is money well spent as for cons the outsole is a little a little bit thin just like all the other nikes and adidas out there i think they do that to save a little bit of money in production even though the leather is thick it's you know it could be improved but then again you'd be raising the price of the shoe if you want to get nitpicky some of these parts aren't leather you know i'd like to see a leather tongue it doesn't really matter but i just like leather yeah there's really not a whole lot of cons to to to point at you know for 85 dollars it's it's pretty good deal you know a lot of times these bigger brands their iconic sneakers they slowly increase the price and just hope that people don't care and they don't notice and they're willing to spend the money on the iconic sneaker but these are still under 100 bucks which is pretty cool i don't know i don't really have much to complain about i think they i think they do it well every time i open a shoe i i find some new things that i think are really interesting like the little cells on the inside here that they just are on the outside i thought that was really interesting so pretty cool video um i'm really interested in seeing a vintage one cut apart so if you're interested in that be sure to let me know in the comment section and thank you guys so much for watching these videos and all the support that you give me let me know what you think of this shoe and your experience with them and thank you for everything you do it means a lot to me and if you're not subscribed consider subscribing and thank you guys see ya you,2025-06-23 14:43:34.524803 UTC

K0V5DgZYdLE,Nike Air Max 90,today we're reviewing one of nike's most popular shoes of all time designed by tinker hatfield in the 90s the air max 90. and this hopefully should be one of the most in-depth reviews you've ever seen of this shoe hey what's going on guys my name is chris and on this channel i like to review men's clothes shoes and grooming products as a whole so if that's something you're interested in go ahead and hit subscribe and without further ado let's get straight to the point these shoes fit true to size but they are narrow so if you have a wide or a flat foot then you may want to consider going up half size just for comfort reasons the shoe is really snug all the way around from the heel to the toe the insoles are kind of stiff but they're not glued to the inside of the chute and they're easily replaceable and actually speaking of the insoles they are abnormally large and it makes the shoe feel a little bit slimmer than it already is you can see that extra bit of material that sits under where your foot arch should be and for those of you wondering these actually do add height it adds actually 1.2 inches and for most people that isn't a bad thing oh shea lash and the air max 90s features this very leveled i'm trying to get it out i'm sorry guys this is like varied level eye holes for your laces so you got some play on how you want to lace them up and style them which i like a lot this shoe is actually a lot slimmer than you would think it doesn't open up wider at any part of the shoe and the toe is rounded off even when you loosen up the laces it's still a pretty snug fit on the sides of the shoe and honestly depending on how you wear your shoes that could be a pro or a con for me it doesn't make a difference cushioning around the ankles is robust and gives a lot of padding the same thing can be said for the tongue as well it's a nice thick boy from the top to the bottom so the insole is pretty firm as far as insoles go but as i mentioned before it isn't glued to the shoe and can be easily replaced which i highly recommend by the way these shoes are gonna take some breaking in before they get really comfortable these were originally designed for running but i don't think that's the intention nike has for them anymore seeing as how on the nike website they have them listed under lifestyle instead of running so if you're looking for running shoes these ain't it these aren't the most comfortable shoes in the world i would put air force ones and karachi's above these as far as comfort but overall i would rate it about fair and they'll get the job done when i say the price will vary on these i really mean it the air max 90 retails for 120 dollars for the most basic colors like the wolf grays the all whites all blacks you get it however some colorways have really low demand and if you look around you can find some for as low as 60 dollars but on the other end of that some can go for us up to twelve hundred dollars and of course it's the off-whites and the prices on some colorways will fluctuate pretty frequently for example when i first started shopping for this light bone colorway the prices were sitting in the 150 to 170 dollar range i watched prices for about three weeks and then they dropped to about the 130 range so of course when i saw that i bought them and before shooting this video i went back and checked and saw that they're averaging again around 150 to 160 range now let's take a look at the materials of the shoes because there's just so much going on the extra eye holes on these shoes that i mentioned earlier are actually covered in a polyurethane or tpu as nike calls it along with the air max logo here the toe box is actually covered in this really thin synthetic mesh that feels like it almost has a layer of sponge in between it but i don't think it does and after that nike starts to hit you with the old razzle dazzle so the toe and the upper actually has this leather wrapping that goes from one side of the ankle all the way around to the other then the nike check itself is a different type of leather from this toe wrapping leather but it's not nubuck it's definitely not suede but again it's not the same leather as this one so i don't know what it is but it's still a different different one different one different one different one you know what i mean this back branding patch is a thick rubber that just feels so good to run your fingers across i don't know why i just like ah it's satisfying it's a really thick rubber then they finish it all off with this nice suede accent right here and i think it just ties everything together so nicely they do this every year and i say all that just to say that the material cohesiveness on this shoe is so good it's just it's probably one of my favorites and i want to note that the solid colorways usually come in leather variations as well just so you know so who are these for if you're looking for a pair of training shoes these are not it if you want some with a similar silhouette to the air force ones but not quite the air force ones then this might be something to get again i don't see why you couldn't walk around in these all day overall these are classic these are staple in anyone's closet just like the blazers just like the air force ones just like the nmdr ones so if you're looking for a shoe that blends more of that athletic look with a casual shoe i think that's exactly what these do and they do it really well and i'll probably make a hotter style video after i kind of get a feel for them a little bit more and see what they really look good with before shoe that's probably older than half the people watching this video it sure does look good,2025-06-23 11:26:29.383326 UTC
4gFrkuwJNUQ,Adidas Gazelle,today's video we have another fantastic everyday shoe we have the Adidas gazelle these are extremely popular right now so it's only necessary that I come on and give you guys a review if you are new here welcome to my channel my name is Olivia and I have lots and lots of sneak up content so if you do want to stay updated please don't forget to subscribe so for the Adidas gazelle as you can see I picked up a very bold statement color pair I've got this kind of aqua blue and white they do come in I think there's another 12 colorways so if you do want something more simple you want to check out other colors you know there's a lot to choose from the black and white obviously are a very very popular pair there's kind of a little reason why I went for this color aside from the fact that I absolutely love this blue it's very vibrant but these actually came out in 19 in the middle of the 1960s Adidas gazelle that is when we first saw them so they've been around for such a long time but I feel like in this past year you know the hype has really picked up for them and they've you know become a little bit more trendy um than maybe previous previous years when they actually first came out they were only released in two colorways there was a red and white pair and also a blue and white pair hence why I went for this color it's obviously not the exact same shade and obviously over the years they've kind of made different iterations to the Adidas gazelle to what it is today also another interesting thing about the Adidas gazelle is that this was the first Adidas shoe that was made in suede I feel like that's a little bit crazy these days because suede is a very very common material in sneakers that we see pretty much everywhere so in terms of design it is a very very classic design it has that kind of football looking sneak heart vibe to it it's a very very simple shoe as well and I must say this shoe is incredibly lightweight for me it is a very simple minimalistic kind of sneaker but it definitely gives off that kind of clean Vibe so in terms of materials on the shoe the bulk of the shoe is mainly made up of suede on the upper we also have some soft leather for the three stripes on the side of the shoe which is on either side we have the gazelle which is embossed on the outer side of the shoe as well in terms of the design the toe box is very rounded off and it's also quite a narrow shoe as well which you need to bear in mind if you do have wide feet for laces you do get a very very standard pair of laces they are quite thin for the tongue we have a nylon tongue this is in more of a kind of creamy off-white color and then at the top we do have a logo badge in the blue with the Adidas logo now taking a look inside the shoe we do actually have the soft leather lining it does go in on side usually would prefer some kind of softer cotton material but the soft leather does work then inside the shoe we do actually have a removable sock liner taking a look towards the bottom we do have a texturized rubber out so absolutely love this part of the shoe I don't know why I feel like this is one of the classic parts of it again it's just very very simple and basic but it looks so good then in terms of the bottom of the shoe we have a rubber gum so I can't lie to you there's not that much you can dislike about this shoe I don't know how anyone could not like it is very very simple these actually retail at £85 $100 which I think nowadays is such a good price again because this is such a simple silhouette you can literally wear this with absolutely anything and when I say absolutely anything I literally mean absolutely anything after trying them one I was actually quite surprised at how comfortable they were I was not expecting any comfortability whatsoever because of how kind of minimalistic they are but I was actually really surprised that they fit really nicely and I think they're very very flexible um I don't think they're very rigid and hard at all but that may change with the leather ones because leather is usually you know a bit tougher but I really enjoyed putting my foot into these and I definitely think you know I could wear them for anything in terms of you know I could wear them for sports the gym going on long walks things like that I think they would do really well in the only one thing that I can say is that suede is absolutely horrible to clean not just the idas gazel anything really that is made out of suede is horrible to clean so you do have to kind of just be think about that when you are choosing what ones you do want to buy but I do personally think that the suede looks better so for me I would definitely go for the Suede and maybe just put some shoe protection on them and but if you do get them dirty honestly there's so much kind of advice out there online of how to clean suede so I would definitely recommend this sneaker to someone who's looking for an everyday versatile kind of sneaker or also if you're looking you know to add some kind of color into your palette I think they're really decent price and also for the amount of wear you could potentially get out of them I think is good value for money these are unisex so they do cover all sizing sizing wise for these I went true to size which is a size seven which is kind of my generic size in any other brand and they fit absolutely perfectly as I said if I had to choose these do fit more on the narrow side um as I mentioned especially around the toe boook so if you do have wider feet then you could always go up a 0.5 size add us absolutely love making making iterations of classic shoes and I have seen some platform versions of gazel and I'm sure there is many other versions of gazel out there so if you do like this kind of vibe it you need something a little bit more because this is too simple it's definitely worth having a look on the Adidas website um or other retailers as to what they have done with all their other gazelle iterations personally for me I just don't know how anyone could not love this silhouette and especially on F it looks absolutely banging let me know in the comments below what you guys are saying about today's pickup thank you guys so much for watching today's video I hope you have an amazing week and I'll see you in my next video,2025-06-23 14:38:58.690139 UTC
b2dJvSbiWvI,Reebok Club C 85 Vintage shoes,uh finally for the late nights hey what's going on youtube today we're going to be looking at specifically the club c85 revenge shoes and the club memt shoes and we're going to be comparing them to the club c85 vintage shoes and the regular clip cd5s so this is pretty much going to be like a part 2 to the original club cd5 comparison video where i compared the club c85 club c85 vintage and the club c85 tv definitely go check out that video if you guys want to know more about the club cd5 tvs because i'm not going to be including them in this video so just like the last comparison video we're going to be comparing the price some visual differences leather quality color and lastly comfort after that i'm pretty much going to be giving my opinion on which ones i believe you should buy so let's get into it so starting right off the bat with the prices the club c revenge shoe retails for between about 70 to 80 depending on the colorway the club me and t shoes retail for 59.99 so they're actually the least expensive out of all of these seeing as the club c85s retail for about 70 dollars while the club c85 vintage retails for about 75 now for some visual differences starting off with the revenge shoes the most obvious difference is gonna be that striped colored underlay going across the shoe that's like the main difference but there are smaller differences like for example the leather on the regular club c85s actually looks like it is a little bit thicker than the one on the revenge shoes it's just a little bit thicker but in my opinion it really contributes to the club see having a little bit of a bulkier look than the revenge it could just be maybe it was made in a different factory and that's why the leather on these shoes seems a bit bulkier it could also just be that it's my pair that you know has a maybe thicker cut of leather uh i'm not really sure so definitely take this with a bit of a grain of salt but overall like i said bravenchu actually seems to be a bit sleeker while the club c85 shoe tends to look a little bit bulkier the opening of the revenge actually sits at the same height as the regular club c which i mentioned in my previous video that actually sits higher than the vintage shoe i feel like the overall silhouette is more similar to the vintage than the regular clip c also similar to the vintage is the fact that it has the terry cloth lining so the main difference pretty much is going to be that this one has the same cut as the regular club sees except the material seems to be a bit thinner so the overall silhouette is more like the vintage and this has the stripe going down and also the terry cloth lining so that's to be the main difference between this shoe and the regular eclipse now for the club memts the main difference on this one is going to be the fact that the upper actually has a different cut from the rest of the shoes for example it does have a similar stripe just like the revenge but it also does include a heel counter that the rest of the shoes don't have and it also has little notches on the end of the toe overlay also the rubber outsole is going to be completely different from the other club c85s it's completely absent of the little dotted pattern that it has on the other clip c85s and instead we get this kind of striped pattern on the heel also the tread pattern is completely different as well we get a nice hexagonal pattern with some stripes i also forgot to mention that the toe perforation pattern is slightly different as well also the leather is the thinnest out of all the shoes thus making it the slimmest and sleekest out of all the shoes as well now i'm not a leather expert or anything i'm just going to be explaining how i think the leather feels in my opinion on the revenge shoes the leather is pretty soft but it doesn't feel as soft as the vintage leathers these ones have a extremely extremely soft leather but it also doesn't feel as kind of stiff as the regular club sees so it really kind of feels like it's you know that middle ground so it's right in between the leather of these two shoes as for the leather on the club memts it definitely feels a bit more synthetic which is pretty much to be expected since the leather is the thinnest and it's also the least expensive out of all the shoes here if you guys want to know a bit more about the leather on the tvs like i said definitely go check out that first comparison video now on to the color for the revenge shoes the colorways definitely seem to be a bit more colorful for these ones when compared to the regular club seas they definitely use that stripe to definitely add a splash of color and to kind of help color block the whole shoe which is very different to something like the club c85 for the memts the colorways are actually a bit simpler they're very similar to something like the regular club cd5s on their website they pretty much just have kind of the basic colors colorways that are very similar to the regular eclipse 85 so the revenge has the most colorful colorways out of all the models while the club me and ts are going to have more basic colorways similar to the regular eclipses for the comfort of the shoes all the shoes are going to be comfortable but i'm obviously still going to rank them so the most comfortable shoes in my opinion are going to be the vintage club cd5s they have an eva foam midsole that's lightweight and really helps with the comfort of the shoe it also has this buttery soft leather that feels really good around the foot especially in the toe box area after that surprisingly i wouldn't pick them emts with the memory foam insole in my opinion the revenges and the regular klepsies are going to be more comfortable than the memts reason for that is that the memts have this thinner outsole so you're going to be closer to the ground and you're going to feel more of it also the memory foam insole really doesn't help much just because it compresses so easily the other two have a thicker outsole and a responsive insole so they just feel overall more comfortable kind of disappointed in the memts i was really hyped about that memory insole but maybe after breaking them in they'll feel more comfortable but for now they're gonna be the least comfortable out of the four so which one should you buy if you really like the kind of old-school styling of the club c85 the kind of original styling and you want the shoe with the most comfort you really can't go wrong with the vintages you're definitely going to want to pick up this pair if you want more kind of like the basic club c85 just pick up the regulars they come in more color ways than the vintages so the colorways are going to be more varied and these are going to be at a good price they're going to be 70 bucks so i suspect that most people are going to choose you know these two these these two are the more popular models now if you want a shoe with more varied color ways and you like that stripe down the side definitely the revenge shoes these are a solid pick and for 70 to 80 dollars depending on the colorway they might be more or less expensive but a nice plus is that you do get that terry cloth lining now if you want the most bang for your buck i would definitely recommend the memts they have a very similar styling it's not identical but it's extremely similar styling the leather quality is going to be a bit lacking but for 60 bucks it's really a good value for the shoe especially if you can get these on sale so that's gonna be it for the video i really hope you guys enjoyed the video and found it helpful let me know down in the comments if there's any other shoes you guys want me to compare or you guys would like to see on the channel i got more shoe content coming in the future so definitely look out for that and i'll see you guys in the next one let's reebok slogan be more human for real that's a pretty horrible slogan could have been something like uk's finest block whole lotta buck any of the slogans would have been a thousand times better than be more human they definitely need to change that,2025-06-19 08:38:10.194311 UTC
a2Ozd9sIh84,Onitsuka Mexico 66,unboxing the onitsuka tiger shoes I got the yellow and black colorway in perfect timing because Kill Bill just came out on Netflix I am a woman size 7 so got these in a men's size 5 1/2 and they fit me perfectly can't wait to style them this Summer,2025-06-23 14:44:49.288652 UTC
QEsKNCwx7Kg,Veja Esplar,wait are you on yes you are okay hey everyone it's lindsay today i am back with another review video this time i'm gonna be reviewing the vega esplar sneakers first heard about visja from a couple influencers maybe like a year or two ago and i just feel like it started to become more and more popular so these sneakers were about 120 and i got it off of revolve and i know that they have this style on other different sites at different prices and i'm gonna go right into the pros and cons of these sneakers and as always i'm gonna start with the pros so the first pro that i have is that i really love the style of these shoes what i really love about this style is that it has the gold v which is such like a me touch so for a while i was really set on buying the classic white vagina sneakers with the black v that i feel like a lot of people have but i came across this style i believe the color is called platine that has the gold v and i immediately fell in love what i also noticed about the brand though is that they do have a lot of different styles and they have a lot of different colors so it's really nice if you don't want just like the classic white sneakers you can get ones that are pink or blue and so forth so there's a lot of different options for you to choose from the second pro that i have is that i like the material of this because it's easier to clean and i'm going to compare this to converse sneakers i have had these white converse sneakers for years now i'm going to be inserting clips of my converse sneakers so i apologize how dirty it looks but because it has like a more canvasy material i feel like it can be kind of harder to clean although i don't know if you can put it in the washing machine i've never actually done that so if you've done that let me know whereas with the veggie sneakers you can just take like a wet cloth and then wipe it and the stain will probably come out the third pro that i have is that it's more comfortable to wear now i do have pretty wide feet and i feel like these sneakers aren't really like constricting my feet so much but also with these sneakers i did have to size half the size up that is something that the revolve side did recommend and also i did read the reviews and some people said with this style specifically to size up if you can so that's what i did and i figured it's probably better that it is a little bit bigger just depending on what socks that i wear but i do like that with the design it's not like a really chunky sneaker that has been kind of like in trending for a year or two it is like a more chunkier sneaker it's definitely like a little bigger than converse where converse is like a very slim sneaker it's bigger than that but it's not like obnoxiously big so you can probably wear it for years to come and it's comfortable to walk throughout the day and the last pro that i have is that i love how it's a more sustainable option i feel like that's how vega got to be a little bit more popular it's that it's a more sustainable sneaker so this sneaker has 100 organic cotton laces and then the insole is made out of like sugar cane organic cotton and then amazon rubber and with the esplar style it supports organic and family farming in the nordeste region in brazil so i do love that breakdown and the transparency that the brand gives you of where your shoe is coming from and what it's made out of now i'm done with the pros and i'm gonna move on to the cons and the first con that i have is that this wasn't the most comfortable to wear in the beginning now i feel like that's just such a common thing when it comes to shoes you do need to break it in but the first impression that i have was that i was actually kind of disappointed when i got the sneakers and was wearing it for the first time this like front flap here was digging in to my ankle it was like that for a while and even sometimes now after this has been broken in um it still digs into my ankle occasionally not all the time where i like really notice it but here and there it will do that the second con that i have i feel like is a very nitpicky one but i don't really like the holes where the laces go i do wish that there were grommets on the holes for the laces so that will be a little bit easier for the laces to thread through just compared to like converse where they do have grommets i wish these sneakers had grommets of some sort so be easier to unlace your shoes if you needed to the third con that i have for these sneakers is that the gold paint is starting to rub off it's not all over the shoes where it's starting to rub off it is rubbing off on the front flap over here which is understandable it's been rubbing up against the laces so now the back of the laces has a little bit of like gold paint and it's not really like super noticeable if you're standing from far away and you're looking at these shoes you won't really notice that the gold v is rubbing off but if you're very nitpicky like me sometimes that is something that you probably will notice it doesn't actually really bother me um a whole lot but that is a con that i noticed with these shoes that was it for the pros and the cons and overall do i recommend these sneakers i'm gonna say yes if you really want them honestly i haven't really found too many issues with these sneakers so far i've had them for about a couple months now i want to say like i mentioned before at first i actually was a little bit disappointed with these sneakers because they weren't really comfortable to wear at all but once you break it in it became a lot more comfortable to wear i really love the style of it and i love the gold touch of course it's just like a subtle statement and of course i love the sustainability of it i've been trying to become a lot more sustainable with different areas of my life and of course that whole thing is a process but this is another great step of the way so i do recommend these shoes if you are on the hunt for a more sustainable and better quality sneaker so that was it for this review video i hope you guys enjoyed it and found it helpful if you did please give this video a thumbs up don't forget to subscribe hit that notification bell also check me out on instagram i am always posting outfit inspiration and i have been wearing these sneakers like crazy thank you guys for watching and i will see you all in my next video bye everyone you,2025-06-23 14:57:44.785175 UTC
RlMX6LVCASU,PUMA Suede,watch before you buy the Puma suede inside of this box we have the Puma classic suede XXL xxi whatever you want to call it the classic black and white color way as you guys can see what I love about this box is they actually show you a picture of the shoe on the box that is awesome so when you have a bunch of boxes it makes it easy to know what colorway you are trying to get and here they are the Puma classic suede this is everything you guys need to know before you buy and wear the Puma suede this is a classic an iconic sneaker am I right especially in the hip-hop industry there's so many rers and hip-hop artists throughout the years that have worn this sneaker I'm talking way back over 50 years ago this sneaker was introduced and it's been a classic and a staple all of these years later what I personally love about the Puma CL uh suede in particular is that it's a classic shoe but nonetheless the suede right it has suede in the name Puma suede but the suede oh my it's so soft to the touch guys if you have not ever felt a pair of Puma suedes please do so pick a colorway and just feel the suede it is so soft to the touch they definitely use a very nice suede material I really appreciate the suede because it's very nice and speaking of nice materials let's talk about the sock liner very very nice premium sock liner nice and comfortable and leather it is so soft it's not going to get you know sweaty on your feet a lot of leather insoles it'll make your foot sweaty and disgusting after a period of time you're not going to have to worry about that with the Puma suede the one thing I will say is be careful because it will get a little dirtier because it is white here on this pair so that will get a little dirty but other than that they're going to be easy to clean and it's so damn comfortable with that leather now the Puma logo very nice and gold I really like the gold touches on the P Puma logo along with the suede very very nice and you do have the logo on the back as well the gold just stands out and what I really appreciate is that it's a real gold you know a lot of other gold shoes aren't really gold it's more like a mustard yellow but not here on this Puma classic suede they do use a real nice gold I want to say it's like a trifold gold tricolor gold whatever the word is it's a very nice gold very nice and it really stands out at you that midsole man is very very nice and I believe it's vulcanized and it's very very nice outsole I love the outsole as well it's going to get dirty but easy to clean easy to manage and take make maintain you do have the Puma logo on the bottom as well I have worn these outside and I do think they're extremely comfortable I'm excited to wear these more and I will do a wear test video so make sure you guys hit that thumbs up and make sure you guys subscribe you do not want to miss out on the wear test video of the Puma suedes so these right here are classic they're

a7xubfPvOnw,Nike Cortez,we don't have a sponsor for this video so the sponsor is roseanneville because we're discontinuing a couple of our wallets just because I got a couple really cool designs I'm working on I need to make a little bit of room so we don't have 50 Wallets on the website so we're getting rid of the row wallet and the Luton wallet and in order to liquidate some of the extra inventory we're going to do 20 off both of these wallets with the code goodbye at checkout and it's just on these two wallets and one's a bifold one's kind of like a vertical wallet and they're hand stitched by us in the shop two needles a single thread sewn them together like old saddle makers used to make their Saddles all vegetable tan leather tan by Wicken and Craig in my opinion it's the best way and the best leather to use to make a really nice wallet so check them out via the link in the description and get you get yourself a Luton or a row before you can't get them anymore so thank you guys the Nike Cortez is one of the most successful and iconic running shoes Nike's ever made that you might not have ever heard of because it was one of the very first successes Nike ever had before they're even called Nike in the late late 60s so we're going to cut this thing in half and see how it's made and test the materials to see if it lives up to that running shoe Heritage or if it's got the gotten the Nike treatment where they take all as many of the high quality materials out replace them with cheap materials hide as many things on the inside as possible to give you the facade of a classic running shoe without any of the substance so now let's go over the history of the Cortez it all started in 1966 when it was designed by Bill Bowerman the co-founder of Nike in collaboration with onitsuka tiger basically Asics as a new running jogging shoe it was and it was originally called the worst name ever the tg24 and at the time Nike was still called Blue Ribbon Sports and it was the only distributor of onitsuka tiger shoes and it wasn't even manufacturing shoes on their own and they had an exclusive contract to be the only distributor in the United States of this product and then a year later 1967 Phil Knight and Bill Barrowman talked to onitsuka wanting to change the name from the atrocious tg24 to the TG Mexico in honor of the Olympics taking place in Mexico in E7 onitsuka wasn't excited about that name so instead they landed on the name the Aztecs a callback to the Aztec history so it was a kind of a nice middle ground and the problem with that is Adidas was not happy about that name because Adidas threatened to sue stating that the Aztec was too close to their track shoe the Azteca gold which to be fair is pretty close if we're being honest so they had to go back to the drawing board and in Phil Knight's Memoir the shoe dog he quoted Bill Bowerman as saying who was that guy that kicked the out of the Aztec Phil replied Cortez and thus the name Cortez was born and it became a little bit of a cultural icon because it was seen on the feet of Farrah Fawcett and Charlie ain't Charlie's Angels Elton John George Costanza and even Forrest Gump or a pair of these so pretty unique and cool story of the evolution of Nike and how they got to the naming this shoe and even a little insight into early years of Nike so now start going through the details of the shoe starting with the leather first so we took the lighter to all the different panels starting with the swoosh first tried the swoosh clearly fake leather the little red patch on the back that's also fake leather the external heel counter cover on the back fake leather again and then the one piece you're like oh this has got to be real leather because it's the little toe bumper you're going to be bumping your toe into stuff and you want that to be leather for the durability and abrasion resistance that's fake leather too and then above that this little lace keeper layer here fake leather as well so the only real piece of leather on this shoe is this one single panel on either side all the rest is really just fake terrible leather that as soon as you get a scratch in it and Nick it all that foam underneath is just going to start falling apart it's going to just age really terribly but what is the quality of leather that is in this shoe well we cut a little slit in it and put the Mac took the macro lens to see the cross section and as you can see it doesn't have any of that structural grain pattern at the top that binds all those loose fibers together to give leather its strength that has been completely removed making this leather just loose fibers connected together with a really heavy plastic coating on top and it has a fake print in Boston embossed into it it's only one 0.2 millimeters thick and it's just the absolute worst leather that I've ever seen in a Nike this isn't that degrade range because it's super thin it has a fake leather print it has a fake plastic coating on top no grain pattern and it's just a really cheap leather through and through so the absolute worst Nike leather I've ever seen and then if we look at the rest of the shoe you know there's like a really cheap lining on the inside that you can literally just pull chunks of the fuzz off typical insole stroble stitched lasting boards all the same but one thing that is interesting is the midsole is an actual true dual density outsole for once and now on a really terrible shoe from like 50 years ago this is one of the only shoes that promotes a dual density house or midsole that actually has it even like the Lulu lemons we've cut apart the other day advertise hugely we scanned a million women's feet dual density midsole that was not true but this one is because if you look at the durometer test you can see pretty clearly that the top layer is a 35 ish short a and that blue layer is a little bit softer around 30 short eight so finally dual density and then the outsole it actually looks like it's a nice thick Rubber outsole and we'll see when we get cut in half but for the most part the midsole down looks like a pretty decent shoe it's just the upper that's a complete disaster so now let's cut this thing in half and really see what's going on on the inside to see if Nike's hiding any little little tricks on the inside of the shoe oh foreign foreign so unfortunately that thick rubber outsole that I thought was really cool because finally they have a thick outsole on a pair of Nikes is not as thick as I thought it still is not super thin by any means but I just really like the idea of having like a six millimeter thick rubber outsole on a running shoe with all the Dual density on the inside but you can see there's there's cavities in there this is there's two reasons for this it reduces weight and it makes it cheaper to produce but at least you can see that there is those two layers of foam that are two different densities running all the way through the inside of the shoe which is unique because a lot of times where these dual density outsoles it's just different colors on the outside and on the inside there's really no difference at all and then other than that it's a pretty basic shoe so overall for 80 bucks it's still a lot of money for mostly fake leather and cheap foam and a pretty thin outsole and to really put let's just see if I can rip this thing apart because it's just a cheap cemented construction and let's see how cheap the construction actually is nope okay at least it's cemented well it got to like kind of come apart I'm sure if I really worked on it to come off but I wouldn't spend more than 50 bucks on the shoe especially for the fact that the leather that it does have is the absolute worst Nike leather we've ever seen so let me know what you guys think and what your experience has been in these if you own a pair of these and if there's anything you disagree with let me know below and

KS2XBoseItg,Adidas Superstar,we good yeah we good in this video I'm going to review the Adidas Superstar let's take a look let's discuss it I'm going to give you my personal experiences I've been wearing these shoes for 2 and 1/2 months they're super battered up not worth skating anymore falling apart I'll review them and I'll break down my opinions of these first time experience wearing these shoes down to the bare baress also I'm going to be SK UBC Park the entire video so watch out for those clips I'm going to break these shoes down and skate so I have three categories in this video first look features and performance I never thought I would ride Superstars until I saw an ad on Facebook Marketplace for $20 and these ones were 40 so I couldn't pass it up and I like the style the aesthetic is really good so it boosts my effort in skating just by looking down on my shoes and enjoying what I see let's get into the first look the first things you notice though is a lot of stitching on literally the outer and the inner there's a lot of stitching you got to worry about the laces have stitching so you got to take care of that or else you're going to have some issues rather quickly the one thing that's odd is it goes from low gum sole to hot and I'm going to talk about that later why it's advantageous they're rather lightweight for what looks like a rather large shoe and Tall gumsole they look bulky but when you wear them in they they don't feel so [Applause] [Applause] moving on to the features of of this shoe I'm going to repeat myself a couple times the stitching lots of stitching so much stitching you got to take care of it um you got the laces they come pretty low you got the full leather body even the stripes are leather and then you've got a rubber toe cap which is the staple of this shoe it's what stands out for a lot of people when they get this shoe you got the reinforced gum sole right here which provides some protection interior around the ankle and the tongue not bulky just perfect like literally a nice lean padding nothing crazy so yeah it's all leather which helps prevent promote longevity also it has an insole doesn't do much but the gum sole is what compensates for that you really don't need this in my opinion it still has more padding than a Vans shoe even if you have Ultra Kush in my opinion like I've jumped down I've jumped downstairs with these and it's all good that's just a brief feature overview lastly I'm going to talk about the performance of this shoe give you my personal experience and why I now favor these shoes and I bought a second pair also I just get good deals on Marketplace for this shoe so [Applause] he [Applause] first thing from performance is they're slow to break in from my personal experience it takes time but because I like the Aesthetics of this shoe I gave it enough attention and time and patience to get over that hump of Breakin because these shoes are so stiff when you first skate them like you just forget about doing anything well and just have fun skating and sucking for a bit for like a couple days few days a week maybe to really get the full benefit of this shoe once it's broken in you got to get over that hump that's one thing I had to learn basically it's worth a headache um number two the selling point for me was how I felt when I was jumping downstairs seven eight Street Park I was having fun and I wasn't getting heel bruises or feeling the pain of like coming down flat on your foot you know when you just like jam your foot into the ground that's the worst and these minimize that drastically these I can really sesh a staircase and throw tricks down with more patience not hurting my foot as much uh so a negative there's stitching everywhere literally everywhere I don't know if there's a shoe with more stitching they definitely is but anyways generally coming from all suede Vans I have no issues with ripping too much it's just the the leather that gets a hole in it but this you got to stay vigilant with the stitching if you want toe preserve the look of the shoe you got to stitch all the seams but also just in genuine just in skateboarding in general it's good to practice gluing your stitching in any shoe just to have that bit of longevity so it doesn't rip in silly places the second negative would be the laces come really low so they're constantly ripping if you have weak laces you'll always tear them um the stitching to comes up if you don't glue it around the low areas of where the laces are that'll Fray and then just break and just start peeling back the lower parts gave me problems but nothing that stopped me from having a good session so it just looks kind of silly you know or pretty dope honestly because you're just walking around with shoes that look like they're ready to go in the garbage all in all that's my review for the superstars I gave this one a chance cuz I like the look of it and I was rewarded I've never I I never knew these things about this shoe so I'm sharing it with you hopefully maybe you can benefit thanks for watching of course I'm stoked Greatful you guys are tuning in and just run up just go pro boxer Mike Tyson on that like button you know thanks for watching hope you enjoyed the skating at EC bye,2025-06-23 14:43:39.118855 UTC
LEgh_iHg7hQ,Nike Cortez,"we're going to talk about the movie and the rich history this sneaker holds we're going to have a detailed review and a look at this latest release we're going to talk about sizing if they're comfortable also we're going to talk about the name the Nike Cortez how it stems from this Petty beef that happened a long time ago between Adidas and Nike stick around until the end if you want to find out what that is let's not waste time thank you Jen thank you hi Forest I know you just got back from Vietnam and you love me but I'm going to go run a train with this group of black panthers I just met okay Jen today we're taking a closer look at an iconic sneaker from one of my favorite movies of all time M always said there's an awful lot you can tell about a person by those shoes of course we're talking about Forest Gump and the Nike Cortez that Tom Hanks was gifted by his then hor of a girlfriend hi Forest now that I have the most contagious and incurable disease known to mankind I'll finally have pity sex with you okay Jen and I'll mow the grass and raise the AIDS baby I hated Jenny I I really freaking hated Jenny in the summer of ' 94 Forest gum premiered worldwide and quickly became a classic many fans including myself consider this to be one of the greatest movies of all time one of the most memorable moments is when Forest gum played by Tom Hanks gets a pair of the legendary Nike Cortez he later goes on to run 50,000 miles in these which is the best marketing ever for a sneaker earning this colorway to be dubbed the forest gumps the Batman Jordan 6 worn by Michael Kon and of course the Nike Air Mags and Back to the Future Part Two are iconic movie sneakers and the Cortez Forest Gump ranks right up there with them and to celebrate his 35th birthday happy birthday of course they're finally making a comeback the forest gum features an allwhite leather construction with versity red accents on the switches and heel badge just like the original additional Nike branding appears on the tongue tag and the lacing system includes a shiny stainless steel lace lock the mids sole is made from foam with versity blue veg insert for extra comfort and bounce the classic Herring bone outsole pattern not only looks cool but also provides better grip and traction also a brief little history lesson on how the Nike Cortez the actual name where it came from before Nike there was Blue Ribbon sports that was the name of the company and they were actually us Distributors for onitsuka Tiger this was when Nike wasn't manufacturing sneakers they just ordered them and sold them in US Bill Bowman founded Blue Ribbon Sports Nike together with Phil Knight and onuka tiger had a completely different name for the shoe that wasn't catchy at all so they were thinking about rebranding this iconic sneaker and the Olympic Games was right around the corner and they wanted to rename this shoot the Aztec because the Olympic Games were held in Mexico and it wanted to pay homage but Adidas put a stop to that because they had a sneaker that was very popular at the time this was in 1968 by the way when the Olympic Games were held in Mexico but Adidas put a stop to that they even threatened Nike with a lawsuit because they had their own sneaker ASC gold AA gold and this pissed Phil and Bowerman off and in Phil Knight's Memoirs he even wrote about this moment and I just want to read to you aggravated I drove up to the mountain to Bowman's house to talk it all over we sat on a wide porch looking down at the river it sparkled that day like a silver shoelace weird little thing to say but okay oh okay Janet he took off his ball cap put it on again rubbed his face who was that guy who kicked the out of the Aztec he asked Cortez I said okay let's call it the Cortez and of course he's referring to heran Cortez the Spanish conqueror who defeated the Aztec and that's how the name Nike Cortez was created crazy story that a petty beef so long ago between Adidas and Nike is the reason for this name change and that it's actually shots fired at Adidas I just find it fascinating love it and now I'm going to talk about something entirely different that I think I I just want to put it in this video and I want to tell you how much this sneaker means to me because of the movie for his gum for those who don't know I am a huge movie buff I love movies I love games I had a tough upbringing and movies and games were like this way of escaping reality and Forest gum was very important to me because it was a movie that I used to throw on when life was hard I used to throw on Forest Gump and it just made everything better so the movie means a lot to me Tom hack is one of my favorite actors it's it's just a really epic story and one of the biggest moments in the movie is of course when Jenny that gifts Forest the legendary Nike Cortez and uh he runs forever in the these released on May 8th on the sneakers app for retail price of $110 and by the way I'm shocked cuz I just looked up the prices on the aftermarket I completely forgot to do that before I started recording and they're already above $500 I W through the raffle and I just figured they were easy to win but apparently not I guess they were kind of limited since the price has skyrocketed now I'm even happier so yeah they do fit true the size everybody told me that but I went a full size up I don't know why recently I started doing that with a lot of sneakers I guess I just like the extra room for my toes and yeah not much else to talk about the box is nothing special looks like this regular Nike shoe box no extra shoelaces no nothing but guess what I don't need it I'm still happy and by the way if you want to see me review an extremely limited Nike SP dunk Clow then click on this link right here you won't be disappointed thanks",2025-06-23 11:22:08.122498 UTC

66kylxnfGZs,Adidas Gazelle,welcome back everyone to another episode of Shay TV my name is Marissa Hill and today we're going to be taking a look at a silhouette we have yet to do on the channel and these are called the gazelle bold and this is in the pink and green colorway let's take a quick sneat welcome back everyone to another unboxing and review if you're joining us for the first time welcome in be sure to hit that subscribe down below if you're not already subscribed to the channel and give this video a thumbs up if you enjoy these unboxing and fashion styling segments today we're going to be covering a brand new silhouette on the channel that I'm really excited for if you haven't already checked out my article on what I think are going to be the latest fashion trends for the year 2024 definitely go check that article out on shad studios.com I talk about how platform sneakers are going to be a huge Trend this year and of course what better than to talk about the gazelle bolt so we'll go through the overview of this jump into size and fit followed by how I saw this really fun pop of color then we'll conclude with where you can find these as well as how much they're going for on the retail side of things so let's jump right into it I've definitely been seeing a tick in what people are wearing here in New York and seeing this crazy transition into a definite High platform silhouette so if you're somebody who's looking to add some additional height but you also want to be quite fashionable I feel like the gazelle is the perfect sneaker to start with definitely going to get a couple extra inches from this thick triple mle that you'll see on the bottom of this gazelle and if you're somebody who loves the gazelle silhouette and again you're looking for that additional height this is also a great package in its own to go with the gazelle bold as far as the color schemes go I really am enjoying the gazelle bolds and these really fun color combinations they do have more of a black and white tone but I do feel like these vibrant colors are so fun so as far as the color scheme of this it's this nice pop of pink and I decided to do a color combination with this Pine Green which I think really compliments the pink perfectly we've got pink laces and a really cool textured tongue in white and then we've got Pops of green for the Adidas branding let's take a look at those details then jump into the side paneling all right so as far as the medial and lateral size of sneaker same exact color blocking in the nice suede texture in that pink and then we've got three stripes in smooth leather in that green tone which will also see on the back of the heel the only difference on the lateral side is you are getting the gazelle uh print in white which pops perfectly off of the pink and then the interior for the insole is in pink and green as well the Seeker is then completed with this beautiful midle in a two-tone gum bottom so we've got two layers of the gum bottom in a lighter shade and then it gets a little bit darker on the third layer here and then the gum bottom is completed on the bottom of the out soole as well all right so let's take a look at those details then jump into size and fit as far as size and fit goes these definitely run on the larger side of uh the scale so I actually went half a size down so I'm typically a s and 1 half or a nine in women's so I decided to go with an 8 and 1/2 in women's or seven and men's and these fit me perfectly so definitely size down on this one if you're trying to figure out what is the best size range cuz these do run quite large all right so now let's jump into styling again what a fun popup color to style especially as we're getting into spring I feel like this is definitely a color combination you might want to try out for the first look I decided to wear this really cool multicolored Adidas zip up jacket which has some nice colors that match the sneaker perfectly and then I layered that on top of a denim tank with a matching denim maxi skirt find a way to bring you to say the I need to you feel me feel then for the second look I decided to wear a denim ruffle dress that was a mini dress and I feel like denim just really pops and compliments the sneaker perfectly my can let come I you then for the last and final look I wore a cropped cream sweater with some nice basic light denim pants my head in R statement of confusion is just for you cuz I know that I want I [Applause] I don't up up all right so as far as the retail goes these retail at $120 you can pretty much finding anywhere any Adidas retail stores online or in store I picked up a pair of these in Foot Locker but these are actually in Champs they're also at Snipes they're at JD Sports they're on different uh options like ASO so you can definitely find these pretty much everywhere in different color combinations but again I feel like this is just such a great silhouette for at an additional height a great price point but also just a nice fun two-tone looking shoe all right everyone that is it for this unboxing and review if you join this for the first time thank you so much hit that

Qn5PsauO9-A,Reebok Club C 85 Vintage shoes,welcome back everyone to another episode of sh TV my name is morissa Hill and today we're going to be taking a look at a rebok club c85 vintage let's take a quick seat feat welcome back everyone to another unboxing and review if you're joining us for the first time welcome in be sure to hit that subscribe down below and give this video a thumbs up if you enjoy these unboxing and styling segments today we're going to be discussing the rebok club c85 vintage which is pretty much one of the most popular sinkers I've been seeing on foot here in New York currently so we'll go through the overview of these jump into size and fit and then we'll talk about how I style this really vintage looking sneaker then we'll conclude with how much these are priced on the retail Market so let's jump right into it if you are looking to just start your sneer collection you don't know where to start what brand to go with I feel like right now price point wise look and feel this is a great starter sneaker that you can really just pair and wear with anything and everything and what's crazy is the sneaker was created back in 1985 and it is still a hot and trendy looking shoe uh so as far as the color scheme goes on this it is all aged in the color and tones throughout so we've just got this off-white finish and the leather is premium and tumbled and soft and nice and Squishy which I really love about uh as far as the material goes for the upper of this it really feels good on the toes one of the things that does frustrate me a bit though with the reok club SE 85s is I just wish there was a little more width on the toe box cuz I feel like my pinky toes tend to rub for some reason on these and it doesn't get broken in to the point where that rubbing doesn't make my foot feel uncomfortable but other than that I do love how malleable and soft this leather is on the toe as far as laces go we've got some off-white laces a peachy tone for the mesh tongue which is outlined in cream and then we've got re box branding in green and red let's take a look at those details then move along to the side paneling all right so wrapping around to the side paneling we've got that same just lovely textured leather in that off-white tone and then we've got Reebok in green on the back and then the same color combination on the lateral side except we have the Reebok branding in green as well the interior has rebok in it and then it's fully covered in this beautiful just nice terry cloth Chenille uh finish which is very soft feels nice and gentle like a towel and then Reebok has kind of had that worn look as you can see on the insole but the insole also is that same texture as you see on the collar so super soft inside and then when we work our way down to the midsole it is in this nice beige finish which gives it this kind of worn effect which I really love I think it brings the sneaker together and then you've got the rebok there which blends monochromatically quite nicely and then the out soole is in that same exact color way all right let's take a look at those last and final details [Applause] he as far as size and fit goes I stuck true size and these do fit me perfectly although again I do have that subtle issue which just the toe box being a bit on the narrow side I do have narrow feet so if you actually have flatter wider feet I would actually recommend sizing up to just give you a little bit of extra space in the toe box region all right so now let's talk about styling this again this is just such a great vintage looking sneaker this is going to go with pretty much everything and anything and would be a great beater shoe just because it already kind of has this worn look I literally was in the mall when I picked these up and I feel like so many people were trying these on and buying them so I kid you not this is hands down one of the most sought after Seekers right now that I feel like a lot of people are buying uh as far as styling goes I decided to just keep it simple for the first look with a white tank and a denim mini skirt then for the second look I went with a nice simple yellow T-shirt with some great biker shorts for a more casual at leisure look and then for the last and final look dressed up a little bit with a vest that had a nice light brown tone and it was outlined in black with a matching maxi skirt so this is a great sneaker that you can definitely dress up you can dress down uh this is definitely just going to be a great allaround lifestyle sneaker God please protect me I'm halfway home take the wheel right now I Let Go thinking about the ones I let go I thought by now you forgive me no it's not easy forgiving founding new reason for living n says making noise all all the the hand I was got to let it shuh huh tell me where the sign I'll give it all away for some pce of mind cuz life f is all as far as price point goes you can't beat it this is retailed at $90 which is probably a huge reason that a lot of people are going after these just because not only is the quality really nice it's also easy to sell sneaker but the price point is under $100 all right everyone

FEWtuMI_tFI,Stan Smith,"welcome back to Cape Critiquers everybody Today we are talking about the trial of the Incredible Hulk from 1989 Bill Bixby Lou Farerigno Yep Right off the bat I noticed that they just kept calling him [ __ ] David Belair the whole time because he see the whole premise of the show was that he just walked from town to town city to city and always had a madeup name because he was a man on the lamb cuz he was really accused of a murder Mhm as I remember in the beginnings of the uh thing So he assumed his own death and off he went So even on his tombstone though it's David Bruce Banner David Bruce Banner Yeah that's that was just a little bit I searched it up The the studio thought that he would sound too gay if his name was Bruce Banner That's what you're talking the 80s Yeah Not like maybe a little earlier right when when did the show The show was in the 80s 78 to 82 Yeah it was late Yeah late 70s 78 Yeah So like I don't know just different time I watched this show religiously I actually loved this show as a I mean if it's anything like this movie it's pretty decent show especially for the time And they would never admit that Yeah They only admitted that recently because comic book fans of course were saying but we always thought it was Bruce B Where did David come from and that was kind of the they gave whatever [ __ ] excuse It's just so Yeah I know It is what it is But it's just like okay but I grew up with that David Bruce Banner being you know I mean I knew Bruce from the comics from the TV show I mean I grew up like sort of with this with Bill Bixby was Does he ever like call himself Bruce at all or is it like only on the show never No never No He was always a mildmannered guy intelligent He was always the kind of actor that you you wished was your next door neighbor you know always had that very pleasant pleasantness about him And uh and then Lou Ferraro came along and actually was found the perfect acting role for him Ligno is [ __ ] huge He's I I don't know if he's 6'4 or 6'6 but the difference between him and Schwarzenegger Schwarzenegger was the bodybuilder so Schwarzenegger had all the cuts and and big man too but Fignno was a powerlifter Yeah So he was there to lift the five 600 lb And of course like you said he just looked like a big brick wall It's just in like actually insane to look that way Yeah But it's just so funny cuz after this and you know years later comes a uh a comedy show a sitcom comes and Lou Fargno plays a neighbor on uh Yeah No Yeah You want to hold Look looking back on this though the it's just so 70s 80s 90s style television It's just absolutely you know it's just amazing Honestly like for the most part I found it all pretty straightforwards and like easy to watch and like there's times when like it's like oh this is like actually pretty good And then I was saying to Jack there's times where it's like unintentionally like the funniest [ __ ] thing I've ever seen Just like the whole there's like a dream sequence in this where he's just tearing up this [ __ ] courtroom Well the name of the show is the trial of the Hulk but how are you going to put the Hulk on trial for real it had to be a dream sequence but they advertised this whole thing of him turning into the Hulk I remember this being advertised I didn't watch this show when it came out but I remember it cuz I was a big fan of the original show but then ' 89 I sort of aged out of that I guess that type of TV And um I I just I mean watch this just put me right back to the Incredible Hulk television show I watched the series and like you said you're talking 78 to 82 So I was 16 17 years old Again it's it's corny in its own way and they're limited to what special effects they could use Most of the practical stuff Yeah I thought like Hulk [ __ ] like throwing people around Great Yeah that that was marvelous A lot of the stuff that he breaks you could see almost that it's it's not real woody Yeah you can see But hey it worked for me back then I honestly thought it looked good even like when he busts out of the jail like that whole those uh well the way they did that that sequence when you heard the sound and then they show the broken wall and or the twisted bars or what have you I thought they did that pretty well in there For me it was interesting cuz at first you know the first time I saw him Hulk out I was like oh this is hilarious like what the [ __ ] is this um cuz I'm so used to the great what our Hulk our generational Hulk But then I I started thinking well what if I was a kid back in the 80s and I was seeing this i started thinking about it a little bit more and holy [ __ ] it was actually awesome It was awesome I mean they I even say they nailed like getting the shots of like the shirt ripping and the shoes expanding and the eyes turning was cool I think this is like Eric Bayana like said this is like a major reason he wanted to play Hulk So yeah I mean I thought he did a good job as the Hulk That was just an oddly directed version of that I don't remember anything from that other than [ __ ] wolves that get progressively bigger Hulk wolves by um the Asian director Yeah The guy who did Brokeback Mountain Yeah Yeah I I really like the transition from like in the dream sequence when it turns to Matt like [ __ ] hammering you must do this or whatever Just answer the question Yeah Just the like lawyer or whatever in court I don't know Just an interesting cut there Mhm Another one You said it but uh it's another one just shot really well Yeah Where like I I just was not focusing on the story at all You know I I have like four [ __ ] notes here I mean the the story probably isn't too far off of like a 70s to 80s Daredevil And this is like a twoshot comic probably Um but I sent you one where it's just Kingpin like sitting like that and he has his [ __ ] mirror glasses and you can just see the reflection of the screens I wonder why they went with the dwarf kingpin I Well I didn't even really notice that I I was just more so interested that he was like a man in the chair Yeah Mhm Well you're saying the actor to play him Yeah Well he's not like a dwarf in real life No no no But I just had a cl Why they didn't go with the the the big kingpin You guys know him better from that I know him as Sal from Indie Indiana Jones Oh yeah I mean I I thought he was actually pretty good in this He's like definitely he was actually pretty good in it His motiv his motivation is kind of funny when you just think that he's like if I [ __ ] show people I've beat up Daredevil they'll give me a big company but he actually played like a true like eccentric kingpin I thought he did pretty well Yeah he was definitely like the cool king I don't know Like he was just the guy in the chair for me the guy felt like he literally was in the chair telling the guys exactly what to do Like kind of like not a bad kingpin though Yeah I don't It's interesting to do that But I don't know It's weird Like he's looking at the screen He's like ah how nice Like what are you going to do for the rest of your life 24 hours Also the [ __ ] one part [ __ ] like so funny The one part where he's like I want a big screen right here So he he got the essence of the kingpin Yeah Yeah without the physical attributes of the comic book kingdom He is kind of big Yeah I didn't honestly notice that Yeah the hair slick back 80s style Like something about the beard really threw me off about Kingdom and it's like the Oakley glasses Yeah the glasses are weird but like they were big back but they were big back that was like cool glasses back then you know so you have to remember it sort of did age you know It's funny when we do this We remember it first runner We live through it Exactly This is like kind of pre uh I I do think the glass is like made for cool looking shots but it's just like funny to think about you know you have to remember like going back to the TV show itself towards the end of it like the Hulk had interactions I think with Sasquatch Was it him or was it the $6 million man the $6 million man did like they did some weird things on this show and he interacted with Thor I know that Yeah that's right Thor he had an interaction with Thor on this show The comic where Hulk meets Wolverine Isn't that Sas Saskatch or Yeti or something the Wendo Is it the Windo yeah I think It's right up there But like it's not [ __ ] Native American lore accurate Windendo at all Just like that monster Yeah it just is a Sasquatch pretty much Sasquatch Sasquatch He's No he's he's he's pretty supernatural Well I'm just saying like it doesn't look like a windo at all but doesn't [ __ ] have horns or anything [ __ ] furry monster Yeah Well that he's like also like a relatively big Wolverine villain now Yeah One of like honestly there's like a female Wendo or like Wendigo researcher that he's like a love interest and then like she becomes the Wendo in front of him and she Yeah I kind of like vaguely know what you're talking anyway I thought the Daredevil action was pretty good Yeah I did too And like actually kind of good way of showing his powers I thought a little bit overdone but like in theory interesting I guess Kind of cool cuz like I mean like how else do you show sonar in the [ __ ] ' 90s or '8s even yeah Even just the idea of actual [ __ ] loring him into this place and then just like blaring this [ __ ] sound into his ears But they didn't know that he was blind They didn't know anything about Yeah that was weird I mean like weird I guess he is always like ""Oh that's [ __ ] too that gun's too loud to me or that knife."" So like it's not It can't be the least obvious thing You're I don't like the sound of your knife [ __ ] just yelling at Turk Yeah I thought it was funny that they had Turk in it and he's not black Yeah cuz he is in the comics I It just probably is one of those things where it's like this is a character we don't even give a [ __ ] about Doesn't matter what we did make him Turkish No that he really wasn't notable in any way He look more Irish I don't know [ __ ] the scene where Kingpin like has the glasses full of diamonds instead of champagne and there's just like [ __ ] you can just see like for like 10 seconds just a guy like pouring the diamond pocket I was thinking like that's going to [ __ ] fall out and go everywhere It's a [ __ ] like I guess this is what I'm doing during the scene Yeah cuz nobody else did it Just Yeah he just kept [ __ ] like pouring him in [ __ ] Fisk escaping on a fantastic car Oh my god That was like the [ __ ] last thing I expected to happen And it just took off so slowly and then like the Daredevil's like right in front of it and he's just like you're going to pay like is this like the last thing in the Incredible Hulk show universe cuz like it just probably then just [ __ ] fisk escaping They should have made a Daredevil show I like feel like that would have done well back then Yeah probably I mean like most probably would When was the Captain America movie that we watched uh 90 Yeah So this is a year after This isn't that isn't the first Captain America movie by the way Yeah There was like an 80s TV movie cuz they were trying to do the same thing Two of them actually I don't feel good Could you pull over twice yeah I still can't believe that the fact that that came out a year after this and like this is just so much better Yeah H I mean like it look I I'll rewatch Captain America before this really for sure It just [ __ ] like I I'll get more laughter out of it [ __ ] I don't there is like funny sequences in this just like insane [ __ ] [ __ ] that happens Nothing will beat Captain America's transformation sequence when it's 90 shots in 2 seconds I was kind of I was kind of getting like that during the part when he like first transforms into the Hulk on the train and just like this woman [ __ ] punches like the guy's arm and then she he just shoots a [ __ ] random old person out of the train and then like the doors blow off because he punches the guy halfway across the [ __ ] subway It's insane I I did like the camp elements of this I guess but also just like you just got this [ __ ] guy like who was about to rape that woman I guess just [ __ ] like why would Kingpin ever hire him type thing that that guy and then like he was just like still a part of the team and then like went to do it again and then just like [ __ ] Germa that was there that just like sometimes I do good Yeah he goes to like hit uh [ __ ] the Hulk but not like the David not Bruce Banner over the head with a pot and just bashes the guy and I don't even [ __ ] know what that whole thing was about Yeah the redemption arc from the assistant was weird And then he just went with him in the end anyway Yeah they don't Did he Yeah he was flying the the car I almost like What they don't tell you is that he crashed in on purpose First time we saw the assistant guy it was almost like [ __ ] implied that they were like gay lovers cuz like hey yeah go into the bedroom or whatever He was like ""Are you sleeping 7 hours a night?"" Yeah I don't know It It was weird Like something about sleep [ __ ] go to bed or whatever I don't know I think he wanted him to to rest that he would be well rested It's just funny that they all live in the same building I guess Yeah And then like something weird at the end when they're like ""Yeah the building's shorter."" It's like ""Yeah the the voltage box."" No I don't know The thing that the car was in Yeah but it was like a fake voltage box No it was a big part It looked like a part of a building but like high voltage Yeah it was it almost looked like electrical [ __ ] was going on in there I don't know That was weird to me too That you would even like really hotel used to have the greatest view in the city than a Yeah skyscraper [ __ ] rundown hotel that he's still paying for Slept in it once maybe Not even Didn't even sleep there honestly Yeah you might be right Used to have the greatest view in the city The one thing that I always wondered about him though is like this this is a guy who has a small bag on his back no money except for what he's making I think and he's tearing out of his clothes every at least twice in an episode Where's he getting all these new clothes these brand new sneakers and everything else i'm still lost at the beginning why that random guy threw him into the mud He was just picking on him Yeah I didn't get that scene either Kept like throwing him down He's going to bash him with a shovel and then come on come on And then walked away That was that And that was enough for him to be like I'm not staying here I'm going to the the city Yeah Weird I don't know why he would go to the city cuz that's like dangerous He was like ""I can't [ __ ] be near people."" Yeah Yeah That's even worse So let's go to a place where they're compacted into a small concrete area and where people can be [ __ ] to you constantly Yeah And get me angry Does he ever wouldn't like me when I'm angry in the show does he ever like go to like just the wilderness to live like has he ever tried that cuz I'm pretty sure that's like a thing in the comics Not that I remember No No Not that I remember I think that's when he meets the Wendigo is like he's in Alaska or some [ __ ] Maybe not Alaska Canada Yeah Wolverine Yeah of course You know at the end of this they almost made it like a cliffhanger like he was going to come back cuz now I I'm my doctor I still have it You have a brother I have a brother Brother now But and then it just I guess it didn't have such great ratings and uh going to come up with a actually interesting that they made the connection between like Matt's like radiation accident even though like I think that's a redcon in the comics but still I actually didn't like that that he got the same he got his powers from Bruce Banner's toxic waste Well I don't think it was the same toxic waste [ __ ] when he like checks out his eyes and he's just like immediately no you're blind forever I thought that was funny He's not coming back So why be able to see you no No 5 seconds Like I'm a doctor Just like Okay Also like I don't think he's not like a medical doctor No he's like a [ __ ] Yeah He has like a doctorate in [ __ ] nuclear physics and nine other things [ __ ] gamma radiation Yeah Blind forever Hulk his beard goes away I don't know I I didn't I did not put down a favorite least favorite Yeah I I think you got to especially when the series was running late 70s early 80s most of the stuff people were watching on TV had very little to do with making sure there was quality story Yeah It was what can we put on the screen to keep people's attention And and it worked 90% of the time just to keep people interested Story-wise like you could always look back and go ""Oh [ __ ] horrible story."" But back then entertainment was entertainment I honestly feel like it was kind of just like fine right like this one Maybe not I haven't seen every episode of the show Yeah And you're going to find stinkers on everything There's probably one where it's like he's got to fight like a [ __ ] gargoyle man or something There's just problems everywhere he goes He just never has a good day But like even like you said like the idea of just being like the trial of the Incredible Hulk back then [ __ ] watch it Right Exactly Nothing to do on whatever Friday night or whenever they showed it Exactly Um TV was interesting Yeah And like I said you had Bill Bixby who was like a fan favorite Always had that that essence about him you know And Fargno big man Oh yeah big man Let's see what he can destroy this week Yeah An actual giant human And then I thought um I think it's Rex Smith Great as like Matt Murdoch Daredevil Weird that like they wouldn't just name the like assistants [ __ ] Foggy and Karen Yeah No I have no idea if like they're supposed to be anybody because they were like pretty hyper specific about the the guy being like a former like like a war veteran Yeah I don't know I also had a question When Matt Murdoch gets out of his apartment and he's walking to the cab how do they did they do this i don't know if they do this in like real life I understand like the cab driver helped them Yeah Like grabbed them and then just basically walked them to the Well it almost seemed like they had a some type of agree like an arrangement or something where he picked them up every day So maybe that was part of the Sometimes they still do that Yeah Nowadays when uh like my disabled people call for accessoride or something Yeah Yeah Yeah They'll pull up get out and make sure they Nowadays most of them are rotten rotting up If you can't get in [ __ ] you Pay me anyway Also did you guys catch the Stan Lee cameo i did See it was in the courtroom That was cold God he was young Yeah he looked good I don't know I watched this at four times speed You missed the jury Um Oh just like the Speaking of the jury like this guy just [ __ ] watched uh the courtroom officer get launched across the room and then takes it upon himself to just [ __ ] launch a chair at the whole and missed completely Totally missed And then just like ran away like what the [ __ ] are we doing funny like oh my god But how many times have Lofig know that's like 90% of the paycheck But the thing is like this is all just a dream Like he's putting into his own dream That's a good point [ __ ] getting like sprayed Yeah Pepper sprayed I Yeah like this I it it wasn't bad It wasn't a bad watch at all I enjoyed it And like I said I probably watched a semi bad Daredevil show with this guy Do we do we have a favorites and least favorite scenes i don't know Not really My favorite's probably the courtroom or honestly like the jewelry heist I thought was really well sequenced That was well Yes that was interesting And that's when you got the first thing of the man in the chair you know They actually did that pretty well though you I mean it's just also just interesting like the tech they used just [ __ ] like speaker phones I don't know [ __ ] better heist than we got in Born Again Um least favorite scene is definitely that car taking off at the end It was just going so slow I wanted to push it Yeah I think I was just too like bewildered to even just driving through the the city What about when like Daredevil's like talking about his relationship with the sheriff or whatever and it's just like such a funny scene in a meeting and he's just like I don't know It's weird Yeah I like I was I watched that and I was like ""Okay so that's how he remembered it going cuz you can't see."" Like oh boy Yeah Like he just knew in that moment He didn't [ __ ] think he was getting mugged He knew that he called out a man to become the Daredevil So forget it I mean what it's going to be one of the 15 also insane [ __ ] thing for a sheriff to say Mhm Yeah Yeah That was [ __ ] inciting Just like a a vigilante essentially But like even when I don't I guess think about that part of it too much The underground corruption elements of this were actually like pretty interesting and done well Like Kingpin has the doctors He's got just everybody kind of in the palm of his hand The doctor coming in with the uh needle the whole thing And then he comes out of just behind the curtain in the room That's another moment for me that was close to Cap where it [ __ ] pushes this woman into something and just blows up the like whoa And when she's just trying to insert an air bubble I guess there was nothing I thought she was going to put something in her neck There was nothing in the syringe I think it was just supposed to be an air bubble that will kill you Yeah She tried to kill me and he saved me Daredevil Yeah This lady the other doctor or whatever it was Yeah kicked across the [ __ ] room too Um his suit looked good Daredevil suit It was It's the black suit Ly I don't think it's like ever used in the comics I mean it's the black suit Like not I don't think it's a homemade black suit I mean like I think that's really only a thing from the shows Black yellow and red but it's like the one from the Daredevil the Netflix show and like he has the thing tied around his head Yeah Yeah We have them right here You can open them up Oh look what one he's wearing Well anyways moving on I don't know It's almost just kind of like a weird Black Panther suit to me Yeah I thought he just went to a party city just bought one of those like fully colors Yeah And just got a like one of those night cap things that you put on a black version Just did that and that's it It's pretty much what it is Exactly what they did Yeah I don't know I thought it looked cool It worked It worked We have to stay within budget Yeah Uh what are we going to rate this one i don't know It's four three Really i don't know Yeah For what it is I'll give it a five I mean like the cinematography was fine but honestly going with like a six I was even maybe thinking like six and a half but I'm pretty content with a six Also like I feel like most of why I like the cinematography is just cuz like it's a thinner aspect ratio so like you got to fit more on screen I guess Just makes it you got to think about it Yeah I don't know I I felt like for the most part it was well sequenced and pretty straightforward as far as what it was trying to do I mean obviously there's some like corny and just silly elements but we're also talking about a man that turns into a big green [ __ ] monster So and 36 years ago Yeah Right So I thought it was pretty good Six Seven I'll give it a seven Okay Nice Enjoyed it I'm in the five area myself but that's okay Yeah You know but it was it was television back then you know i think like Jack said you're going to get more entertainment on a rewatch out of like a cap 1990 But as far as like really trying to make something I feel like this one is closer to being an actual movie That was our review of The Trial of the Incredible Hulk Next week on Cape Critiquers we have Superman and the Molemen from 1951 Nice That's before my time You believe a man can fly maybe And also happy birthday AJ Yay Let's do the birthday Do the birthday Happy birthday Mr AJ And

tried to [ __ ] stab him and then try again That was a cool That was another cool like scene him and then like the the sergeant guy took him in there and then left before he made sure he got back to

we've come out to Seville for the marathon weekend so it's currently Friday at about 5:00 so we've been traveling here today this is our apartment uh quite nice little place in the center of Seville um so yeah going to take the shoes out for a bit of a spin Ellie's going to come with me for the first 5k and then jump on a bike or something like that she's also going to be running in a pair of on shoes these are the cloud um Eclipse also great shoe and I think I brought her was it for Christmas yeah for Christmas so yeah she's also in on more max cushioned but I'll be running in the new Cloud monster which has also added a bit more stack kite so it's even more cushion than the previous version so I'm basically just going to talk you through some First Impressions what's changed and yeah is it worth upgrading from the one to the two but anyway just going to get changed into some kit kit gear kit let me quickly show you around the place this is the kitchen little kitchen nice bathroom and that's the bedroom nice little place um but yeah going to get changed in some kit and head out for a first run in the new Cloud monster TOS nice and easy I'm getting tow off already for going too quick So the plan is Ellie is going to run what reckon 5K 5K see as she gets on then we're going to try and find some sort of rentable device either a bike or a scooter and then yeah I'll get to do a little bit longer run to properly test out the shoes but yeah the weather's beautiful it's about 20° yeah as I said the sun will be setting shortly so um yeah should be a nice little run no idea where we're going we're just going to explore sun's out not used to this my eyes eyes can't handle it we hav seen a sun in the UK for what it feels like at least a month anyway but yeah weather is beautiful so we're about 3 km into the Run weather here is lovely I think we've both been caught off guard a little bit about how warm it is saw a road sign that said 23° but um yeah the monsters are are really nice very familiar to what the original Monsters felt like which I think is a is a good thing they've not moved away too much from that first version um but I'm definitely feeling a few changes slightly higher stack kite only by about 5 or 6 mil can feel that in the for foot noticeably a little bit more sort of energ return more energy return in the front of the shoe maybe due to that dual density mid cell but um yeah very comfortable slightly improved lacing system um and a little bit more plush in the heel but only very minor changes if you like the oncloud monster one then you're going to love the two for me somebody who loved the first version I'm glad to see that the two isn't too far away from the original one Okay so we've finished the first 5k in about 6 minute kilm pace Ellie's just picked up a bike she's just testing it out and uh she's going to follow me for the next sort of 10:15 see how we get on maybe a bit longer it's quite nice weather over here so it's nice to make the most of it oh she's gone anyway where you going that way we're off apparently now I've got to keep up so we just finished the run about 15 km did you enjoy that yeah 5K and 10K on the bike yeah prefer the bike yeah but um we just got off the lime and guess how much it cost $1 1860 860 that's a hefty Bill whoopsie hope the shoes are worth it they were pretty good to be fair um we're going to get washed and dressed go up some dinner and then I'll talk to you through some first impressions of the new Cloud monster cheers when in Spain order a pizza so I'm back in the drizzly UK to share with you my first impressions of the cloud monster 2 I've now done about three or four runs in it um so I think plenty of time to be able to do a little bit of a comparison between the two and the first version as you can see in these two ways they look almost identical but I have found that there are nine changes um there maybe more maybe less that I've found between the two shoes so I'll quickly talk you through them and then let you know whether it's worth the upgrade from the original to the new version but the cloud monster as a shoe is just one of those that really works well for me um I'm not sure whether it's my foot strike or the way I run but it just offers a real nice amount of cushioning protection and if you want to pick up the pace you can do um I even did sessions in the original cloud monster um when I was wearing holiday and I could only bring one pair of shoes and it handles that well because it does have that nylon plate let's talk about a few of the changes so the first one is the groove in the bottom of the shoe has been filled in big upgrade to the original um you're no longer going to get those uh Stones annoyingly fitting into the bottom of the shoe that you have to stop and take out so that's a big plus Point um the Mido is now increased in stack height we've got a 6 mm increase so we now got 35 mil in the heel dropping to 29 under those toes for a 6 mil drop so yeah that is something that is noticeable when running feels slightly higher slightly more maximal um so it's going to offer a little bit more protection than the originals um I couldn't hugely tell the difference between them um but when I put the cloud monster one and the two on foot I could definitely feel that the two had a little bit more stack height we've now got a dual density midso so as you can see this orange bit and the white bit um we didn't have that in the previous version it was just one uh compound but now we got two different types um and it just makes the front of the shoe feel a little bit more bouncy um maybe slightly firmer under the toes it is a very minor change and again unless you've got both of the shoes on feet at the same time it's not one that you can hugely tell the difference the grip on this shoe has been improved ever so slightly um so in these black rubber areas here uh the grooves on them are slightly deeper and I did notice that that did offer for a little bit more traction another very minor change is the speedboard a slightly different blend according to on of the uh compound used in that so it's still a nylon plate but it's slightly different to the one used in the one it's not something I could tell the difference between if I'm totally honest but yeah that is one of the changes another change that you may be able to see between the two very minor again is the lacing system um so on this one we've got the sort of like uh fabric eyet change and we only had maybe six of them uh now we've got eight in the new Cloud monster and it uses these sort of like uh wire um grips to help improve the lockdown of the shoe I never had any issues with lockdown on the cloud monster one um so that differ uh to me hasn't really changed much um I still get a good lock down as I did in the previous version in the heel here we got slightly more um padding uh again a very minor change just to add a little bit more comfort in the shoe so with the increase in the stack heite slightly more plush in terms of cushioning that has seen a little bit of a weight increase I think it was only about 14 G in my uh UK size 7 and A2 um so very minor for me I guess if you have a slightly bigger foot then the weight change may be a little bit more significant but for me that isn't something that I could feel and to be honest with you I'd rather have a little bit more foam under my feet um so that sort of increase in weight was offset by the higher stack height and that increased protection so there's two more final changes and one of those is to the sustainability of this shoe shoe it's now made up of 92% recycled material on the upper um so yeah a good step forward from on they're always looking to be more sustainable and also we've seen a price increase when this shoe originally came out in March 2022 it was £150 and now the cloud monster 2 is retailing 170 which I think to be honest with you is the biggest downside to the shoe is just the price increase if you can pick this up at a discount which you can now at proir I think they've got them in a few sizes at 12 8 I think people are going to go for the cloud monster one um over the two just because of the price difference so there is nine changes to the cloud monster although you can hardly tell the difference if you look at the shoes and they do feel slightly more protective a little bit more responsive and yeah you get a little bit more cushioning and improved lockdown so yeah some good changes but they haven't drastically changed the cloud monster from the original one and that is reflected in the looks as well and to be honest with you that was a good thing for me because I absolutely loved this shoe um so I'm going to continue to enjoy logging the miles in this one it's definitely an improvement but I wouldn't say it's 100% necessary to go out and upgrade if your original for example is getting uh tired in terms if you put loads of miles in it you need to replace it then I would consider replacing it with the cloud monster 2 because of those minor improvements but if you want to pinch the pennies then maybe the original version um may be worth picking up out a discount so yeah that's pretty much my first impressions of the cloud monster 2 I absolutely love this shoe from on it's still my favorite from the brand you can do your recovery runs your easy runs and as I said you can pick up the pace if you need to um and expect a full review after 100 miles in this shoe so if you'd like to pick it up you can do so via proir it went live today I believe uh and I've left an affiliate link down below so if you'd like to check it out then please shop via that link just helps me out but until next time aspire to run run to inspire and we'll see you again soon,2025-06-23 14:41:03.326394 UTC
MTaGqiruSAE,Onitsuka Mexico 66,welcome back to the sneaker bench I'm reviewing a pair of shoes the old tigers six I'm Raj on the camera that is Spiro behind the camera today um first let's get some on feet sphere what do you have on today today I'm wearing my Bodega Club Seas I love these so much they are so comfy I've worn them all the time this is a huge sneaker for me whatever year of college that was for us um a junior here maybe I I don't a junior or senior year I wore them all the time and I have been trying to wear them less just because I don't want to kill them completely but I do love these and I am bringing them up today it's a great shoe this guy he wouldn't take him off for like a full year almost um I am wearing my GH bass penny loafers I love these things I got these in a size too big but I had to go get them adjusted I just love this shoe it's so much it's so easy to pair with black pants and yeah it's nothing crazy I think you can still get them on online for retail pretty easily I don't think that I don't think they sell out or anything like that it's cool penny loafer um yeah so let's get into it and he says the onitsuka tiger Mexico 66. it's in the middle there we go and the box is relatively plain this was just a gr colorway I got it for 120 dollars um don't forget they put the shipping label so yeah oh my gosh terrible uh I need to hold on to the right shoe and there's the left shoe there we go so this is the onitsuka tiger Mexico 66 in the uh cream and rust colorway it's the only colorway I think on their website right now that actually uses a cream base instead of a white base which is why I picked it up just because like I don't know I liked it way more I think it looks cool old I'm taking these to Africa too so it's like this is going to be my Africa all-day wear shoe um making or this is obviously sad making our way to the back of the shoe you have that tiger um branding you have that tiger branding right there and then you have the X um and suede on the back then making your way to the other side it's still that rust color suede on the toe um I think the leather is pretty good too I don't know I don't know what you think but the leather feel is pretty soft it's much softer than I expected it to be I expected to be kind of crappy but um just because I only got these for 120 dollars but it's pretty soft it's very comfortable um yeah in my opinion this shoe specifically is one of those shoes that's like it's very it's very like next to the trend of the Adidas Samba I know the samba is supposed to be like the shoe of the summer for 2023 or whatever but I think these are kind of a little bit more interesting than them just because they also have a really cool history um onitsuka is a brand that was only only sold in Japan and actually Phil Knight was the one that brought them to the US they didn't sell in the US at all and Phil Knight was he wasn't even a distributor at the time he was just like uh at the time that he started Distributing this shoe he was not a distributor but he like he faked his way into a meeting got actually I don't know if it was the shoe or the octopus shoe about one of them I think it was honestly good all right I don't know exactly which model it was but it yeah it was onasuka and then eventually he went on to Phil Knight went on to start Nike so it's very historical shoe uh New Mexico 66 also just it's been used in so many movies in so many interesting ways it's the Kill Bill shoe which is that normal yellow and black colorway that ever that you see a lot which personally it's just a little too loud for me I wanted something that was a little bit more wearable um so I didn't get that color away but that was in Kill Bill ando's and Bruce Lee's movie which I think that Kill Bill outfit was stolen from a little bit right not stolen from inspired by inspired by inspired by yeah yeah so I don't know I really like this show the it's just something that I think you could wear with almost anything um it's gonna be very comfortable to walk around in and stuff uh what do you think very cool um is taking him to or not Japan freaking Africa and the the inner is like it's pretty thin so you know I'm curious to know how much these will or how comfortable these may be for Everyday Use but um we will see Raj I'm sure will update us upon his return he's probably in Africa right now as we speak as you're watching this video but um yeah I mean it's got good leather raja's right it's come it looks like it would be comfy because it has nice materials not much support but sometimes she was like that surprise you um I think the colorway's cool and um yeah I think it'll be cool see what fitzroj throws in Africa with the elephants and the giant lions and whatnot we'll see what raja's wearing with these um I don't know if we got the outsole but it's nothing too crazy you've got the honestly guitar right there logo and then just this weird little triangle pattern nothing crazy at all the suede is nice on the back very nice um leather it's got a nice grain to it but um it's like I said it's not very thick so it's not going to feel plush or anything but you know that's not the feeling that leather gives you that's a lot of times a feeling that the padding on the inside gives you and as you can see there is not much padding but we will see it looks like a cool sneaker and I think it was a good pickup for Raj yeah it's just something I'm gonna wear a lot and um another thing is I I wasn't they didn't have my size originally in the shoe but I checked like they randomly got like one of size 10 I'd love to see that and it this size sign was sold out and then they randomly got one back which I guess was a return or something but that's the ones your whole you're saying right now anyways uh that's about it for us today I thank you anything else no nothing else hopefully you guys enjoyed the video and Roger hit him with the

caJUEsKcfqM,Adidas Superstar,welcome everybody to a new video thank you very much for joining me today we are going to be looking at this absolutely Beauty oh why this ABS this AB oh we going to start again or should I just leave it in should you just leave it in for ban let's just leave it in this AB abely beauty of a sneaker the Adidas Superstar the Adidas Superstar is what we're reviewing today it's a good looking sneaker a classic sneaker and it's been around since 1969 imagine still being able to get a hold of that sneaker that many years later made famous by Rundy MC it's a dope shoe super dope shoe um I have some sizing concerns so I will be letting you guys know about that we're going to be looking at the materials the sizing the fit comfort and then we're going to be giving the sneaker AR raying at the end a piece of history in my hand right now got to respect it man I know you guys love Nike and I know you guys really really enjoy uh Nike Max n don't worry I got you on that but at the moment I'm looking at picking up some classic sneakers also I got a review coming for the air more up tempos hopefully that should be around next week now the Adidas Superstar was one of the first ever Adidas basketball sneakers as well not lot of people know that I can't quite get the date for that so I'm not going to try and guess that the Adidas Superstar was one of the very first basketball sneakers worn by NBA players very very cool very cool this just speaks hip hop to me this is the rund the MC era and it carried over into the 90s with them as well they're such a dope shoe man I remember wearing these two School beating them up getting really Sor Fe they're not a comfortable sneaker but they're a dope shoe if you enjoy my content please hit like subscribe turn notifications let's just jump into it first we're going to start with a box that is absolutely wrecked by the person who delivered it then we're going to jump into the materials and I'm going to rate the sneaker at the end the sneakers come in this regular Adidas box I believe it's regular but I don't know because I don't wear that much Adidas so this might be like a hype box that's the way I got it delivered from every um yeah I I've did a little video on my Tik Tok about that you don't get anything else Inside the Box get you get a little hang tag with the sneaker there's little QR code there if you guys want to scan it Superstar on there the official description is SuperStar I I don't even know Superstar Originals Adidas Superstar Originals I don't think it's got it in there just in different languages but yeah it just says Superstar original so that they're basically the same as the OG ones super cool size seven let's get down to the materials so starting off with the heel plate it looks really really cool white and black Adidas just there then you get like a flimsy synthetic leather on the tongue and syntic leather all around the upper on the shoe it's pretty nice like it's but it's really hard so this does add to the discomfort of the sneaker I wouldn't say these are the most comfortable sneakers but I definitely would suggest if you want to buy these to double up on socks for a little bit then you got the label just there looks really cool the Adidas strip on the side again a synthetic lever you got your breathability holes just there really nice you got that Superstar right there which looks really dope I love that that's a nice little touch against the label see that at the same time really nice then you got this beautiful traction on the bottom it looks really nice it looks really like it would be good on a basketball court but yeah guys that's basically all the materials and the focus point of this sneaker for me is the shelter the shelter looks super dope and for me that's definitely the one reason that I wanted it they're break dance and shoes to me cuz this what I used to wear the brake dance even though I was terrible at brake dancing that is what I wanted to get them for L Ser made soft car really nice and then there's a little message on the inside of the sneaker I'm going to read it to you it says the brand with three stripes in three different languages super dope one of Adidas best sneakers ever made in my opinion but materials are trash they need to like revamp it the mids is made out of rubber and the shelter is made out of rubber also let me know what you're thinking about these in the comment section guys so far okay so on Google it does state that it's a real lever all around the shoe but yeah I believe that is a synthetic lever personally but I'm not 100% but yeah just so I got my facts on the video it could be a real lever all the way around but it does feel like it's a synthetic lever if I'm 100% honest so guys we've done the materials now we're going to be going through the comfort and the sizing and then we're going to do the rating so Comfort overall in this sneaker is about like a seven six to seven out of 10 it's not a really comfortable shoe but with jeans it looks really looks really cool durability I don't think they're that durable and how NBA players used to wear these I don't know cuz for me I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't play sports in them I personally I couldn't because the the materials so tough that they they chew your foot apart overall they're a super dope sneaker looks wise the sneaker is aesthetically pleasing visually and they're very breathable so breathability they're good looks wise they're good but comfortability not so great so for sizing I've got a really narrow foot when you put your foot into this sneaker it doesn't fit really well straight away it's one of those you have to wear for a couple of weeks to to wear them in make make the lever really loose um or the synthetic lever I should say it it doesn't really fit really comfortable straight away there's not a lot of padding the label's kind of tough um the levers really really hard especially I don't know if you can hear that but around that area in particular really really tough so for sizing these sneakers do not fit true to size these sneakers need to be bought half a size down for me because I got narrow feet so if you're looking to buy these sneakers I would suggest trying them first if you can't try them and you have narrow feet go half a size down these sneakers are slightly too big for me so I have to double up on socks just to wear them I've got a gap at the back and it doesn't hook my foot like it should so I have to have the laces stupidly tight and you can't Tu these laces under because it makes it uncomfortable to wear so I'm stuck wearing these sneakers like this but it's okay because classically worn the laces r so I don't mind but yeah fitting wise personally I would say go down half a size if you're not if you're not used to wearing a d go down half a size overall a super classic sneaker looking really dope I love it gives me pure hip-hop Vibes we're going to have to rate the sneaker I'm going to have to give it an 8 out of 10 purely because of the bad Comfort on it they're not the greatest comfortable sneaker but the memories and the classicness of a sneaker make makes him an eight out of 10 for me guys let me know what your thoughts are down below in the comments leave your thoughts your feelings your opinions down in the comments tell me what you think of these sneakers would you buy them I got them for £41 man that's an absolute steal for a beautiful classic sneaker that brings back so much Nostalgia memories for me we used to wear these in the 90s and they absolutely killed it guys if you did enjoy this video hit like subscribe turn the notifications thank you so much for watching and until the next review have a great day and stay safe

hUiL5s3-Xbs,Vans Old Skool,well done hey what's going on youtube today we're going to be taking a look at every high schooler's favorite shoe we're going to be looking at the classic vans old school the old schools retail for 60 washington's they're pretty much beloved by just about everyone and we're gonna see why that is we're gonna be taking a close look at the upper the outsole gonna see how these hold up on feet and lastly i'm gonna give some final thoughts on the shoe first let's take a quick look at the shoe's inception the shoe was released back in 1977 and it was originally called the van style number 36. it was the first real skateboard specific shoe designed from the ground up by vance a real step up from the previous vans era which was really just a more cushioned version of the vans authentic moving on to the upper the upper is made out of canvas with suede overlays suede overlays include the toe cap the eye stays and the heel overlay the tongue and the side panels are made out of canvas at the side we also have the iconic van stripe it's actually called the jazz stripe i actually didn't know it was called that you know nice little fun the stripe is actually made of leather not canvas or suede but leather which i found interesting just because that's the only piece on the shoe that is leather lastly inside the shoe we have a faux leather lining with padding similar to the vans era overall we have a slim low top silhouette and you can immediately tell that these are a big upgrade over its predecessor the old schools use the same vulcanized diamond outsole as pretty much every other van shoe the insole is also glued in just like every other van shoe that uses this outsole which kind of sucks for me because i wish i could take a look at the insole i don't want to have to cut it out but it's whatever i guess on feet these fit true to size for me and to my surprise they were actually pretty comfy i mean the bottom of these feel just like any other classic van shoe because they pretty much use the same outsole slash insole but because these have some suede i thought that the upper would feel a bit uncomfortable and stiff but they felt pretty good they weren't stiff at all slip them on and go there's no real break in time required i really like how they look on feet they really have that classic sneaker look to them very cool overall the shoe back then was a real game changer the more durable upper made it popular with the skateboarders and today it continues to be popular and cool i mean pretty much anything that the skaters use become popular and cool especially in high school pretty much all the skater stuff was cool to wear except for these these were never cool at least not where i went to school the simple silhouette of the old schools make the shoe very versatile i would definitely recommend this shoe to just about anyone unless you're just not a fan of vans but other than that it's a really good shoe well that's going to be it for the video guys comment down below if you guys want me to review a specific shoe i hope you guys found it helpful like and subscribe if you did and i'll see you guys in the next one you,2025-06-23 14:38:20.000502 UTC
aj6zoLT3YsA,Onitsuka Mexico 66,well hey what's going on guys today we're going to be looking at a shoe from a brand that i've been wanting to try out for a while now this is the onitsuka tiger mexico 66 in the white and blue colorway issues retail for a hundred dollars even and i'm going to be leaving a link down in the description if you guys want to check out the shoe for yourselves we're going to be looking at the upper the midsole and outsole and lastly we're going to be seeing how these hold up on feet so let's get into it the upper is mostly made out of a leather and it has some suede touches leather is soft but it does feel like decent quality for the price on the toe we have a suede t-shaped toe cap and rubber toe cap just below that both of which we're familiar with on many adidas shoes moving up we have flat white laces on the tongue we have a sonan onitsuka tiger patch the tongue actually has a bit of padding behind it for that extra bit of comfort now we have no extra padding on the lining of these shoes it definitely feels like they're staying true to that 1960s original way of building the shoe on the side we have the oneetsuka stripes in blue and red which are also the a6 stripes at the rear we have the tiger lettering on a flap it looks unfinished but i really like it for its uniqueness the heel cross is also very unique and cool looking unatsuka says it's for stability then underneath that we have another touch of suede for the midsole we have a slim strip of eba foam then we have a rubber outsole with a very unique tread pattern it's a triangular pattern that covers the entirety of the bottom of the shoe unfortunately the insole is glued down and i was unable to remove it but it seemed to be an eva insole onatsuka tiger also says that the shoe has an ortholite sockliner for moisture management i did go true to size on these and they fit well for me so i would say to go true to size as i mentioned before the lack of any real lining inside the shoe makes for a very raw and bare bones experience on feet because of this i got quite a bit of heel slippage i had to lace them up all the way to the top and that helped a lot these shoes feel and look very slim and sleek on feet so if you have wide feet these may not be the most suitable shoes for you i would definitely try them on in person before buying them because the eba midsole is so slim it did little to cushion the heels i feel like that's the theme with these shoes very slim very bare bones you get a lot of ground feel like with many other trainers but more so with these personally though i love this shoe i really like that stripped down raw feeling of the shoe and i like how slim they are they look fantastic on feet and because of the slimness and round toe box of the shoe they remind me of the wabaki from tokyo drift like if the wabaki was a sneaker overall like i said i really like this shoe if it's good enough for bruce lee it's good enough for me pretty crazy that the shoe was released back in 1966 at the time it was originally called the limber up kawa bk which is kind of a weird name but we now know the shoe as the tiger mexico 66. i would definitely recommend this shoe if you're looking for some slimmed down shoes or you're just looking for some nice trainers that's going to be it for the video guys like and subscribe if you guys found the video helpful like i said i'm going to be leaving a link down below if you guys want to check out the shoe for yourselves and i'll see you guys in the next one,2025-06-23 14:44:44.824702 UTC
L-G5yfybKMs,Adidas Superstar,well you guys time for the superstar review that you guys can't stop asking about in every single Instagram post ever like five or six times from different people forever okay you want to know what these shoes are like alright I'm gonna tell you right here it is so what are these first of all these are the adidas superstar otherwise known as shell toe ad V so that doesn't mean bulk you know the other ones were called the adv like add bulk and they had a vulcanized sole which a lot of people weren't crazy about I thought that was actually a good idea because it would have had more grip and board feel than a vulcanized I mean then a capsule which this one is but those ones I think they wanted to differentiate from those in a way because those ones had something really dumb going on they had a dumb insole which looked grippy it was like rubbery and it grabbed your sock and was hard to put on that looked lame these ones don't have that these ones just have a relatively thin foamy rubbery insole it's actually really nice and not only that they're actually kind of squishy even underneath the insole so it seems like they have a little bit of extra padding in there on top of the rubber and you'll be happy to know that all of that greatly reduces your board feel when you first try these shoes on so let me fill you in on what I'm talking about so first I was skating alaka'i cops'll when I first set up this eight-point-five deck you know what it felt awesome and I loved it and I had titanium 149 Zahn Indy's and it was just a wicked setup but the weird thing is as soon as I changed into the issues I couldn't feel the board it made the board feel softer and it made everything feel too light as soon as I switched a 149 standard the board actually felt the right weight and I could skate it in these shoes on that first day has anyone else noticed that let me know in the comments if you have bought new shoes about midway through your deck and your deck that felt super awesome all of a sudden felt cold and soggy because I've had that happen a bunch of times when getting new shoes alright next let's look at how these are differentiated from the other shell toes so I don't have a pair of those but some of the things are I believe this rubber is a little bit grippier and more supple yes duffel so I think it flexes a little bit easier I think it has more board feel and more grip because these do feel better in those areas than the traditional one in my opinion the other thing is it has more double stitching so it's a little bit more beefed up in certain areas so they haven't been falling apart too quickly this thing flapped off for a while but I've just shoe boot it back down which while we're on the subject why don't we get into durability so I've been skating these for almost four weeks and I've had like a really grippy jessa ultra grip I had a brand new deck when I set these up and I'm super kickflip II and 360 flippy and frets like flippy and backside flippy and a lot of kick flippy things and this is all I've got in three and a half weeks I usually blow through like every shoe I have in three and a half to four weeks no matter what so I'm actually really impressed with how durable that is the lace breakage situation has not been rad they break really quickly on this one but then don't break on the other ones for a long time but okay here it comes my number one gripe about these shoes is they look really stupid as soon as the lace breaks you guys see that how it's all swoopy like do you see what I mean it like swoops up like a little launch ramp so the other ones don't do that they sit flat right they sit a little bit flatter and they look flush with the tongue of the shoe but on these you've got like a ski jump on your shoe as soon as your lace breaks you see that and it looks really dumb the fact that I've just said that twice lets you know how much I mean it I hate the way they look when the lace breaks three times now I've said it part of the reason they look so weird is because of the tongue so these also have a super thin tongue they don't have the padded tongue like the standard super star it's very thin and I think if it had a thicker tongue that would flush out to the top of the thicker tongue and not look so lame okay next let's get into the durability of the sole the durability of the sole is actually really good I wear this one out really fast on every shoe but look at that it hasn't even gotten to the flat part of the sole yet so in three and a half weeks with all my scoochie little kickflip tricks I usually wear through this and that so fast so these are really durable in the sole I absolutely feel like I'm getting my money's worth and here's my right foot you know for reference right my switch foot not as much kickflip where this hasn't broken through the heels are in good shape my switch heel shoes usually get blown apart right here and that still looks really good so I'm totally getting my money's worth and in terms of that like I paid full price for these and I would actually pay full price for another pair of these because of how long they've been lasting me now when a shoe lasts a long time it usually comes with a pretty hefty break-in period and I would say that these took almost two weeks to really feel broken in now that being said I was able to skate well in them after about the second day finding the flick only took me like till the end of one session and these licking really nicely when you first start trying to flick in them it feels weird and bulbous but then once you find it it grabs it and throws them really nice the rubber for the flick on heel flips is also really good I had tons of pop in these shoes for both my kick flips and heel flip tricks because that rubber is so grippy grabby and throwing definitely like that but anyways you guys that is a whole lot of talking and because I'm only just filming this part I don't know if you've watched any skating yet but I didn't film anything specifically for this let's flush this out flesh this out flush let's flesh this out with a bunch of Instagram clips so you guys can see just how much fun I've been having in these shoes [Applause] [Applause] I'll take that okay so the final verdict on these shoes well I don't really have the final verdict on these shoes because I actually strongly suspect I'm gonna get about another three weeks out of these things but in terms of what I think about them I would buy another pair of these like I said I'm enjoying skating in them I absolutely love the look of them I love the look of the footage one of my first pairs of skate shoes back in the day back in about 93 was a pair of superstars so they have a special place in my heart you know watching old virtual reality videos and pretty much everybody in that video has superstars in at least one clip these things were hot back then with my giant green big deal new deal pants but anyways if you can't tell I did like these shoes I've been to moding all over them through the course of this entire video if you okay disclaimers here don't go buying them just cuz I said I liked them you might hate them if you love vans or you love any sort of vulcanized shoe that has a lot of board feel or you like any sort of shoe like a Janowski or something where you can really feel the board on the side of your foot a lot you might not like these shoes at all they really are a bulky cup sole and they take a long time to break in and start to have more control so if you don't know how to skate a bulky capsule then you're not gonna like this at first anyways I mean or you could follow the bendigo philosophy don't be a baby get used to it and maybe actually enjoy a different shoe for once no no whatever I mean different strokes for different folks takes all types no accounting for some people's tastes we could throw some more cliches in there but I don't wanna I gotta get going you know this video is over you should have figured that out by now I didn't even figure it out until just now but it is but I have a way of still talking when I'm on a roll so you know been for 20/20 filibustering another video signing out stop watching you guys get on your board go skate you know that's what you want to do hopefully things are awesome where you are why is your awesome now take off and be awesome,2025-06-23 14:43:35.335181 UTC

z5UGobMJRIk,Converse Chuck Taylor All Star,what is going on YouTube world I'm your brother resent this is kot life K life with the Y like subscribe comment all these things and in today's video I am going to be doing a longterm review on my Chuck tiller 70s because a lot of y'all have asked for it so here we go we're going to get right into the video and make this as uh to the point as possible so we're going to talk talk about four different topics uh Aesthetics durability comfort and would I buy this product again so let's start off with Aesthetics still a goodlooking shoe one of the things I love about this shoe is that it ages gracefully when you get these and they're new they look really clean they look good with outfits but in my personal opinion when this thing ages and it gets a little wear and a couple of scratches and stuff on it that's when it really starts to come into its own and look better there aren't very many sneakers out there that age gracefully like this but this is one of those sneakers for sure and that's one of the reasons why I love it a lot I put a decent amount of wear on it over the years that I've had it I've had it since um 2021 and I've worn it a decent amount of times not not anywhere near as many times as you would think but I've worn it a decent amount and I've put it through a lot of abuse I've actually gone running in these things uh I've done a three mile run in them and two sixmile runs in them because I was experimenting with another potential video I was going to make and aesthetically with all the wears here they still look pretty decent and while I'm talking about running them and stuff stuff I can also talk about durability the durability factor is definitely there because this sneaker is not designed to be a running shoe you know I was experimenting with Al running shoe Alternatives and it was actually a very comfortable um shoe to run in in the cold cooler months I ran in it in the summertime and that was not a really good thing because it's not so breathable but you know it was still you could do it if you really wanted to um I just finished running in them again and uh while you can running them they're not the best running shoe but they're also better than the worst running shoes I ever had if that makes any sense like the shape of the toe box and the canvas will give you blisters there's you know the sweat aspect they don't really breathe that good but if you want to do a you know a short 5K or something like that you can 100% do it uh and it's going to feel very different from like super high-tech running shoes is it the best thing to run in no is it the worst thing also no so yeah the durability is definitely there as you can see the sole and everything is holding up pretty good and that's on both models but on one model on one model on one of my one one of the pair you can see that cracks have actually started to form in the uh casing that goes around the lower of the upper the lower part of the upper and um for the price point and for what it is it is pretty durable but it's not common projects level of durability like these are only four years old and I don't really wear them that much and you can definitely see wear and tear on them you can see how much heel wear is on them so good for what they are in the price point but you're not going to get common projects level of durability out of this shoe like for context these common projects right here I've been wearing them since 2017 now durability is good let's talk about Comfort like I just told y'all I have run several 3M runs in these several sixmile runs in these shoes and the comfort is spot-on unless it's super super humid outside if you're trying to run in these and it's really humid you're going to get blisters period Point Blank but if it's a cooler dryer day this is a shoe that if you're on a vacation or if you need to go to the gym while you're traveling or something like that this is a shoe that you could actually run in and I've tried it myself so try it for yourself maybe it work for you but quick thing to note I do have narrow feet so um yeah the Comfort definitely there for me car and maintenance duh I just want to say this real quick I have washed these several times in the washing machine and every time I have washed them the canvas has really really withstood washing pretty good so I just wanted to add that in there and let y'all know that you can machine wash these things if you want to they take forever to dry but you can do it would I buy this again that's something I'm kind of torn about I thought about buying these again once I wear these all the way out but I would prefer to get the common projects version of the Stan Smith not Stan Smith why did I say Stan Smith of the Chuck Chuck Taylor 70 because I feel like the common projects version of this is for one thing cleaner because it doesn't have all these extra stitching and all these contrasts which you know the contrasting is cool depending on how you dress in your outfits but you know without all this contrast these shoes can look a lot cleaner and I know you can get all black chucks but all black chucks just kind of look kind of I don't know they just don't really do it for me but that being said would I buy it again probably if I can't find a um common projects equivalent because I feel like the common projects equivalent will pretty much resolve this issue right here with the cracking because common project Souls just lag last a long long time they're high wear they're grippy they're super comfortable as they age and you know this one isn't bad and you know it has the super thick sole in it so it's not horrible but it's uh you know it it's just it's not a common project let me I'll just say it like that it's not a common project but definitely worth the money so um yeah I'm your brother residence is car life car life for the Y like subscribe comment I want to make this one

RTnyX4YICI8,Reebok Club C 85 Vintage shoes,what is going on gang Eli here today we're going to be talking about the Reebok Club c85 vintage specifically my pair now I love my pair um you wouldn't be able to tell by looking at them but I do love my pair and I've had them for about 4 years and in that four years they've probably seen about two years worth of abuse maybe more but I wanted to talk about how well they've held up over the years we're going to talk about how well the upper held up how well the lower has held up how the Comfort has held up throughout the years and lastly we're actually going to clean them cuz Lord knows they need it and I also think that's going to give us a really good idea of how well they've really aged so let's jump right into it first up the upper now obviously I think the upper is actually held up pretty well it's obviously creased a ton ton but that's really to be expected especially with how soft the leather is I haven't really been able to see any major leather peeling they might actually be too dirty for me to tell but I haven't seen any major signs of leather peeling or any leather tears so that's really good what I have seen is a little bit of separation of the upper and the out sole but thankfully these are actually constructed really well they have a stitched upper to lowerer construction so there's not going to be any major separation thankfully it's most likely just the glue that's separated a bit but the upper has not fully separated the lining on the shoe has also held up really well it's that terry cloth lining that I love and it hasn't ripped or anything it's held up really nicely it's it's dirty obviously but it's held up really well and then the out soole now the outsole is pretty much the same story it's got a little bit of that heel wear and also some somewhere where the ball of your foot is it's obviously dirty as Sin but like I said overall nothing major on the outsole it's still very much intact now let's talk about the Comfort how it's held up this is probably I don't want to say it's my most comfortable shoe classic shoe wise this is probably one of the more comfortable shoes out there that EVA foam rains Superior it's very comfortable on feet and then with the soft leather on the toes makes it a fantastically comfortable shoe that you can wear all day I don't think it's as comfortable as it was when I first bought it obviously the wear and just the age of the shoe is going to make it not as comfortable as it used to be the foam feels a little more worn than it was when I first got them but overall still a very comfortable shoe the Comfort has definitely held up so that's enough talking let's go baptize these shoes to see if we can't redeem it of its sins so enjoy the Montage let's get it feel you Ain welcome back gang it's been a couple days and the shoes are finally clean and they're finally dry and they look good now that they're fully clean I can finally see if we have any scuffs on the leather and I definitely found some there were some scuffs on the toe area nothing too crazy just a couple little kind of scratches and little dings as well as a couple oh my gosh as well as a couple scuff marks on like the side and on the rear area as well like I mentioned before overall nothing major I also you know I wasn't wearing these hiking or anything or maybe I did obviously we still got some crazy creasing that's not really going to go away but I think overall they've aged relatively nicely I mean look look at that they look so clean and so yeah very happy with the way they cleaned up they cleaned up super well uh I probably could have scrubbed a little bit better on the back but yeah definitely a shoe that's definitely going to last you let me know what you guys think and I hope you guys learned something from this video like And subscribe guys and as always see you guys in the next one,2025-06-19 08:38:05.444674 UTC
BElt5nHL1zg,PUMA Suede,what is going on y'all i just got back from my fivemile run and my first run in the Sketcher Aero Sparks which is kind of like part of Sketcher's new lineup that they just released recently i think I've seen a couple of YouTube videos talking about the other models but I haven't really seen anything regarding the Aerospark model which I believe is meant to be kind of like a lower stack tempo daily trainer from Sketchers i would say that it's kind of in line with maybe the Brooks Hyperion line all that aside I just put five miles in the shoe and boy am I impressed so let's get right into it so as always we're going to start off with the outsole of the Aerospark so as you can see on the outsole it is a wavy interesting looking outsole pattern and as you can see in the branding they did partner with Goodyear which is the tire company so kind of like how Adidas works with Continental Rubber i think they used Goodyear rubber on the bottom of the outsole which is kind of impressive given that this shoe I picked it up for actually $120 from Running Warehouse but I saw on Sketchers website it's retailed for $130 so not exactly sure why there's a $10 price difference between the two websites and I think on Sketchers if you're a member which you probably just need to sign up with your email you can get an extra 20% off so with QuickMaths that's $26 off and you can get these for 104 directly from Sketchers so with all that being said I think that it's amazing that they gave us Goodyear rubber how did it perform on my little 5m run i would say that it wasn't the most sticky traction pattern or outsole pattern that I've had in a shoe i still think that Adidas Continental rubber when done right like not on the Evo SL i think that that's probably the stickiest rubber alongside Puma's Puma Grip not to say that these didn't perform well but I did run on the road and I felt like I was trying to you know wiggle and kind of swerve a little bit just to see how the traction would hold up and it was pretty responsive and it gripped the ground pretty well but nothing like extraordinary i would say that I would have to put a little bit more miles as well as different surfaces i'd be interested to see how these do on the sand to see how the rubber outsole actually holds up when it comes to traction durability wise I'm not even going to talk about cuz it's only been 5 miles so overall I think that the outsole is going to perform very well kudos to Sketchers for giving us a Goodyear collaboration especially at that nice price point of $120 to $130 at full price so that is amazing good job Sketchers i think that this this outsole is going to perform pretty decent moving on to the cushion setup of the Sketchers Aerosparks honestly I don't know too much about Sketchers tech stack or like what they use typically in their cushion setups so this is going to be pretty new to me they have a carbon infused hyperburst ice foam i don't even know what that means if it's a pea blend if it's EVA and stuff i'm going to just tell you guys how I felt in the shoe first impressions running 5 miles in these and honestly if I closed my eyes it really feels like Brooks's DNA tuned foam now I only have the Brooks Glycerin Max which is a $200 shoe to test out the Brooks Tuned or DNA tuned foam i don't have the Brooks Glycerin 22s which is their newer model that also has DNA tuned foam so I can't speak for that shoe but in my first impressions of a FiveM Run I did feel like this was a lower to the ground DNA tuned foam or it felt like DNA tuned which is amazing price at what it is um if I'm feeling like it feels similar to a $200 shoe obviously not the stack height of the shoe but just the feeling of the foam I think that's pretty impressive from Sketcher's point of view talking about the stack height really quickly cuz I did compare it to the Brooks Glister Max these are definitely not as high and these are meant to be kind of like more of an everyday daily trainer not a max cushion daily trainer so you have 36 mm in the heel dropping to 30 mm in the forefoot and overall the ride I did kind of negative splits so I started off at 9:30 for the first mile and then dropped all the way to around 7 minutes per mile on the last mile of the five mile run and honestly it held the pace all paces pretty well so from 930 per mile to 7 minutes per mile and I was really impressed honestly so I think that this foam just feels way more premium than you would typically get in a shoe that's priced at this price point around $120 to $140 and I think that the midsole in general I don't know if Sketchers copied Brooks or I don't know you know what's going on over there but um even the look of the midsole kind of reminds me a little bit of DNA Tuned where they kind of have a frosting soft rubber that encases the foam not exactly sure if you guys are going to be able to see it but once you see the shoe in hand it really looks like it and I was really impressed with the foam i would say that it's more on the soft side but the nice part is that since it has a lower stack in the forefoot you do still get a nice response from the ground and you get a nice ground feel but you still get the impact protection and the comfort from that soft cushion so overall I would say that the cushion setup was very versatile it was very comfortable it's just not the most responsive or bouncy foam in my opinion but it's nice that there's not too much in the forefoot so you do get that response and you don't feel like you're kind of sinking into the sand which sometimes in the Brooks Glycerin Max especially when I was trying to run faster I felt that the foam didn't really give me anything back and it made it hard to kind of pick up the pace and I felt like I was fighting against the cushion setup at times with that shoe but since it's a lower stack on the Sketch Sketchers Aerospark I felt like I didn't have that problem and I'm excited to see how the cushion setup lasts for long runs for tempo runs for all sorts of runs but for that first five miles the shoe felt really premium and definitely punching above its weight class when it comes to price and last but not least we're going to talk about the upper as well as the fit so with the upper we have kind of I think Sketchers called it an engineered mesh but in person it feels more like a knit i don't know exactly if it's just the color way that I have but as you can see this area the majority of the upper is kind of like a knitted or more premium mesh feeling material in my opinion and then we have on the eyelids we have a little bit of a synthetic slash I don't exactly know what material this is but it feels kind of like a newuk which is kind of like in between I think suede and leather um where it's kind of like it feels soft to the touch but it's not furry like suede is um I don't exactly love the feeling of that material because I feel like it adds weight to the shoe and I don't think that it was very necessary for them to add it but maybe they added it for durability around the eyelids as well as the tongue the tongue is gusseted and it is kind of like a thick or clunkier tongue which I also think they could have streamlined a little bit more just from first impressions but overall the shoe fit very well i have a slightly wider average foot than normal size 12 normal in all running shoes and my size 12 in this shoe fit really really well in my opinion the forefoot was not super snug but it kind of gave me a really good fit where I didn't feel like my toes needed any extra room and I felt like it was pretty snug the forefoot lockdown was really good and then the heel lock down I would say I didn't do the runner's loop for my first run and I didn't use the last eyelet and I'm going to try in my future runs to do the runner's loop because I typically do it in most of my running shoes but the heel lock down wasn't 100% secure but it was that feeling where it was you know 90% secure where I didn't feel like I needed to do the runner's loop to get that secure heel lock down but my heel didn't really move in the shoe at all too so I know that's a little bit confusing but just know that for support at least for me on the first run it was totally fine even though I didn't do the runner's loop so lock down and fit were amazing i think that if I do the heel heel loop I might have even better lock down which is always a good thing one thing to note about the upper of the Sketchers Aerospark if I would say that I had a complaint would be that the breathability wasn't very good in the upper it feels like a very thick knit knitted material and when I do the light test I do see that there are perforations within the upper to supposedly give some air flow but since the material is so thick I did feel like my feet got a little bit hot in the shoe but I'm also going to continue to put more miles on the shoe to really confirm if that's true or not whether the ventilation in the shoe is good i do wish that the upper was a touch thinner i do feel like it's a little bit thick and also some of the materials on the upper i personally if I was designing the shoe would have used maybe different materials to make the shoe even lighter so overall feeling I did feel like the shoe was decently light but I do think that if they they made the upper material a little bit thinner as well as they replaced that new book material with a lighter material and made the tongue a little thinner i'm I'm already redesigning the shoe but overall the shoe performed very well on my first run i'm very excited to put more miles in the shoe i never thought that I would be reviewing a Sketchers performance running shoe to be honest i know that every now and then Sketchers tries to do like performance running and they do put out some like really cool stuff but this is my first time actually biting the bullet and paying the price so talking about price again I got my pair for $120 on Running Warehouse again on sketchers.com it's going to be $130 USD but you do get that 20% off i think it's like a promotion that they're running right now if you are a member so keep that in mind so I am very excited to kind of use this as a daily trainer and see how it kind of holds up after all the miles that I put on the shoes so stay tuned for the full review let me know in the comment section down below if you would try Sketchers running shoes because honestly like I don't know maybe growing up I never really thought of Sketchers as kind of that performance brand it was kind of always that value and comfort brand so I'm really excited to put more miles on the shoe and who knows maybe I will test other Sketchers models if you guys are interested in that or if I really love this shoe that much i'd be excited to see what else they have to offer so with all that being said thank you guys so much for watching and stay tuned for the full review it will be coming in,2025-06-23 14:42:16.545672 UTC
8f5UrOGvDqA,Stan Smith,what is that my friends welcome back to your average jens my name is evan if you watched my video on things that will never go out of style you'll probably guessed that i love white sneakers because they look clean they're super versatile and they are easy to pair with anything and i especially love the converse Chuck Taylors I've been wearing them since secondary school that's more than ten years ago my goodness this pair is more than two years old and since it's gonna fall apart soon and I really want to try something new I've decided to get a pair Adi does Stan Smith which is on my wish list for quite a while already but don't worry Chuck's you'll always be my first look anyway I ordered this pair of Stan Smith about two months ago and I've been wearing it regularly recently and in today's video I'm gonna be giving my review of this pair of sweet kicks my review will be based on its aesthetics comfortability affordability durability and versatility first let's talk about is aesthetics how it looks undoubtedly one of the most iconic sneaker design I gotta say I really like the design and its silhouette it has a really slim profile although not as slim as the Chuck Taylors but it definitely does not look chunky at all I love how the design is really clean and minimalistic and even the adidas 3 stripes are just perforated at the sides I also much prefer the all-white version because the logos on the tongue and at the back of the shoe are much more subtle and this makes the shoe much more versatile which I'll get into later so for the all version is clean is minimal for aesthetics I'll definitely give it a solid 9 out of 10 next let's talk about its affordability you can find this for about 80 to 90 USD and in Singapore it retails for about 140 Singapore dollars I bought it for 100 Singapore dollars during Chinese New Year when there's a promotion so it is a steal for me but and 140 Singapore dollars I wouldn't say it's super affordable but considering that it is a pair of well-made shoe and it has really decent quality I would say most people can't afford it so for portability I'm gonna give it a 7 out of 10 mixed is is comfortability I'm not too worried about its comfort ability to be honest I mean it doesn't have any nike air max or adidas boost technology so I don't expect it to be super comfortable but it's decent it has a very standard insole and your feet wouldn't really get super tired when you wear this for the whole day the leather upper will get softer the more you wear them the comfortability is pretty comparable to the Chuck Taylors so for comfort ability nothing special pretty standard so I'm gonna give it a 6 out of 10 let's go on to durability as I said it has some pretty decent quality it has a leather apple and a rubber sole I really like mary has stitching's around the front half of the shoe to really make sure that the so stays strongly adhered to the upper a kind of which Congress did that overall if you look at the stitching's it is a very well constructed shoe and I hate to say this but I'm pretty sure it's gonna last longer than my converse converse you can step up your game speaking of durability I'm gonna talk about its maintenance since it's all White's you really have to clean it regularly to make sure that it is clean and fresh always because a dirty pair of shoes just looks bad and unstylish but since it's made of leather you can easily wipe off the dirt and the stains with a wet tissue or wet cloth so that's good but anyway for durability I'm gonna give it an 8 out of 10 pretty solid lastly its versatility is definitely the best for the summer you can wear it for spring and fall as well be somewhere for winter winter is for boots baby anyway this is definitely one of the most versatile pair sneakers even more versatile than the Chuck tailors in my opinion the Stan Smith is a little bit more classy so you could dress it up a little bit I like to wear this to a smart casual setting with a pair of chinos or trousers so he can really dress this up and dress it down so for versatility I'm gonna give this an 8 out of 10 so overall drumroll please I'm gonna give this an 8 out of 10 I'm really sick pair of speakers I really love them cannot wait to wear them more regularly I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking to buy a really nice and classic pair of sneakers which is very versatile as well it can be worn with any casual - smart casual outfits but just remember to clean it regularly and that is it for this week's video hope you find this review helpful if you like this video make sure to smash that thumbs up button subscribe if you haven't done so already and as always I will see you guys next week don't worry I still love you,2025-06-19 08:39:24.366197 UTC
Wo7k7tvozBE,Converse Chuck Taylor All Star,what is the real difference between your regular Converse All-Star High Toops and the Converse Chuck 70s that's what we're going to try to figure out by cutting these in half I'm through our test to really try to figure out which one of these could technically be called a slipper is the Chuck 70 actually better where does the name Chuck 70 come from which is more comfortable out of the two and is the Chuck 70 worth $30 more and if you don't know Commerce has a pretty cool and long history cuz it all started in 1917 for at least the allstars when the Commerce All-Star basketball shoe was introduced and became extremely popular during World War I but in 1922 a basketball player named Charles Chuck Taylor went to converse complaining about his sore feet and conver hired him as a brand ambassador and hints the name Chucks then over the next few decades conver became the shoe of choice for basketball within 1936 members of the US national basketball team won the Olympics taking gold beating Canada 19 to8 which is very low then in 1949 the baa and the national league merged together to form the NBA and nearly every single player was playing playing in Converse in 1962 when Wilt Chamberlain scored his Infamous 100 point game in a pair of Converse and then by the 1970s Chucks had peaked in their performance their popularity and really push this technology as far as was able to go but there were some New Kids on the Block with new technology that slowly starting take chunks out of their strangle hold on the industry with Nike Puma Reebok surpassing the technology of rubber and canvas then from the 1970 onward they just kind of slowly became less popular they they weren't really athletic shoes anymore they just became slowly more casual shoes and as convers fell out of the performance Limelight the quality slowly dropped to match the fact that they weren't performance shoes anymore but 40 years later in 2013 Converse launched the Chuck Taylor Allstar 70 which was built really similar to the the Converse at the peak of their performance in the' 70s hence the name Chuck 7s so what are the shoes that we're comparing well we got the Converse Chuck Taylor All-Star canvas we're just going to call them the allstars for the varation of this video they weigh 11.4 Oz they retail for $65 and they're made in Indonesia the way they position the allstars is edgy this week sporty the next 10 years from now TBD no matter how or when your style changes you can always come back to the classic the original Chuck Taylor Allstar an icon for every era which is very true I don't know if these have ever gone out of style I've always owned at least one or two pairs of Chucks for my entire life the competitor is the Converse Chuck 70 canvas they weigh 1B even they retail for $90 they're made in Vietnam and the way they position this is the Chuck 70 offers a blank canvas for you to tell your own stories through style or activity plus they nod to where it all began with their tried andrue design while modern Comfort updates bring your look into the present by 1970 the Chucks had evolved to become the Pinnacle of function and utility for sport and was considered the best basketball sneaker ever the Chuck 70 is built off the original 1970 design with premium materials and extraordinary attention to detail a shoe so rooted in Tradition it has its own instant history that's the Chuck 70 it's the shoe and if you want either of these check them out via link to my description on occasion if you use those links it helps out the channel and helps us out this is the nd4 this is the fourth iteration of me and Nick's handmade boots in Spokane Washington attempting to make the most overthe toop most ridiculous indestructible boots that you can actually still wear on a regular basis and for this one we're doing a really unique concept of trying to combine one of the most famous and iconic boots in all military history the jungle boot with the Pacific Northwest boot that Tamed the Pacific Northwest jungle combining the two jungle fighting boots into one single indd 4 the ultimate jungle Boot and to make it that extra redundant and over-the-top build we've added the classic rose Anil linan patch we introduced on the indd 2 and the coolest thing about this entire boot that is I just love so much is it's like we took a normal Pacific Northwest boot upper like imagine this without all this black here it would just be a green quarter panel and since we use such soft malleable breathable leather in the upper we basically built a cage around it it's like this exoskeleton of their waterers shield leather that still allows you to have the flexibility and malleability of this really soft leather that's still ridiculously thick it's like 3 mm while still being structurally strong and still being supportive and not overstretching and ripping the material so essentially took that same concept from the jungle boot where they had to reinforce it and create a frame around it in that exoskeleton and applied it to this boot with the ridiculously thick and malleable leather to try to combine all the best attributes of the Jungle boot with the Pacific Northwest boot to make the ind4 the ultimate jungle boot so check them out below they drop on July 27th if you want Early Access by 4 hours be sure you're on the limited edition email list will link below and there's only 500 available so make sure you're ready for the drop on the 27th so like I mentioned we're going to call these the allstars and the Chuck 7s and we're going to go through all the details let's start with the upper first it has that classic canvas upper that convers are known for it's 66 mm thick and is a pretty flexible fabric that you shouldn't have to really break in much at all compare that to the 70s this is a lot more thick and more durable canvas it's 1 mm thick so that's where you get some more that rigidity it's going to take a little bit longer to break but you should get some more durability and longevity out of this canvas compared to the all-star canvas and to see if that's true we did the puncture test on these the allstars took 38.5 lb puncture through while the Chuck T the Chuck 7s took 49 lb so was the Chuck 70 actually better and more performance inspired well it's got thicker and more durable canvas for more support and durability so yes to me but what about the insid this is something that the convers has at least changed with this version of the allst Stars I'm not sure if it's all the way through even like the classic black pairs but on this white pair you've got a kind of a typical sneaker liner and a lot of times this more sneaker type lining is not as durable as a heavy canvas cuz if you compare that to the Chuck 7s this has another canvas on the inside it's about as thick as the upper the outer canvas of the regular Allstars I lean towards thinking it's going to be more durable but more importantly the the spot that these shoes wear out the most on the inside at least right at that hill where you get a little heel slip to start wearing through that lining with the Chuck 7s you have a complete you have a full dedicated internal counter cover that is another layer of canvas which is backed by the actual counter and it has a binding all the way around it so there's just more and thicker material to wear through and it structures that heel a little bit more than the regular Chucks so are the Chuck 7s actually better and more performance inspired they clearly are and one thing I didn't notice until right before recording this is this little Stitch line here I just thought it was kind of a classic looking Stitch line from the OG like from the 70s but it actually is a functional Stitch because on the inside the lining wraps a little bit further from the vamp adding an extra layer and Stitch line sewes that upper to that Vamp layer giving you a little bit more material to wear through it a little bit more structure and that Stitch is actually functional which I really like so clearly the Chuck 7s are better and more performance inspired what about the insoles well they're basically the same insole the Chuck 7s are just removable whether all stars or not and they're they're built the same way with the lining material on top some open cell foam underneath and then this wedge of this black material the difference between the two besides the allstar is not being removable I'm just going to remove it you can still remove it it's just glued down more and it's tacked down more but the difference being that black wedge on the All Star is a foam versus the Chuck 7s is a blown rubber so the allstars are a little bit softer at 25 Shore a whereas the Chuck 7s are 50 Shore a so the allars are going to be a little bit softer and squishier Under Foot which might lead you to think they're going to be more comfortable but once we have those out you can see the allstars just have your typical lasting material strouble stitched to the upper whereas the Chuck 7s have a 5mm foam layer that is kind of a memory foam consistency and that adds a lot of extra Squish and comfort outweighing the extra squish you get from the foam in the wedge from the allstars making the Chuck 7s more performance inspired and more comfortable what about the out soole this is this is my favorite part about uh Commerce is they're so freaking sneaky and tricky with this because they both have rubber outsoles but you'll notice the allstars have a little bit of fuzziness on the bottom here and the reason they do that is really sneaky and tricky because if you have felt on the bottom of the shoe you can technically consider it slippers and that has an import Tariff of 3% whereas a sneaker without felt is considered a sneaker has an import fee of 37% which is 12 and A3 times more expensive to import than just slippers so that's why on all your Converse they always have that weird felted material it's that's a little workaround that they're doing to make these cheaper or increase their margins either way but they're pretty cheap they're only 60 bucks but as for the actual quality of the outsoles it seems like they're about the same you know that felt is going to be a little bit more slippery compared to rubber but the durometers are both 70 Shore a and it looks like they're basically the exact same pattern around the same depth the Chuck 70 does have a little bit deeper grooves and and reliefs in the out soole and so it might be a little bit thicker but we'll see when we get it cut in half but we wanted to run the bar drop test on it to see how those different internal layers uh affected the rebound the allstars bounced up 11.4 in the Chuck 70s bounced up 13.4 in so I'm assuming that comes from those extra layers the more rigid wedge and that that bit of 5 mm foam through the midsole but an interesting result was we did the puncture test test and the all stars took 75 lb of puncture through the Chuck 7s took 59 lb so there might be some differences on the inside of the all stars that we don't see in the Chuck 7s so are the Chuck 7s more performance inspired and more comfortable it's not really enough to say they are but I think the felt is less grippy than just straight rubber then finally to the construction both of them are vulcanized and if you don't know what Vulcanizing construction is it's really interesting because they use thin strips of rubber they call foxing and before that rubber is fully cured they attached the out soole to the upper by basically using that tape to tape it together then they're put in big ovens and then that rubber is fully cured binding it and bonding it to the upper material and the out soole which has its pros and cons it's easier to break in you have more ground feel and it's a more affordable way to make sneakers the cons are it's not as durable it's not as squishy and they just wear out faster everyone that has has a pair of Chucks actually I'll show you exactly what I'm talking about if you look at Josh's pair of Chucks you can see here that foxing did not hold up and he's completely blown out the side of the shoe which wouldn't happen with the cup sole or literally any other kind of construction that's why Vans and Chucks always do this because they're vulcanized so is there a difference between the two well there actually is because the Chuck 7s have a reinforced fiber structure in the actual foxing itself so it's going to be more durable it's going to be stronger it's not going to wear as fast and it has taller sidewalls giving you more adhesion to the actual material it might not delaminate as much and it could be more durable so to me the Chuck 7s are better and more performance inspired but that's just the outside so let's cut them in half see what's on the inside and see if we can figure out why this had better puncture test and answer all the those questions [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] all right we got them both cut in half if you're not subscribed consider doing it's just a little click and it's what allows us to afford to cut apart two brand new pairs of shoes in every single every single week week I'm going to show you to everybody look at this little guy look at this guy this is Taco toaster cousin and he's cute and really annoying so now shut up so I can record look at this anyway so let's see what's inside so are there any real differences between them that we didn't notice that might have given the allstars a better puncture test not really there's really nothing else that we missed the outsole of the Chuck 7s is a little bit thicker but for the most part they're identical so then which of these is more comfortable well clearly the Chuck 70 is to me at least I you know Comfort is very subjective but with all the different layers and the extra foam in the middle it's just more comfortable to me but is it actually better I think it is I think basically every component is better than the allstars through and through so is it worth that extra $30 well for me it is going from $60 to 90 is still a 50% increase in the price but for me the extra longevity the materials the extra Comfort is worth $30 but that doesn't mean that I haven't bought tons and tons of just regular Chucks because they are 60 bucks and they do last a decent time they they're goodlooking and they're just hard to beat you know you can pick up a pair of basically anywhere they're really affordable and and they're just that classic iconic look but the Chuck 70 is more durable it's it's more comfortable it hearkens back to the the the peak of Converse when it was The Chew of choice in the 70s when it maxed out all the potential benefits and gains you could get from canvas and rubber and vulcanized construction it's the peak of Converse and it's really cool they're still making it today or at least a version of it and so maybe we'll try to find a pair of Converse from the 70s and see if it really is as close as they're saying or if it's just more of like the marketing Spin and trying to sell the exact same product for the different lens cuz I hope it's true to the original so if you guys want to see that let me know because if this video does well that's how we kind of decide what we're going to do so support this video and let me know your experien in these what you think of them so thank you guys for watching this be sure to check these out the link in my description and

kIekxx-_xy4,Vans Old Skool,what is up YouTube we are back with another shoe review this time I have a pair of classic Vans this is going to be a very quick video because everybody uh is pretty familiar with classic Vans uh they have the honeycomb Souls these are the like Original Classic Vans uh or no I think these are the like I don't know the originals are different but these are like the classics or whatever they call them anyways a little nicer a little thicker um it's like the canvas has some padding in it I'll throw up the name of these uh the exact style but um these are the wides so these are the Vans wides um last time I went into the store I was getting a pair and they offered me a pair of Vans these are my second pair of wides the first pair actually is down here but they're absolutely covered in Grass I use them as my my shoes that I do yard work in now so um but these Vans I got the black ones I've had these for a couple months now um still holding up well you know of course uh wearing out just a little bit in the toe area and underneath the ball of the foot pretty standard uh with Vans after a couple of months but they're holding up together pretty well there's the souls haven't really split from the shoe I haven't really washed these a lot of the times I wash my Vans because I like getting the white SES um but these are the all black ones so they look pretty good when they're dirty still um I haven't washed them I don't know if that's made them last longer I'm assuming it has um washing them probably breaks down the glues a little bit and the the soles between the uh the bond between the canvas and the rubber but anyways you guys these are good I will say the wides um it is noticeable it is a noticeable difference um my cat's scratching at the back door but the wides you guys it is a noticeable difference I put the wides on when I was there and immediately I said I'm getting these um because apparently in in some older videos of mine uh I don't know if it was my t a video or I can't remember which one but somebody said you have a wider foot and um I never really thought about it and I guess I was like all right I guess I do have a wider foot I don't really have a narrow foot um but it's not super wide I don't need like crazy wide shoes but everybody knows uh is a kind of a growing Trend now or an awareness in Footwear that uh The Wider toe is better for your your foot it's better for your gate it helps your toes spread out you can kind of grip the ground better uh so The Wider toe isn't is a thing these are very very comfortable so more comfortable than the regular ones in my opinion the wide toe is nice it's not so wide that it's like a duck foot you know like some Vivo Barefoot but it's wide uh enough and it feels good it feels good I don't know why they never made vans in wide before but they are nice the black has held up really well they have worn down a little bit on these these the heel right here on the outside portion of the heel I don't know if that's because when I'm driving my feet are like this uh on the brake in the gas or well I guess I'm only using one foot I don't know I don't know what that's from but it wore out on the outsides of the the little heel here um I don't mind it you guys they're black they're nice they're clean uh they look good when they're dirty they look better than the whites when they're dirty um although I do love a pair of white Vans that's usually what I I rock I like whites white Vans uh but the black ones are cool they're good um they don't show the dirt I have not wash these faded a little bit on the outsides but I've had them for a couple months you guys if you're looking to get the wide bands I would I think they're super comfortable better than the uh original ones in my opinion uh they fit my foot better they do allow my toes to kind of spread out a little bit more they would be good for working out they'd be good for like you know lifting and squats and things like that lifting shoes uh but yeah you guys Vans all black uh Els you guys I just ordered a new pair of PF fers in 10 and 1 halfs again so maybe I'll do another giveaway with those I have two pairs of 10 and 1/2 PF fers that I can't wear now I might return those uh but I still have a pair to give away so we're going to figure out how to do that nobody seems very interested in my PF fer giveaway but um if you are click like And subscribe and we'll figure out how to do that thank you guys for watching these were the Vans wides the classics um go get a pair it's worth it the wides are very very comfortable and the black ones hold up very well so thank you guys for watching click like click subscribe and I will see you guys on the next one,2025-06-23 14:38:24.407911 UTC

t1v0tNPunZM,Adidas Gazelle,what makes a shoe a classic an icon a staple that should be in every collection honestly that's a hard question to answer but I think I might have something that fits the bill in all three of those categories I am Jacques Slate and today I bring you everything you need to know about the Adidas Gazelle Now for those unfamiliar with the Gazelle let's go back in history a bit The model was first launched back in 1966 and is rumored to be named after Olympic athlete Wilma Mar Rudolph who they often called Black Gazelle after winning three gold medals at the 1960 Olympics in Rome Now that has yet to be confirmed but it is a good place to start for this See when the Gazelle was originally launched it was released in two versions One was red and one was blue Back then at least with this model the colors weren't there just to tell a story like they are today They represented a different version of the same shoe The differences were mostly based on the outsole of the shoe with the red being made for outdoor training and the blue being made for indoor training Now in addition to the outsole the Gazelle was also the three stripes first shoe made of suede like these or as they were called back then kangaroo velour Apparently to some folks this was a big deal because soon after the shoe launched it became one of the hottest shoes in the Adidas lineup From major sports events to just a shoe to rock on the streets the Gazelle was the people's choice and Adidas even decided to update the outsole to a more universal look in 1972 The new hexagonal shaped outsole helped officially make the Gazelle the training shoe to get Fast forward to the 80s and '9s and Adidas continues to tweak the look and feel of the Gazelle to fit the time From the introduction to new colorways something like this to adding padding at the ankle or changing the heel shape the look and feel of the shoe stayed mainly the same but changed a little bit That brings us to the pairs that you see here Though the Gazelle is mainly the same it has transitioned to two versions of the shoe Let's call them like the Gazelle and then the Gazelle OG See the Gazelle OG is just as the name implies true to the original look of the shoe from the 60s But the Gazelle though not much different from the original does have a few changes changes such as a slightly longer tongue As you can see here this could be a result of the longer toe box The OG's toe box is a little short Now in addition to the tongue the Gazelle is a bit more streamlined than the OG As you can see in this profile the OG looks fatter by comparison A small difference yes but it also played a part in how you rock these At the end of the day another change is the heel The heel of the Gazelle is shaped to hug the heel and it's more contoured to the shape of your actual foot Now the OG on the other hand only has a slight wrap around the hip which makes it easier to put the OG's on For me the smoother clean look of the Gazelle wins over the OG which is why I'll probably be grabbing a few of these colors this summer Adidas has a ton coming Um Originals has a rich heritage when it comes to kicks And the Gazelle is basically one of the many that have stood the test of time and reached the levels of what I would consider to be a classic sneaker I mean think about it The shoe was originally launched over 50 years ago and you can still see people rocking these today like they just dropped yesterday So I want to know what do you guys think of the Adidas Gazelle is the retro vibe right did Adidas do the model justice with the latest update to the colors These colors are crazy Let me know your thoughts down below and make sure you hit that thumbs up button to help share the knowledge of the Adidas Gazelle I want to give a big shout out to Finish Line who actually helped make this video possible I am your host Jacques Slade This is everything you need to know about the Adidas Originals Gazelle And as always I appreciate you I'll see you soon Peace And I'm taking these with me if I can get all of them in my hand All right,2025-06-23 14:38:58.810348 UTC
_VklWmMcRUs,New balance 550,what to know about the new balance 574s before you buy them one these mofos are comfy two go trud to size should give you about a/4 in of toe space three they'll end up costing the same if not more on resale sites so just buy retail four it's mostly a suede shoe with a mesh toe box five they're oddly harder to style than other dad shoes I'm not sure why maybe it's just me six they're available in wide and extra wide sizing seven they retail for $9 and it's the shoe from Initial D,2025-06-23 14:50:48.974064 UTC
MAH7_C9KaNQ,New Balance 2002R,what's going guys welcome back to another video so this is not a tech review but um these are some new shoes that I picked up always loved reviewing shoes um so I decided to pick up some new balance these are size 12 um know it might be a little bit hard to see the box here but yeah so I picked up uh these are 2002 RS um that's the name they retail for like 140 bucks but I got these at a new balance Discount Store um here in Massachusetts so here they are right here um really fresh shoe so we're going to get into just my thoughts and why I decided to pick these up so I obviously love New Balance I love the fact that the shoe is either American or um I guess a British made shoe um so most of new balance is made in the USA however they do have um a manufacturer in the uh United Kingdom so these are the American uh versions so what's really nice about the shoe not only is it a really good just everyday wear um you can also run obviously with it train but it's pretty fresh um so let's get into it on the side we have this nice kind of suede material um and it kind of follows throughout the entire shoe it's not pretty much like on one side it kind of comes in and out it's definitely more on the toe box right here um so it's a nice just suede material feels really really really soft you can definitely tell that it's um good material there's a few layers of it um on the middle so you have that uh New Balance logo is super clean it is reflective so if you are running at night um and a light does shine near it it's going to reflect obviously um so you do have that reflective material uh there's kind of hints of it throughout the entire shoe it's not you know the entire shoe is reflective but um you do see it every now and then um there is this um kind of I don't know if you call this plush I always forget the name of what this is called mesh material plash mesh material on the toe box so obviously your toe uh when you're running you're not going to have all the sweaty feet that's just trapped um which I feel like happens with a lot of running shoes um again you have that suede material that follows um with black which I think looks really really nice um goes all the way to the back of the shoe um you kind of have a darker gray um mesh material as well uh which is nice that goes into the back of the shoe um but again really nice just simple colorway you have that light gray the dark gray black which is really nice um one of my favorite features about this shoe specifically um and I'll try to show you guys right here but there's a 2002 um R um which looks really nice obviously that kind of retro feel um which is great but so far you know really really clean um I do like the the midsole um obviously has a good amount of support uh which is obviously a big deal with New Balance shoes um having enough support um if you're running training doing anything like that on the back of the shoe we have a little New Balance logo um with kind of a it's a harder material I I don't even know what I would really call this but it's texturized uh but it looks really nice again more reflective material at the top um and I'll get into the inside of the shoe in a minute uh on the bottom Again part of the sole we have kind of these uh little cushion um areas I don't know if there's air that's filled inside of those but um really really comfortable which is great uh moving on to the uh tongue we have the New Balance running logo with black uh mesh material with that reflective going down um obviously with the tongue and then a little New Balance logo right there which is great the uh inside of the shoe is really really comfortable my favorite part about the shoe so far um while owning this is the um heel support it's so so soft um almost has kind of like a fleece material um but really really soft even the tongue too is it's really thick it's a wide tongue as well which is great um and the footed is incredibly soft uh I put these on it felt like I was putting on a really worn like glove and if you haven't played baseball you wouldn't understand but like putting on a glove that's already been used it just it fits right in so right when I put my foot in I'm like this is so so comfortable um it's just super clean like a very clean colorway that can go with a lot we with jeans sweatshirt or sweatpants joggers anything like that um going down to the sole we have this uh black sole um with a mix of white um the New Balance logo on the bottom so good traction again this these are great for running walking um everyday wear which is awesome so yeah both pairs I mean are both shoes just incredible um normally I wear size 12 there are some shoe brands where I will fit in like a 12 and 1/2 sometimes even 11 and 1/2 it's very strange but I feel like New Balance fits true to size which is great um I can wear 11 and2 for New Balance but I prefer wearing 12 it just gives me a little bit more room um and I don't feel like my foot is kind of like trapped in the shoe if that makes sense um but yeah so I definitely recommend if you're able to get the this shoe definitely look on a discount store before you end up buying it uh for full retail but um let me show you guys what they look like on feet um and then just my final thoughts about uh these New Balance shoes so guys super clean again you have that reflective material which is right there uh the tongue is just super comfy which is great so obviously if you're someone who likes to show off um that part of the shoe you definitely can do that um which is great you know again I I do like the black tongue I think it kind of matches well like if you wear black joggers or even just pans kind of stands out a little bit which is great um again super clean love this mesh material uh on that yeah just really really comfortable shoe super super comfy you know I for a while I wasn't always wearing New Balance shoes but I'm happy I'm back into it cuz these shoes are amazing um and again uh the retail price for these is normally $139 however got these discounted uh New Balance um discount stores Factory Stores uh they'll put a little like tag um which obviously allows for discount so yeah these are the 2002 RS uh let me know down in the comments below what do you guys think of the shoe would do you pick up New Balance anyways thank you guys so much for watching appreciate it I'll see you guys in the next video peace out bye,2025-06-23 14:45:47.897029 UTC

2kcMXD2Bdz4,PUMA Suede,what's going on everybody in today's video we have the Ghostbuster Puma collaboration unboxing now big shout out to Puma for sending these over I'm not too sure which shoe that I have here there were two shoes that dropped in the collection there was the stay puffed and also the Slimer the boxes are the exact same on both pairs that are of course this Puma Ghostbuster theme and this was to celebrate the 40th anniversary so the laces give this one away this is going to be the Slimer pair which I was kind of interested to see how this would turn out cuz as you can see we got blues and reds there but it seems like what people were doing was they were putting these as one uh so it's kind of interesting and it kind of makes this green colorway Pop I think this would be a really good lace option I'll put a picture up here uh somewhere on the internet I'm not sure whose photo this is I think this looks really good in this Slimer colorway here it is the Slimer Puma Ghostbuster suede XL and of course the coolest detail is maybe perhaps the hot dog with the semi-translucent build midsole and outs soole that we get on this sneaker now if you've never had the Puma XL suede this shoe is so so comfy and I don't know what it is I don't know if it's the actual insole that they put in here and I think it's kind of somewhat the insole and also this midsole and out soole but these sneakers are so so comfy especially for a flat build sneaker now you may be interested in the Puma XL maybe perhaps that's why you clicked on today's video this might be a little too bold for you I will link Down Below in the video description some brand new colorways they have a brown colorway a black colorway that they just released in this model uh that are very dressable but for the Ghostbuster Enthusiast that and clicked on today's video if you don't know who Slimer is he's a ghost and Ghostbusters that likes to eat all the food that goes around hence the hot dog that we have there on the out soole and he's a green ghost and maybe you've seen some of you know Bill Murray and some of the other cast that when they do get slimed they're getting slime trying to catch Slimer so he's one of the ghosts that's actually in Ghostbusters and that's where this exact inspiration from this low cut new buuck that kind of has a little bit of a yellow hits add kind of some discoloration now the second sneak the stay puffed and this one sold out absolutely everywhere and I think the reason why this one's sold out is because it's much more dressable this is a sneaker that if you're a Ghostbuster fan you know you can rock these on a daily basis and they're also very very dressable with the white suede upper with the hits of blue on this semi-translucent out sole we get of course stay puffed now the thing that I really like about this is the fact that you know stay puffed he's a chunky chunky one so the fact that this is a sneaker that's kind of a nod back to the style of the 2000s the chunky sneaker and also to stay puffed I think it just kind of matches this shoe really really well and I think that's why the sneaker community and Ghostbuster Enthusiast sold these out and they flew off shelves everywhere now if you are looking to pick up either of these colorways the slimers are still available in a few sizes I will leave links in the description below and if are any YouTube Affiliates you can check here in the YouTube shop tab to if there's any sizes available but if you are interested in restocks be sure to follow us on X Down Below in the video description and enable post notifications when these restock we send out a notification every single time they do so you can secure a pair for retail and that's not just this pair of sneakers it's all sneakers like the other day we had the $98 Air Jordan one low mochas that just released they sold out super super quick and Nike cut the sale uh quick because they were flying at that price uh but for stuff like that you know just be sure to follow us on X enable post notifications but just in time for the Halloween season I think Puma nailed this one right on the head but let us know your thoughts Down Below in the comments do you think the collection is a cop or a drop and also let us know of the two the Slimer and the state pu which one is your favorite and thank you so much for tuning in to another episode of sneaker huddle and we'll catch you in the very next video n,2025-06-23 14:42:15.660400 UTC

early in the morning and i got a message saying that there was a hundred plus people deep outside of concepts trying to grab them and even the night before out in singapore they had to shut the whole release down outside a foot locker because there was just crowds of people they ended up calling the riot police to disperse everyone but honestly if you asked me a few months ago i would have told you it would have been madness because this is a sneaker that is possibly debated as the best 350 v2 colorway of all time it's a classic it's just a classic when it comes to yeezy sneakers this is as classic as it gets i knew a few months ago when it first got announced this was going to be a tough shoe to get there was some information that was released earlier in the week that got planted in everyone's head and that of course was the stock numbers and i think it threw a lot of people off the 500 000 pairs that was gonna release worldwide but man it was one of the biggest live streams i've ever done shout out to you guys i cannot thank you guys enough so they dropped it i'm talking dick sporting goods finish line jd sports foot locker champs they release yeezys at 7am and that is eastern standard time and for me 7 a.m that is early but i mean you guys out in the west coast 4 a.m so i figured hey you know this is your best chance at picking it up most people are sleeping most people are gonna wake up later on and try to cop on yeezy supply but if you really want this shoe wake up early and that's exactly what happened you know i saw a lot of w's in the chat hitting on dick's sporting goods jd sports finish line i got in within like five minutes of the release on jd sports and i was able to secure my size i was like okay everyone's going to get a pair this is great but then man once these foot sights started to sell out and we crept in later on during the day man oh man yeezy supply they are going to drive me crazy i'll tell you that we tried to cop on youtube i did manage to get through but i got stuck on review and pay once again kicked me out and then i went back to the home screen and i couldn't figure out what to do next and i basically ended up getting blocked and just banned from the site and then of course adidas app kind of saved the day and came in clutch for them for me personally i've struck out on the adidas app later on they ended up doing a restock the foot sights ended up restocking around 11 30 11 45 i ended up getting super lucky i ended up hitting so i ended up getting two pairs really never happens so i will have one pair of rock and one pair to stop hey congrats to everyone who did hit it was a crazy release bots the resellers they all went out for this release and i look over on stockx as far as the resale value it really hasn't gone down that much did come down initially because it was up at a thousand dollars before the drop you know after it dropped it's settling at 430 450 there just wasn't enough pairs to go around i think the demand definitely is a lot higher than the stock the value for this sneaker is just going to go up for me personally if you're going to ask me if this is a sell or a hold if you need the cash now sell it you'll make your money you'll make 400 that's almost double but if you don't really need to sell now definitely hold this is a classic it's not gonna hit a thousand again that day is over but i do think this is gonna hit 550 600 bucks do have a pier right here that we can take a look at i want to give a huge shout out to my friend souls for less make sure you go give him a follow he's got jay balvin's he's got some early yeezys shout out to you bro for you know giving us a pair to take a look at i mean these types of releases right here just get me so excited and the sizing tag on this sneaker just says yeezy boost 350 v2 and then the colorway is core black and red let's take a look at this sneaker man this is just to me this is art right here this is our so a lot of people are going to ask me what's the difference between the 2017 pair and the 2020 pair i do think the knit is a little bit more loose on here i think it's woven a little bit different but other than that there's really no difference one thing did main change is the tag on these comes with rope instead of plastic environmental friendly and more recyclable that's huge with adidas all black primed it upper supply 350 in red there's been some debates on what supply means yay always has a reason behind things i definitely believe there's something behind it people think st pablo loves you i don't really know it has never been confirmed but it definitely means something i would love that the supply 350 come back on the newer silhouettes or like on the newer colorways for 350 v2s i wouldn't mind this design i mean these are just a classic black pull tab on the back so shout out to pull tab gang black pull tab red stitching on the back man these are just simple classic they go with everything this is a 350 v2 that we've seen yay wear nowadays yay don't be wearing 350s he's moved on he's wearing foam runners foam boots he's wearing his military boots now for me personally you're going to ask is this the best 350 v2 of all time i think it's maybe two or three you know if you said this is the best i probably wouldn't debate you on that but for me i am a huge zebra fan this shoe right here will always be number one i think this is the best 350 v2 of all time i don't care how many times they restock it and this is probably second or third now we got the bread restock right it's a shoe that i never thought they would restock what do you guys think or what do you guys want to see restock i know you guys can throw 750s out there or turtle doves or you know oxford tans those ones i don't think they'll restock those but i do think we'll see a restock of another classic 350 v2 in 2021 either belugas the original belugas with the orange stripe i think toads are so fire but i would really like to see the oreos i'd like to see those come back next year in 2021 we'll have to wait and find out i want to hear from you guys down in the comments if you were able to cop or not that is my video for you guys today hopefully you guys enjoyed if you did go ahead and smash that like button for me and subscribe to the channel and like always i'll catch you next

miDOT4Eb20E,Yeezy 350 v2,what's going on everyone my name is roscoe and we are back we're going to be taking a look at the newest v2 now this shoe did release on october 2nd for a retail price of 220 now i like to say thank you to everyone who tuned into the live cop it was a lot of roscoe's chicken and w's being served i felt like if you woke up early you put in the effort you were going to get a pair at retail price but i got a size for you we are gonna do a carbon 350 v2 giveaway how can you win this pair all you got to do smash that like button subscribe to the channel follow me over on instagram and then down in the comments just let me know what sneaker you are looking forward to the most and then just put your instagram handle right next to it and i will pick a winner during the 350 b2 natural stream on october 24th good luck to everybody now let's take a look at the sneakers so it just comes in a regular brown yeezy box now sizing tag for this sneaker i've been getting a lot of messages from you guys you know asking if your pair is legit or is this fake sizing tag for my sneaker says yeezy boost 350 v2 callaway as real adidas and yeezy went back a few weeks ago and changed the name for all the upcoming yeezy sneakers this shoe used to be called ezreal but they changed it to carbon let me know down the comments though if you have the carbon label now let's take a look at this pair of kicks man man i really really like these and here is the carbon 350 v2 first impression man i like these a lot now i like the heavy contrasting a lot of people weren't a fan of that at first they kind of wanted a black soul to match the upper i like the mix up definitely makes the shoe pop a little bit more i think these look incredible on feet i've seen ton of pictures already out there on the internet but what you have is a heavy you know solid base coat prime it a black that's woven throughout the whole shoe and then the second colorway is more of it's like an earth tone blue a little bit of a gray hue in there you see that color below the stripe and then it's also on the medial side as well and then above the black translucent stripe had that same color but it's more dominant so you see that nice earth tone gray blue all throughout that top quadrant and then they added a third color which is just like a regular tone gray that's woven in there as well and also what i've noticed is that there's white primeknit that's woven into the toe box just that little bit right here on the toe box and also on the back of the heel there's like a white primeknit just kind of like woven into that static print but i really like these man they're just different not something that we're used to seeing in the 350 v2 to me made this shoe a little bit more hyped than compared to other 350 v2s like this one doesn't come across as you know another brown tan easy black yeezys always tend to do well so again this one having black being the main colorway of the shoe you knew it was going to do better they added their gray they added that blue and then that of course a heavy contrasting of the soul being not more of like a clear white not like a zebra 350 v2 sole where that one is just super super icy white this one does have a little bit of a yellow tint hue to it which i appreciate because you guys know clear white icy soles do yellow over time and this one already being a little bit of a yellow hue you're not gonna see it that bad i recommend getting drip grip these are premium protection for your soul you slap these clear white grips and it'll just keep it from getting dirty and trashed and then you'll be able to peel them off after a while and they look brand new on the bottom so definitely check out drip grip if you use my code rosco 10 save yourself 10 off on your order but i highly recommend it especially for these clear white soles or anything kind of like this so it also does feature the infinity lacing system so it's back on this i think all 350 v2s from here on out will have this new infinity lacing system it does come with an extra set of laces so just the same color as the one that's dead stock i think the biggest complaint though from a lot of people about this shoe is that no pull tab i don't know what's going on a lot of these new 350 v2s and especially the ones that are coming up don't feature a pull tab hopefully it comes back at some point in 2021 but we've already seen the new colorways that are dropping in february march and april we might not be getting a pull tab on the 350 probably till summer but overall man really nice now as far as resale value for this shoot people were screaming bricks bricks bricks on this shoe when it was coming up for release honestly it's not doing too bad right now it's been like a week since these released and they're right around 275 290 in some sizes and that's pretty good for a shoe that supposedly released 550 000 pairs for a shoe that was pretty easily available i think resale value isn't too bad on it 350 v2s they're not going to be reselling for like 400 500 the day after they release but you're telling me a simple clean silhouette that releases once a month but has resale value of 280 almost 300 that's not bad this shoe is a great investment because i definitely see this shoe sometime next year hitting you know 350 400 this is a really good colorway and it's very popular a lot of people even non-yeezy heads really like this shoe so only see going up in value but these are definitely two of my favorite i feel like the zion's just hit different though man one and two all day long you can pick and choose but these definitely are two of the best 350 v2s carbons just hit different too man well according to stockx the best selling 350 v2 it's still the cinders the cinders are still the best 350 v2 according to stockx as far as sales volume is concerned is refills are amazing fade looks really good the naturals look really good 2020 has been a great year for 350 v2 colorways desert sage it's been a great year it's been a great year for this silhouette but man let me know what you think of the carbon 350 v2 that is my video for you guys today hopefully you guys enjoyed if you did go ahead and smash that like button for me and subscribe to the channel and like always i'll catch you next video,2025-06-23 14:51:47.688240 UTC
0SSHUfgul9g,Yeezy 350 v2,what's going on everyone rasca we are back so today we're gonna be taking a look at the new Yeezy 350 v2 Zion now this sneaker is rumored to be releasing on July 18 for retail price of 220 dollars now you can feel the anticipation in the excitement for this release as this shoe was originally scheduled to release in June but unfortunately it got pushed back to July and we have seen images of this sneaker all over the internet for the past few months and some people are saying that this shoe right here is the best colorway of the 350 v2 for 2020 but before we dive into it all I just want to thank my good friend Souls for less I'll put his Instagram handle right here on the screen make sure you go check him out and give him a follow he's also running a lot of sneaker raffles right now also want to announce that I am doing a giveaway you can win yourself a pair of 350 v2 Zions all you have to do smash that like button subscribe to the channel follow me over on Instagram and then down in the comments just let me know what sneaker you are looking forward to leave your Instagram handle right next to it and also leave your size July 18th when I do the live call I will be buying your size I already have my pair I will be copying your pair live good luck to everybody I'm excited to take a look at this sneaker is this the best colorway let's be honest now this sneaker just comes in a regular easy Bob now sizing for 350 if you've never owned a pair of 350 s I recommend going a half-size up these do run a little bit small and for me personally I always go a half size up so let's take a look at this seeker these are nice this is the new Yeezy 350 v2 Scion and first impression is these are nice these are really really nice biggest complaint I hear we Easy's especially 350 v2s ah they all look the same but this one right here is different base coat color of the primate is a tan you know when used to seen tans I know but the second colorway that the added is this dark brown but it has like a burgundy hue in there I try and really really like add that on the translucent stripe and you also have that second coat right below the translucent stripe and also on the medial side it's in that stitching it is a third colorway in here which is gray you'll see that gray right around the ankle collar and it's also in the stitching here right above the top quadrant now they've been playing with that a lot lately with 350 v2 s you've seen it actually the most drastically on the Y H heels where they added that third red that bright red right above the stripe on this one they kind of went subtle they just did a two-tone the tan and then that gray now the laces is that nice tan but it's not reflective nothing reflects on the shoe besides the three stripes which always happens with these 350 v2 s is on the inside there is no reflective Xion it just comes in this non reflective version I see white sole which I think it looks nice on this shoe but you know I'm not a huge fan of icy white Souls because they do yellow over time so make sure you wear your kicks because you're gonna pull these out of the box one day him the oxidization will turn these all yellow and you'll be like looking at yourself like I'd even wear these so I see white sole and then the bottom they went with more like a light tan for the bottom which looks really nice because it comes up here on the back of the heel one thing I noticed which I think everyone else notices out there too as well the spine of the sneaker they went with a heavy stitch they play a lot with the stitching on these shoes I've seen it with like the desert sage the linens they had a flush look they actually hid the stitch so you can't see it so it's just a flush look to the whole toe box and then I've also seen back in the old statics the black static 3 TV choose from last year there's a heavy not stitch where it stands out this one it's a flushed look but it's heavy stitching I don't want to see a dark gray or like a black it's super noticeable it definitely pops off the sneaker I don't mind it I like that they're changing up a little bit because I feel like these 350 v2s do need like a refreshing look to UM because like that you can notice - they went heavy stitch below the translucent stripe here and then they went heavy stitch on the medial side I really like the medial side of this shoe I think it looks really really nice it definitely has that Turtledove vibe I know a lot of people have been comparing it to the turtle doves over the Internet and I would agree if you're just jumping into the easy game and you weren't around back in 2015 this is a great reminiscence of that time classic first 350 V twos and I know a lot of you guys out there I probably can't afford that sneaker on the secondary market so to have something with that similar vibe man this shoe is awesome is this the best 350 V - for 2020 as of right now yes if you are tired of 350 V twos or you've been picking and choosing which ones to get for this year is ion 350 V 2 is one that you should not pass up on I don't know if it's gonna be my favorite you know we still were halfway through the year then there's a bunch of 350 s on the way today right now this is the front runner and for sure this is a top 3 called away how is this gonna be releasing well I heard the stock number for the shoe is very very high they made a ton of pairs of this shoe makes sense that adidas and Yeezy would make a ton of pairs of this shoe the 350 v2 has to be one of the best unisex shoes on the market a lot of women love this shoe a lot of men love this shoe and when you have a great all-around good colorway then I think it's gonna be you know good with women and good with men it's gonna sell out no matter what they made a ton of pairs of this shoe and I believe it's gonna be dropping everywhere it will be selling at champs Foot Locker finish line all those small foot sites will have them so the boutiques will have them probably you know obviously adidas maybe this wrathful and then also easy supply that's gonna happen as well so this she was gonna be dropping everywhere what does that mean for resale value for the Zion I don't think it's gonna be high after it releases everyone's gonna buy it try to sell it it's gonna it's gonna cut the price lower and lower and lower I think it's gonna be end up at like 275 maybe to 65 but this shoe right here is going to be a great easy to hold long term buy a bunch of pairs leave them in a storage leave them in your closet six months from now they're gonna shoot right off and I think this one could probably end up at 350 400 because you're probably gonna look back on this shoe and say that this is the best 350 for 2020 so that is my video for you guys today good luck to everyone who is going to enter to win yourself a pair of these ions these are really really nice definitely going trait the feet I appreciate everyone for tuning in for today's video if you enjoyed smash that like button subscribe to the channel and I'll catch you in the next video I bet you guys notice I am wearing the new Rosco's 50k subscriber who d been serving a lot of w.zahn the live cops so I want to celebrate we're gonna hit that 50k milestone very soon so I have some new merch available I have hoodies and t-shirts available so here is the logo of the t-shirt very very dope now over 50 K W served that's what we do here on my channel we serve nothing but Roscoe's chicken and dub use,2025-06-23 14:51:48.604853 UTC
nvQEkgreaHw,Air Jordan 1,what's going on guys and welcome back to the channel Today we're taking a first look at the Air Jordan 1 Union LA fragment design collab Before we get into these I want to remind you that this video and all the other content on my channel is for educational and entertainment purposes only If you're new to the channel guys go ahead and like and subscribe for me Really appreciate it It is very very helpful You can also then be sure to follow me on Instagram and Tik Tok at KB Vegas Kicks Guys I appreciate the support and we're going to dive right in these Jordan 1's This one um I have loved all the Union LA Jordan 1's Um this one a little bit different with a like co- collab with Fragment Design Um looking really good Uh I do like it Some things that I would personally have changed on the design but uh let me show you where I picked these up from guys Not a new seller from me but one I have not reviewed for in a while Uh but of course I will have all their information in the description of the video I know they'll take care of you Let's dive right in So you do have that Jordan 1 outsole It is all in this solid rubber compound white Um this is one of the things that I personally would have changed I would have gone with a um contrasted outsole to the midsole but uh the white you know some people say that makes it pop a little bit more sets it apart from the uh traditional Jordan 1 uh fragment So and I can see their point but just personally I would have liked the contrast You don't really see this much on Jordan 1's Um a solid color midsole and outsole Normally there is a contrast but at any rate uh it looks good The midsole in bright white Of course around the medial side you do have your tooling All right And stitching looks good on this pair Um normally when I hold it this way the light will hit and we can kind of see glue residue And this pair looks to be pretty clean from that Always like that pretty good Now as far as the fit and comfort of these shoes um this is the first batch run of these and um this men's 13 fits slightly small in my opinion more like a 12 and 1/2 In fact it's got a size 12 insole in it So um what I would recommend on this one guys is go ahead and asking for your insole measurements on your QC pics just to make sure Um they're not too tight on me for a 13 but not like they're not a true 13 Um so you know just be aware of that Uh they do come with a dream cell insole though so pretty comfortable on foot as far as the cushioning for a Jordan 1 Now the upper of the shoe uh pretty much just kind of like flat grainy leather is going to cover the entire upper of this one You don't there's no tumbled leather or anything like that at least not on this first batch Um but it's soft Nothing to complain about but nothing to write home about either Uh you do have a little bounce back here at the toe box Could be a little bit more sleek on the toe box but it looks nice with that black and white Um you got your perforations of course And then you get three sets of laces Um we'll take a look at that here in a minute I'll show you the different colors But then you have of course your Union LA look to the tongue where you have the stitching uh to the multiple colors You got black and then a sail hit up here Kind of a light blue stitching And then your Nike Air at the top back of the tongue Okay And then black takes care of the sock liner So on the laces um you got black going to uh white you got black going to gray and then you've got white going to black Okay so they all change colors uh midway through the lace Um so you got those three different options on this one guys Let me get that tucked back in if I can with one hand Sorry probably just should have set them down But of course you also have your exposed foam going around the edges of the tongue as expected on this one Uh again just more flat grainy leather all throughout You can see the Union LA tag Not as noticeable on this one Normally it's in that kind of yellowish orange color Uh but it is there And then that kind of light blue stitching also Uh kind of interesting because normally on that you get a contrast from the top of the shoe to the bottom but this kind of looks like the royal design anyway Um whereas normally you'd have like the royal and a different color up top or the you know Chicago and a different color up top Um so this one's a little bit different than your traditional one Got your fragment design pressed in in black There you go Better shot of it Sorry I was getting some glare on there And then the back of the shoes Um don't really have an hourglass shape on this one And you do have double stitching Could be a little bit cleaner but overall it's going to look good on foot And then the medial side Again just a mirror image of the lateral side Everything's the same with the exception of that tooling You see the code there for the fragment design Let's bring in the left one and take a look at it Just more of the same Uh note that the Wings logo does touch this stitching line right there Okay And that is like that on both pairs I didn't mention that before but does touch on both pairs Give you another shot of your Fragment logo And clean stitching all throughout Did a pretty good job on that for sure and the medial side This one again got your tooling and that bright white outsole Again very different for a Jordan 1 bounce back here We already took a look at the laces and then there's your Nike Air again Let me get this light going here and we'll take a look at the strobble on this one So you got the gray Jordan 1 strobal Extra threading tape down Of course you can see all the extra laces in there and then there's your size tag Now inside these came with some cardboard shoe tree inserts And then like we said sorry let me get that light off Dream cell insole You do have that fragment design or excuse me the um Union LA branding on the insole with the Air Jordan And although this marked as a 13 you can see right here it's actually for a size 12 Is a Dream Cell though which is my favorite for Jordan Retro so I'm at least happy about that Um and even though I am a true size 13 when I put these on foot they weren't too tight I mean I could they were noticeably smaller than my uh true size 13s but I can still wear them Maybe not with a crease protector I don't know U but again guys just ask for um your insole measurements Or you can also just ask for them to show you the back side of this Um I'm sure they'll be happy to do that just to make sure cuz my thought is if you go to a size 12 you're going to get the same exact size and everything Then a size 11 on down for some reason at size 13 Sometimes they stop at a size 12 and put a size 13 tag in it Anyway let's set them aside and take a look at the box So you do get the correct uh Union box with all the posters and the sketches from Tinker Hatfield on there Love this box One of my favorite alltime Jordan boxes I think they did a really good job with this one Very creative and looks great I've actually got some on display out here in my studio just cuz I love the box There is your 1985 Air Jordan 1 Of course you got your Nike on the back And then around here is your box label and it's going to be Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG dark powder blue black and white Inside you're going to have that co that uh Union LA tissue paper Uh no other tissue paper or stickers or anything like that Box was well protected in shipping I appreciate that Also came with the uh Jordan Union hang tag Let me show you that real quick Okay so that would have been on the right shoe hanging right there That nice plastic Jumpman and the Union branding with your silver chain of course So yeah all in all looking good Again I probably would have preferred to have a black uh or even a blue uh outsole but other than that they're looking pretty clean I think they did a good job with this one and I'll enjoy rocking them So anyway guys that's my unboxing review this Jordan 1 Union LA Fragment Collab I hope that you enjoyed the review and that it was helpful for you Let me know what you think about this pair in the comments Be sure to follow me on my other socials and be on the lookout guys cuz we got a lot more reviews coming your way,2025-06-19 08:40:09.617864 UTC
knBpSK-42Tc,Vans Old Skool,what's going on guys it's anthony and in this vans old school versus converse all-star video i'll be reviewing and comparing both sneakers to see which one is best for you let's get right into it boys the vans old school and the converse all-stars are iconic sneakers being a classic choice for skateboarding being used in the gym to make them gains as well as being people's go-to sneaker for looking super fly my guy but the question is if i had to choose one which one would i pick and why so that's why in this video i'll be comparing these two sneakers on price quality style fit and durability and at the end i'll give you guys the vert on which one comes out on top and is the one you should buy so let's get started with price the vans old school are going for 60 usd or 80 canadian whereas the converse all-star ox are going for 55 usd or 65 canadian meaning that the converse all-star lows is the more affordable sneaker but are they better we'll have to see let's move on to quality the vans old school has a suede material for the toe box and heel as well as double stitching enhancing the durability at key skate abrasion points and the rest of the uppers are made with canvas material they also have great quality vulcanized waffle grip rubber outsoles for traction on or off the board as well as padded collars for support and extra comfort at the ankles moving on to the converse all-stars the converse all-stars chuck taylors has canvas uppers for a more lightweight and breathable feel with metal eyelets for enhanced durability as well as the white signature rubber toe cap and a great quality vulcanized rubber sole for enhanced strength stability and durability so for quality both sneakers are made with high quality but i definitely like to build on the vans old schools as the suede material gives a more higher quality feel plus the outsoles are definitely better for grip moving on to style the van sneaker has a classic vans old-school silhouette having the iconic jazz strip along the sides with the vans off the wall tag at the back of the shoe the sneaker has a cream insole and a brown outsole plus the extra cushioning around the ankle for more support moving on to the converse sneakers for the converse sneaker it has the low top chuck taylor all-star design with the signature converse logo on the tongue and back of the heel they also have the metal lace eyelets for enhanced durability as well as the signature white rubber toe cap the sneaker has a cream insole and the brown rubber sole like i mentioned before so for style i definitely like the converse all-stars more which is better for more casual or mature outfits which i wear a lot but the style of the vans old school is definitely better if you dress more street or younger and before we move on to fit if you guys are taking in a lot of value make sure you guys are smashing that like button alright let's move on to the fit the vans old school are made to fit wide and they fit true to size they are super comfortable as you're able to walk or skate in them for hours especially with the cushioning on the ankle as they provide a more supportive and secure feel for skating for the converse all-stars low they too are made to fit wide but they fit a half size to a full size smaller so make sure you guys try them on in-store before buying them if possible they also fit very comfortable as you're also able to walk in them for hours or skating them for hours so for fit i'll give the point to the converse all-stars as i like the more relaxed fit better and i don't need the extra ankle support from the vans old school for my lifestyle however the van's old school is definitely better if you skateboard for sure moving on to durability both sneakers are made with high quality materials meaning that they can take a lot of wear and tear and will last a very long time either skate or beater shoe however i'm gonna give the point to the vans old school as they are definitely better when it comes to durability now guys it's time for the final verdict gentlemen both the vans old school and the converse all-stars are amazing sneakers being made with high quality superb styling and enhanced durability and being able to fit a lot of your needs but if you do skateboard i would recommend you to get the vans old school as the extra ankle supports double stitching and padded abrasion points will be very useful for you and for the gym goers you can honestly use either sneaker as they will both support the gains you're making and they're both really great for heavy lifts like deadlifts and squats and for all your style people if you dress more casual or mature the converse all-stars really completes the look and is the one you should buy whereas if you dress more street or younger definitely go for the vans old school as they will match your outfit and guys that's it for this converse all-star vs advanced old school review and comparison and i'll link both sneakers in the description below so you can get them right now it's anthony and i'll catch you guys in the next one peace,2025-06-23 14:38:21.931898 UTC
BQFAukaoLMo,ASICS GEL-LYTE III,what's going on people so this box here has been sitting around for a while now so some of you may have seen the unboxing i did initially like however long ago because i bought these at the same time as those brain dead trebuco's and what else was it the okayama denim gel light threes so however long ago that was somewhere around like the end of last year like october i think yeah these were in that same box they just kind of got forgotten about or whatever but as you see on the side of there that's not going to give away anything but these are the the earth day release right so figure since that's coming around and like in two or three days it kind of makes sense to go ahead and finally knock this review out right so and since if you follow me on the old instagram you probably know that this month april i'm only wearing shoes that i haven't worn yet and so these kind of came to mind oh yeah let me go pull those things out and i got a review first but yeah so i'm pretty sure i didn't see any issues with these before because if i had i probably would have you know swapped them out did that whole return sort of thing or whatever but looks like everything seems to be on the up and up so let's get this turned around here and all that good stuff so let's go ahead and knock this little review out on these right here like i said it is the a6 gel light 3og in a cream and putty colorway also known as earth day there was also a pair of nimbus 23s that i kind of wanted but i have like two pairs of those already so i don't think i needed to add a third pair to the lineup but yeah these right here we're going to talk about these because this is what i have to talk about right down there on the bottom right what you're looking at down there is one of my favorite things a sort of a gum bottom kind of thing going on slightly different color than some of the other ones i've seen in the past but i do like it so there is that let's move on up here to this midsole right so up here what you're looking at pretty much is this cream or putty color whichever one is which i'm guessing that's the cream right because it makes sense to me but anyways simple stuff right not a lot you haven't seen before and then kind of giving you some sign a picture so you can kind of get a good idea of what this shoe overall looks like and all that stuff something a little closer than me right now it says because it's fairly far from the camera you've probably noticed that right that's why i added a lot of pictures kind of helps balance that out anyways let's go ahead and get on into this get this thing moving so down here around like the toe box area you've got like a little bit of a leather sort of thing going on probably not real leather doesn't feel like it would be or anything but that's what's going on and then down in here you got those two little holes or whatever sometimes that's going to be like a 3m situation this time around it is not and then across the upper piece you have the typical mesh style that you tend to have on a lot of shoes of this nature right so all that stuff is pretty much what you're going to see throughout the rest of it for the most part just in different colors and as i was saying here we go moving on to the middle section right a lot of what you saw in the front just in different colors so you've got that asics logo thing that's going to be in i guess putty maybe either way some kind of tannish sort of color and then behind that you've got all the mesh and stuff like i was talking about before and then outlining that whole section you have more of the leather stuff at the top with those tan type block pieces for like where the laces are and all that stuff and then as you move just a little bit past all that stuff back to the rear area so here on the bottom you've got something that kind of reminds me a lot of parts of the svd gel light 3's because it's got this sort of weird thing going on it almost feels like some of that recycle type stuff that you see on various other shoes but anyways you got that going on feels like an old wash rag that's just like way past its prime so there is that and then on the side it says gel light 3 right and then slightly above that you know you've got some of that mesh that kind of extends back and all that good stuff and then to the very back you have more of that recycle type of feel that i was talking about on the bottom because that does wrap around the whole heel and then above that you got the asics and the gel right so nothing you haven't really seen before if you've seen a pair of gel light threes though maybe you haven't seen this pair in particular right but i believe they're still in stock even though this is like an old purchase so you might depend on what size you wear you might still be able to get a pair if these this is something you're into anyways moving back over here to the front right the laces and all that stuff have to check for a second because sometimes these laces can be a little waxy like those i think was the back streets of japan or was it the katamatsu one of those japan related shoes has some waxy laces either way this time around it's not it's just like your standard cotton or whatever this material is that they use on here nothing too special about it but i do like that because i prefer this style overall and it's just going to be in this plain beige's sort of color right even down to the lace tips so moving on past that like i said around that you do have all the leather stuff kind of like you had down here around the toe box area so nothing special like i said the material doesn't feel anything great but you know it's got a decent look i'll give it that but behind there like you have the thing that kind of throws a lot of people off right the whole split tongue thing that they have going on here because if you look on the inside the shoe is kind of like a multi-layered sort of thing in a way like a karachi as i often compare these two so you got that going on right it is pretty comfortable though i do like it it's just the visual may not be for everybody right you know different people different opinions no more stuff so let's move on past that down onto the inside right so down there on the inside what you're looking at in that section is this yellow block and it's got like the asics logo and a sun or something or maybe it's a flower you got something going on in there maybe somebody out there knows what that is because i obviously don't anyways the rest of it is all just kind of whited out for the most part it's mostly white on the insole the interior of the shoe itself is more of that like slightly off-white type of color right slight difference there but that's about it and then as far as if you're curious about like the material how it feels on the inside it feels a little bit softer than this mesh on the outside but it is still just your typical mesh interior that you find on a lot of shoes of this style so there you go that pretty much sums up the overall look of this shoe from the outside so i'm going to get you guys some personal thoughts as to what i think about them and then we'll move on into the sizing and then we'll wrap this up so personally right when i saw these online the color was a little bit different than it appears to be in person right they were a little darker i guess you could say a little closer like a tan sort of color and so when i got these and you may remember if you saw the video i i saw that they were more white and a lot of white and that's not really like a huge thing that i'm into or whatever the thing that i'm huge into or whatever but it's not bad you know it's just it's not what i expected but it's at least different from other things that i have which is good because i don't like to have too much overlap you know as far as presentation so for that reason i'll kind of give it a i'll let it slide or whatever though i do still kind of wish they had looked more along the lines of what i saw online you know it's just that sometimes when you get stuff in person that's when you really know it's kind of like the whole easy situation right those you never know what you're gonna get it's like whatever but it is what it is right so anyways moving on past all that good stuff just kind of taking these for what they are it's another pair of gel light threes and i'm on board with that like right off the top and since it's not like a bad color i can't really complain about it you know it's just a little bit of room for improvement it is what it is though moving along past all that good stuff go ahead and we'll knock out the sizing things that way in case you're curious about how these fit after you listen to this or whatever you won't have to be curious anymore so sizing wise i buy these in a nine and a half because that's the thing that makes sense to me right they're a true to size fit as far as i feel right so i compare these kind of like to an air max 90 i know a lot of people wear those other retro runner type shoes or whatever they kind of feel like that i had a pair of what zero grid 2000s on the other day same sort of situation right so i would say true size if you know what your foot measurement is buy that and you should be okay though there is a decent amount of the population that likes to go up half a size because in some ways they are a slim build but that split tongue thing if it doesn't close all the way that bothers some people right and i totally get that from an aesthetic standpoint so that's another reason a lot of people do go up half a size just to make sure this front area closes up and looks nice and neat right anyways pass all that the shoe as far as like the upper and stuff goes depending on the one that you buy right because not all gel light threes are created equally right some have different materials this kind of one here it's gonna be super breathable which is good if you look like the denim pairs and various other pairs i think even the sbds not as breathable as these so if you're looking at a pair of these right don't treat them all the same do some close-up research and see what's really going on before you jump into that but your standard one the average gel light 3 super breathable very comfortable so there is that speaking of the bottom here this midsole section right that while nothing amazing by today's standards has held up pretty well over the last what 30 years i want to say these came out in 90. so much like other air maxes and stuff that i have referred to through this video and other things like the zx 8000's and stuff like that from adidas these are just fine like you're going to be good wearing these all day long doing whatever it is you do with your life during the day right so i can easily suggest these to anybody and they come in a bunch of colors that being that there's not a whole lot else to really cover with these so i can get this whole thing wrapped up though one one thing that i do want to throw in there i was just saying that these are a good pick and all that good stuff because they're comfortable in lots of colors the other kicker to that is like they're super cheap and generally super available right so you don't have to jump through tuning in oops to get a pair if you want a pair and whatever color you happen to be into you can probably find them and from what i've seen like i'm saying how these are still mostly in stock yeah like they tend to hang around for like a long time so you don't need to like jump on them immediately you know you got some weeks maybe even months in a lot of cases to kind of figure out which pair is right for you you know i don't see them in a lot of stores though which is uh maybe it's just where i live though i don't know do you guys see these like gel like threes in stores outside of like maybe an asic store but i'm saying like foot lockers and chances and whatnot and well i would say foot action but apparently those are gone now which is unfortunate anyways that's going to be that pretty much for now i do have a couple shirts that i'm going to open up here use this knife that dx bought me but if you want to leave like you can totally leave because you know the shoe part is done this i just have some running shirts because that's the thing i buy a lot of if you saw that live i did last night and that whole debacle towards the end i know what i'm talking about what's weird to me though is like these right here i fought them all from asics same day same big order they shipped at the same time arrived on at the same time but they packaged them well they packaged this one separately from the others i kind of like some colorful things every so often right so i saw this one and i was like yeah let's do that why not let's see what this thing's all about kind of reminds me like a like is it sprite i think sprite is this color maybe something's that color mountain dew i'm going to i'm going to go back and stick a sprite you know they say you're not supposed to change your first answer you know that's the thing i actually hear about testing and stuff so i mean unless you don't read the whole question then sometimes you want to change that first answer all right see what all i bought because this order was like two weeks ago or something so you know i don't want to remember what stuff is so i got us a red one here do like these things they're also good for working out you know just because it's like super lightweight and stuff so i do like that even past the running situation but i have two pairs of asics running shoes that i want to break in through this month so that's why i kind of needed some extra shirts or whatever you know this one this one feels a little heavier than i would like it to feel but i like that color so i don't know it's it's a toss up you know how to feel about that this had that thing to know that for a second the back that looked like this trail shirt that i bought from nike it has like a pocket on the back like up in the top between your shoulder blades it's weird we don't know what they're doing with that and this one same style just different color so there you go cool got a couple of those we'll be breaking those out in the next couple weeks or something like that from me to you have a nice rest of your day or rest your night whatever it is wherever you are i will likely be going live again tonight but of course as i always say by the time you hear me say that that live will have happened already because this video is not set to go up until friday i think friday's earth day whatever later people,2025-06-23 14:47:24.236915 UTC
bGrSmmn3b2s,Stan Smith,what's going on you guys - Barroso welcome to my channel yeah I know this time so for today's video I decided to change things up just a little bit and actually talk about one of the things that I absolutely love her style is actually juice so one of the shoes that I'm gonna be starting off with and well I guess you want to call them sneakers I usually say shoes I don't know why one of the shoes that I'm gonna be talking about in today's video as you might know since you read the title the adidas Stan Smith and just real quick if you're new to this channel please hit that subscribe button where I release new videos every week I give you guys more outfit inspiration and you can follow me on my Instagram at I'm Byron Orozco be sure to follow me on instagram and without further ado let's just talk about this beauty of a shoe that's Dan Smith now if you were to ask me what white sneakers should I start off wearing what do you recommend what is like the best to start off with well it's always gonna be the idea Stan Smith without a doubt and by the way this was actually my first Marisol yeah I stuck with this all up now just a little bit of a history behind this shoe it actually came out in 1965 and the Beatles were trying to look for a tennis athlete to promote the shoe and that's when they came across with Stan Smith who was a amazing tennis player winning 37 career single titles and 50 double crowns I don't know what that really means but damn that's pretty good I guess and you started wearing them in 1971 and actually became the number one tennis player in the world so this is gonna be like for today's video like both things so my experience with the shoe and basically like a review and also what I think you guys should be wearing when you wearing the shoe just to match your outfits and fit that fashion vibe so the first thing is to start off with the pro I mean it's really versatile as a leather quality on top it's actually really affordable you can find them on sale sometimes you just gotta be looking they could be up to like $50 on sale but the maximum price will be like 80 85 ish you really gotta do your research and just find like the perfect price book because they're really not that expensive in in my personal opinion I just think that they're timeless like they can just go on for like years and years and they're just so good and as for cons I mean there really isn't any like in my personal opinion but like the only thing I would complain about is that they mostly fall into the best fashion but but the thing is that it's just so Chris how I'm so good like you really can't complain that much about it however they're really not that high-end sneaker if you know what I'm talking about like the other expensive pair that you see other people wear but seriously though the Stan Smith's are very versatile too like any outfit that you put I mean look what I wore with this suit I mean it's just so versatile and they're just so great you know they can just use with anything really now going into the outfits really I mean you could basically use it with anything again they're versatile I use them in my casual looks street wear looks and formal looks which you guys know I've already used them in my past videos so if you would like to check them out the links are gonna be down in the description and one last thing the most important of all please guys keep them clean you're gonna look so much better just keeping them crispy white and clean like really those girls are definitely gonna notice I swear they look down are you beat and I've gotten a lot of compliments from just how great they look and trust me they're gonna notice that and that's a good thing and this video isn't sponsored by the way I mean well I wished it was bothered and that guy is like really though I mean as your first pair of white sneakers that plane get the idea since man thank you guys so much for watching I hope enjoy the video make sure you hit that like button subscribe if you're new all that's up for now I'll see you all the next video and I hope you all have a great day yourself,2025-06-19 08:39:28.040817 UTC
Y_i8W4Ke4vQ,Nike Dunk Panda,what's going on youtube fam today i want to give you guys a quick look at your black and white nike dunk lows uh before i go over the kicks and get into the review if you

let me know that you guys like the video like the content and just make me want to keep sharing my pickups with you guys so hit that thumbs up button for me too while you're at it so now that all that intro stuff is out of the way let's go ahead and we can dive right into these uh so this is the latest colorway or one of the latest colorways of the nike dunk lows they've been dropping a lot of different colorways and seemed like you know nike saw that it was a hit last year in 2020 so they just starting to kind of hammer us and drop a lot of colors of nike dunks the sad thing is you know not at nike see that there's that demand form i feel like they kind of been shot changing us on quality and if you look on here like this the the material that they used on here is like plastic pretty much it's a real cheap cheap synthetic grain of leather on his it's not really uh not soft or tumbled it's like a really cheap grain of uh of leather last year's dunks were way better to me and for the same price point feel like they're just you know trying to capitalize now that that demand is there they could kind of shortchange us on on leather quality but it's still a dope colorway dope shoe and i guess for a hundred bucks you can't really complain too much which sucks because 100 bucks is still a lot of money um you know you spend your money you want to be able to get some nice quality leather at least but we just don't get that with nike and it's time to just you know stop beating that dead horse we won't get anything good from them another thing that they also changed like on all of them i noticed that they went with these different style laces kind of like a nylon material it's a weird material it's not your traditional style lace we've been getting in nike dunks and we don't have uh extra set of laces so with the dunks in 20 20 we at least were getting some some uh extra laces if you wanted to change the laces out you got to change them to different colors or something but um they haven't really been doing that with the 2021 releases for some reason uh but like i said these are probably the the simplest and cleanest and easiest to wear pair that has released so far uh you know it's just that they just been really hard to get especially low tops not sure why the lows are more sought after than the dunk highs uh seem like you can get dunk highs on a resale uh market for you know almost close to retail price but with the lows seem like you're gonna spend a little bit more money if you're trying to get uh nike dunk low so material like i said it's okay quality quality wise there was some glue stains on here also uh these aren't as bad as some of my other dunks just some minor glue stains on here won't be anything noticeable like once i put these on feet you won't really be able to tell too too much with the glue stains that i've seen on here it's not too bad but it's still you know kind of expected at this point with nike you don't always get a1 quality but uh this is pretty much it for the kicks i'm gonna show you guys the box in a second i'm gonna also toss them on feet towards the end of the video go over sizing and comfort and all that stuff so if you're curious to know about that stuff just hang tight until the end of the video or you could go ahead and just fast forward to the end of the video so these are the kicks guys let me show you guys the box really quick so coming over here you got the regular flip open style nike box that we've been getting uh no extras or anything like i mentioned no tissue i mean no uh laces or anything nothing that came with them um here is the the box this is your box label color breakdown product code like i mentioned retail was just a hundred bucks uh something that i would think would be cool like this qc code if you scan that it's just been opening up the regular nikes app i think you know nike would be a game changer if you can scan that and the actual shoe that's inside the box will pop up on your phone so for people like myself who have a ton of shoes and stacked up and i don't really do the drop fronts you know i could scan it and know what's in the box quickly uh you know without kind of read the color code and breakdown and trying to figure out what's in the box but right now it's just you scan that and just open the nike's app so i'm not sure why we have that so that's the box guys show you guys the kicks one last time um so before before i put them on feet man y'all go ahead leave me a comment down at the bottom let me know what you think of the nike dunks all together uh compared to last releases and this year's releases and just how hard they are now and um are you even a fan of dunks or you just kind of feel like it's a it's a trend it's gonna eventually die down like it did because dunks weren't hot for a while you know seem like all of a sudden it's just a wave that everybody's on so give me leave me a comment let me know what you think about the whole nike dunk game and everything right now so uh here you go i'm gonna take them off here now i'm gonna show you guys what these look like laced up in our feet you guys hang tight one second all right guys so here's an on feet look at the nike dunk low your black and white colorway i just want to show you guys what they look like really quick on feet so first things first i'll go over sizing to me these fit like your dunks has been running and they kind of feel like a jordan one to me also and that's i go down a half size in my regular dunks but nike dunk sb's i usually go true to size and nose just because the sb's they have a little bit more padding around the ankle and the tongue area and i feel like those fit a little bit more snug and exact so i think you go true to size and regular s beads but far as these like your regular dunks if you like a snug fit like i do i think you could go down a half size and i have a medium to narrow with foot and i'm i'm perfectly fine with going down a half size if you don't like a snug fit and you want like a little bit of room go through the size and i think you'll be okay if you have wide feet and you like a snug fit go true to size and i think that'll be the move for you but if you have wide feet and you like a little bit of room you might want to consider going up a half size so as far as comfort goes on these the dunks are technology from the 80s and it hasn't changed much since then uh meaning you know you don't have any of that up-to-date technology and comfort in there no real squish or bounce or cushioning it's a really really flat shoe but it's a comfortable shoe that i feel you could casually wear all day long and not be in any pain um i think these you know they're dope and like i said this is probably one of the most easiest colors to wear black and white just goes with with anything you can throw these on anything and uh pull outfit together so uh here you guys go man we'll keep you long just wanna show you one last look show you what they look like on feet um i have more videos on the way more material and all that stuff headed you guys wait so as i mentioned earlier if you are new hit that subscribe button click that notification bell and i will see you guys on the next video all right y'all stay tuned all right guys peace you,2025-06-23 14:49:36.186543 UTC

to be their most popular Sneakers but then last year by far one of the most popular colle collabs of the year were the emond door collab on the 550s they originally released these shoes in four colorways four absolutely beautiful super clean colorways and this collab really had everyone talking in the sneaker world it was a shoe that nobody was really familiar with and it definitely surprised a few people including myself because I always definitely thought of New Balance as that Dad shoe company so to see a new balance logo on such a versatille looking everyday pair type of shoe it was a very pleasant surprise and everyone wanted those shoes those Al pairs were going for ridiculous amounts on the sneaker resale Market New Balance saw how popular the shoe was and they have released a lot of color waves over the last year I've CED several for myself I have this green pair I also cop this regular sea salt colorway a nice black and white pair also this white and gray pair you see right here I've been scooping up as many colorways as I can myself because I just can't seem to find a colorway that looks bad on this shoe and new balance is constant L releasing new colorways I will leave that link in the description to the New Balance website make sure you guys click that link and check out what is in stock right now because of how popular the shoe has been it's actually been quite hard to get the sneaker for retail even though this is a general release shoe but the good news is no matter what colorway you throw on here the sneaker just always seems to look good so hopefully you guys are all able to get a pair the retail price of this sneaker is $110 some special edition pairs like the ALDS they go for AIG bit higher than that for $110 these are definitely a steal especially when you consider what some of these other sneakers are going for retail price nowadays like Jordans and Yeezys the retail price of this sneaker makes it comparable with some of the mainline releasees some other brands such as the Nike Dunk low and also the Adidas Forum Low's these sneakers have a nice retro look to them and they do not look out of place whatsoever today with the sneaker New Balance seems to have finally created that mainstream sneaker that appeals to everyone it seems seems like all of the big brands have that for example the Air Force Ones Stan Smiths we never really had that type of shoe from New Balance but now with these this is a sneaker that people who have never worn any new balances before they could see themselves wearing a pair like this because it is just a very clean and wearable shoe getting into the quality of the shoe the leather is definitely quite nice on these the leather on these I would say is better than some of the leather we see on most of the mainstream sneakers out there right now in the same price range it's definitely better than a Nike D and probably even better than the Stan Smiths maybe not as good as the other basketball sneakers from Adidas The Forum Lowe's the leather on those slightly better but you're still getting pretty decent quality for $110 with this shoe on some pairs like this pair I have right here this is the team green colorway you do see some suede on the toe area not all the pairs have these most of the pairs in fact have a leather toe cap the suede even though it isn't the best suede it's nice to see additional materials used on the shoe the leather is also Al perforated along the upper to provide a bit more breathability and you also got some bits of mesh at the back of the shoe and another thing I like about the shoe a lot definitely has to be the Comfort these sneakers do come with ortholite insoles which really make all the difference I wore these sneakers on a recent trip I did to Paris and on some of those days on the trip I literally walked 30,000 steps in these shoes my feet were totally fine they weren't killing me so you can actually walk around all day in these without your feet hurt too much which is definitely not what you can say about most other sneakers in that price range so I got to give this sneaker pretty high marks of comfort now let's talk about sizing this is probably the most important thing for you guys to know if there's one slightly negative thing I will say about the sneaker is that the sizing is a bit weird I go true to sizing these and I will say I do feel a bit of heel slippage at the back of the shoe and this was something I noticed when I got my first pair of 550s so I did try to go a half size down and future pairs just to test it out and I will say that's probably not the right idea because I still felt the same amount of heel slippage even though I went half a size down however the toe box and the mid panels of the shoe just felt a lot tighter so personally I prefer to stick with true to size in these my suggestion is to go true to size make sure you get your laces nice and tight I personally found half size down to be pretty uncomfortable for comparison sakes for those of you who wear other New Balances like the 990s or 992s I go a half size size down in those shoes with these I prefer to go true to size so I wear the same size in these as I wear in Nike Dunks and also Air Max sneakers if you're able to try these on before buying yeah I would say try a half size down and a true to size pair just to see what fits right for you but if you're not able to personally I suggest going through the size that fits the best going to end off this video by giving you guys some on feet looks I tried on this sneaker with different types of pants it got some joggers in here jeans some corduroys also threw in some loose fitting pants as well just to show you guys that these sneakers really do go with everything but before you watch that make sure you guys are subscribed to the channel if you're into this type of content and also follow me on Instagram the handle is right here at JD kick6 definitely the best place to contact me and I will see you guys next time peace Jay did it",2025-06-23 14:50:45.229626 UTC
dyDWJ4hBFPw,ASICS GEL-LYTE III,what's good YouTube it's your boy taste makers palette back at it again with another review hope that you are all well um bringing you another sneaker review been kind of in my as6 bag and um A6 New Balance uh bag and um you know wanted to um bring something foundational um in terms of of the A6 brand um if if you uh have not checked out my other as6 reviews um the GT 2160 and uh gel 1130 please uh check those out um but during those reviews I mentioned kind of my personal history with A6 and when I was first introduced to ASX when I started wearing them and I say my first pair was probably around uh maybe 2000 in that some somewhere in that time frame and uh they'd always been on the radar but that was probably around the first time where I felt that um their their aesthetic fit into into my style where I would actually pull a trigger and grab a pair and the F the very first pair that I bought um was the um was the gel 3 A6 gel 3 OG right after that I bought the I picked up a couple of pair of like the flatter on onitu tigers um I don't know what the what the model was I have to do some research and bring that back up those were pretty cool they were like a flat plain sneaker almost like a like a like an Adidas Samba or something like that but the gel the gel 3 OG was more kind of like what I was used to at the time like the Track Running jogger um it kind of reminds me silhouette wise of maybe like an Air Max One without a bubble um but the the the very unique thing about it was the tongue it had this kind of split split tongue type thing and um the funny thing is when I think about asex I think about Japanese kind of style and and things like that and and that the tongue kind of fit what I what I imagine um you know that that that aesthetic to be um so pretty pretty dope so I picked up a pair and I'm going to review them with you today and let's let's take a look um I've been carousing the A6 site and I I ran across these they were the very last pair and they just so happen to have a pair in my size um and they were they were on sale so um so here we have it the A6 uh 3 OG gel 3 OG um you know it's this is this is kind of a a really really exaggerated colorway this kind of uh metallic silver and pink and gray with with the white um you can find them in in like there's like so many different colorways some some are a little bit more laidback than this this is a definitely a more standout pair but um you know a dope a dope look you know like with a plain gray jogging suit or you know um you know there's ton of different ways to flip this jeans and a sweatshirt or whatever the case may be jeans in a butt up you know um just kind of that that classic um jogger um the gel 3 OG I think it was originally re released in 1990 so you see that plain that plain style here um just to get into some of the details it's mostly mesh with some synthetic leather overlays throughout there's uh the synthetic um leather overlay that surrounds the eyelets and then there's a little bit of of suede like a very small amount of suede here then you have the A6 sign and this uh synthetic silver overlay with a pink kind of highlight in the middle then there's this kind of metallic uh kind of uh material on the heel cup you have your gel light uh branding here um says standard sole uh that old school kind of running shoe traction on the bottom um that same kind of metallic gray silverish overlay in the front with some design there very nice um but what I was mentioning in terms of that tongue there you see that split tongue it doesn't have the normal tongue that you pull out it's just this kind of split type uh type deal here and I really I really like that the only thing about it is that and you'll see when I try it on is that I can it's it's so hard to get it to close flush so some of the sock is sometimes exposed that's a uh you know that's a a first world problem there I mean it's not a it's not a major issue but um it does kind of get on my nerves I would like for it to kind of look exactly like like it looks here on my foot and but it winds up looking a little bit like that sometimes and that bothers me just a little bit um but this this is a a wonderful wonderful shoe to have in your collection um I think they retail for around like a hundred bucks or so I picked this pair up for 40 bucks they were $ 39.95 on the A6 side but again it was the very last pair one pair left in my size so I just went ahead and picked them up and and and grabbed them I said it would be a great shoe to have um you know on deck in the collection just to pull out a crispy pair of Runners and also a dope shoe to review um it deserves it's spot in history in the A6 lineup um this is this is one of the trailblazing shoes that I remember seeing a lot of people wear going way back in the day when A6 was really really popular so um shout out to this this gel light 3 OG um so yeah I'll go ahead and try them on so you guys get a feel of what they look like on foot I know I'm go I'm going in in with the as6 um I I actually there's a couple of other ones that I have uh that I have to I feel like I almost have to pick up um there's the uh the gel NYC and then there's the Cayo 14s so as I pick those up you'll see the review for those so stay tuned what I'm not in here is that in order to get that the tongue kind of flush like I was mentioning the secret might be to to just wear a thin pair of socks so that's what I'm seeing here cuz I I I threw them on the other day and they were flush and I had on I had on my work socks which are just like some Thin um business kind of socks you know what I mean so now now I've got on a pair of athletic socks and then not it's not closing like it closed before so uh giving me a little bit of OCD anxiety but no sweat figure it out I'm trying to avoid uh tying them up super tight like straight jacket shoes all right don't want to choke the feet up all right so let's take a look and see what they look like on foot I'm going bring you down excuse the floor this is what we got here and yeah man just a really really dope pair of shoes um another thing to consider in terms of the the way the uh tongue fits you don't if you're the type of person that likes to have that the bottom of your pants or the cup of your pants sit behind the tongue you won't get that you won't be able to accomplish that look so these are these are kind of Ideal for the for the athletic joggers with the cuffed ankles um I'm seeing a lot of a lot of baggy joggers with wide bottoms that those will be a good look too because those will kind of sit over the front of the shoe um but if you have just that kind of uh that perfect opening at the bottom of the cuff and you want to sit those um sit your jeans behind the tongue this is that'll be hard to do with these but this is what these look like man you guys let me know what you think I think these are a really really dope look um shout out to as6 he's you know there for giving us something something alternative to to rock with aside from just the the same old Nike or the New Balance crave that where everybody seems to be on now so let me know what you guys think like comment subscribe subscribe comment like taste makers palette I'm bringing you bringing you uh all of my pickups um till the next time tast makers palette we're out,2025-06-23 14:47:22.281280 UTC
EeY2CCCL6W0,Adidas Gazelle,what's good everybody my name is tyler chevy i'm here to review the adidas gazelle adv all right overall construction of the shoe vulcanized build it's got the hex flex sole which is very grippy i like it so far and then you got the addie tuff underneath the suede so after you blow through that you got some rubber to go through as well keep it rolling so the shoe is pretty light overall which i like it's not quad hopping around your foot the tongue does not have any bands to keep you in but honestly it doesn't really move around that much insole as well let me pop this baby out this is the adiprene insole it's pretty thin it's got a little cush doesn't feel too bad the shoe overall is pretty thin so if you like to jump down stuff it's not necessarily the best maybe get another insole for there dr scholl's footprint anything will run but also if you don't like high impact stuff 10 stairs rails triple kinks and your manual guy like me this shoe is very nice it's very nice on your foot you can get tech you can flick stuff feels good got a nice bend another thing i like is that the heel cup has got these pads on the inner side so when you put it on it kind of sucks your heel in so when you bend up on your toe you don't feel that heel gap which is really nice because nobody likes sloppy shoes when i tried on the first one i usually wear nine and a half's so they're running pretty big i tried the nine still a little big went to the eight and a half which is super rare for me and they're a little tight but i kind of like that because stretch them out a little bit and they're just like nice and formed to your foot so it's feeling pretty good after 20 30 minutes of skating after session one just a little scuff on the toe and we're looking pretty good i'll keep skating in for a couple more weeks and come back to you guys with more input what's up everybody i'm back with the update it's been about three weeks i really like the shoe a few things that i want to point out uh first thing no ripped laces which is really nice i tend to rip my laces on pretty much every single shoe another thing is the ollie pad i definitely blow that out on every single shoe the stripe took me about a couple days to blow through but you got all this addy tough underneath and the ollie pad still holding strong i purposely didn't shoe gu to see how long it would last we got the threading on the toe it's starting to come undone a little bit but it hasn't started to split the shoe has held its form very nicely it doesn't feel just like a piece of cloth over your toes or anything like that as far as the tread goes it's held in pretty nicely i definitely like to stop with my heels and i'll blow those out but pretty much like nothing ever happened dude three weeks in it's pretty chill the shoe doesn't have very much breathability in there i get super sweaty feet doesn't really have any like extra eyelet holes or anything on the side like that as far as the sole goes it's not the best the heel is kind of packed out the front kind of stayed true doesn't provide very much impact protection i don't jump down stuff very often but it hurts all right so with this shoe i went down a full size which was honestly a little too much for me but i kind of stretched it out after a couple days it did hurt my toes i would definitely recommend going down a half size unless you like your stuff really snug then don't go the full size once again this is tyler chevy reviewing the adidas gazelle adv if you guys got any questions feel free to drop a comment in the box below or you can go check them out yourself in store at tactics,2025-06-23 14:38:59.166427 UTC
QfQvIPNLwls,New Balance 2002R,what's good family welcome to another video hope you're all doing well today I'm going to review my latest purchase the 2002 are New Balances I've never really had New Balances this is actually my first pair I went for the black colorway with the white sole so I thought let me wear this next couple days see how it goes and it's been about five to six days now I'm gonna review this and I'll be going through the size the comfort and how they're actually worth buying and was it a mistake of me getting this or should I just no maybe now look into something like these now or you know if they actually you know that good because a lot of people are saying online that yeah these are very comfortable so I'll tell you anything in this video of what I've found so far right in terms of the size recommendation let's just jump into that first I think you can go through the size you definitely wouldn't have a problem with that as long as you are comfortable having you know wearing one layer of socks because I know there are people out there who do like wearing two little socks in the winter because they're quite cold and you do like to layer up a little bit um then I would say go probably half a size up but you should be okay with true to size and I am actually very comfortable wearing this in my tutor size I don't really have an issue of her because of the front of the shoe over here it's um it's not too hard it's quite soft so even if a studio size I don't have the issue with mine because I have wide feet so it doesn't have an issue with my feet becoming sore over hours and I was wearing them with this you know when we're going through the sides so I'm not okay with it you should be as well but if you have stock which is true to size in general with other pair of training of a brand you shouldn't have a problem as well with this now in terms of the price point we're looking at 140 pounds over here so it's around reason try some places are doing 130 pounds somewhere under 40 pounds if you have a student discount guys please use it because you can get 10 off and if you do know someone working in stores that will always help because they can give you up to 25 20 how much of a discount they get start off discount they can use that and yeah you can get it for a little bit less guys let's talk about Comfort this is by far one of the most comfortable shoes I've ever worn easy hands down my Jordans my dunks my other trainers that I have they're not that comfortable even my designer pairs that have the balenciagara runners they're nice but they are not comfortable I cannot wear those to shoes for hours and hours and expect to the comfortable no whereas these yes I can they're out there to compete with my Yeezys my 350s definitely with them like up there in terms of comfort level but yeah guys it's amazing like I was shocked like I've never go there and just buy it on the sport that's just not me I like taking my time when it comes to trainers and I am looking to now invest more into this this brand I get even more colors because I think I can definitely drop more colors there this nice gray color that said that was the other day it's still got this nice like a gel kind of it's that effectively like I don't know what this is inside the soul I could be wrong it could be not it could not be a joke it could be something in there that absorbs that have some kind of shock absorbers but guys it's so comfortable the sole itself the moment you put this in you don't have to go half the size up you don't have to go on full size up you don't have to compromise with the size you can wear this with true designs and be comfortable all day long and you can yeah yeah definitely yeah um enjoy wearing them so yeah guys that's it for today hope you will enjoy the video this review as well and let me know in the comments do you have a pair of this are they comfortable do you like them are you looking to get more pairs or are you looking at you by for the first time just like I did as well a few days ago I mean for me I definitely recommend it for my side that yeah guys you will not have an issue I'm very confident that the moment you wear this try this on you will buy it it's just that good this is one issue I would say I haven't really highlighted this in this video and that's the suede on this I I think it just kind of if you get a mark on it then it starts to kind of wear out very quickly but I think you can easily clean it with a cloth and it shouldn't have an issue and when you had it five or six days but other than that no complaints um so far all good and uh yeah that's that's it for the video today and until next time have a nice day peace,2025-06-23 14:45:46.640240 UTC
s5o7d_mjYAU,Yeezy 350 v2,what's good youtube it's your boy tony d2 wild checking in once again back with the back of the day guys on the review of the upcoming yeezy 350 v2 slate a yeezy 350v2 it's been a long time coming i mean i don't know the last time i i need to check when is the last time i've done a yeezy review it's it might have been a year looking at it right now the closest thing to a review was my yeezy uh nsldtd the boots i got them and i think i did like a little review on it but a full-fledged on review bruh it's been almost two years i want to say the last one i did was the easy 500. i picked up yeezys don't get me wrong but a full in-depth review i feel like it's been a long time coming and today we have the yeezy 350 v2 in the slate colorway and these are set to release this upcoming weekend september 10th for a retail price point of 230 dollars the quality magnificent with that pillow soft pancake patty melt popping on that handstand material when it comes to the easy 350v2 you already know what time it is i love the slate i love well let me read the actual color it says slate slash black slash slate we have that sply 350 stripe on the side that we known to love when it comes to the v2 no pull tab on the back and pretty standard and nice to go i want to say these look a lot similar to that of the easy 350v2 landmark which is one of my favorite out there but i'm going to be off i'm going to go off the record and say right now just straight off the rip that these are the best yeezy release well yeah so far this year now turtle doves have released this year i know it's a restock but i'm just saying like as far as 350 v2s this is the best one that has released so far this is the one actually made me go out and want to have and actually keep like i plan on keeping these in the collection because i haven't been picking up v2s or any 350s in a very long time now as far as overall release yes the turtle dub can come in and fight it but it's a restock and i don't tend to always call restocks like best releases but i guess it's not even a restock so i'll still give it to the turtle dove but i still think that this is one of the top if not this is the best 350 v2 that dropped this year but it's pretty much standard like any yeezy v2 out there but i want to say over the years the sizing i feel like has kind of slightly went down this is a size 8 and a half and it is very very snug snug to wear i wouldn't have mined a nine i'm cool with the size eight and a half that it came with but i definitely will have to break this one in that slate colorway the best way to describe it it's kind of a grayish brown when it comes to that it's more so on the gray but it has this hint of a brown almost to it it's more let me just show you i have here a blanket this blanket is straight up brown and then this is it so they're very very close you feel me it's hard to tell the difference but it is more of a gray and it has this little tint of brown in it the stripe on the side that's the straight up black it i don't the slate when it comes to slate i want to say the last shoe that i reviewed was the easy 500 slate but that was a navy blue color so this slate color has been used and interchanged with other type of colors in the past resembling that of you know a blue or i've seen slate be black i've seen slate be like oh great i've seen slate b other colors out there but hey to each own i think this is a very nice colorway and i think these are going to do very well as well once again that boost on the feet there is some slight changes like this little globe i never seen that on yeezys i've seen this typical right here on the inside but this is a little bit something different that uh i'm just now getting used to like i said it's been a minute since i picked up a pair i want to say the last pair of 350 v2s that i actually picked up b2s v2s were the carbons i did pick up a pair of 450s i've copped a couple of yeezy slides recently but this right here the dundata the v2 one of the most iconic if not most reproduced yeezy out there this is a very dope colorway these are releasing in a full family size run so if you're trying to get your family out there make sure you get that on deck because it's definitely going to be something that the whole family holes should mow in this whole the whole everybody can get their damn pair and rock them in the building but yeah man very simple very uh nice very uh i would say neutral that can go with pretty much any type of clothing or anything out there i rocked them in some shorts with the new socks by the way those socks i showed you all the sample socks they are available now the link will be down below in the description i'll rock them with the adidas pants you'll see it all in their own foot and they pretty much they run well they look well with any pretty much any type of jean any type of color you can do your thug bit there's a way you see i got the yeezy t on deck too you feel me but yeah man be on the lookout these drop this upcoming weekend let me know you guys thoughts and opinions down below in the comment section if you're going to cop these if you're not i would love to hear it and i will see y'all on the next video i'm gonna end y'all off with that on foot and i got some bangers coming man i'm just getting these reviews out the way we got a lot

2Rpm6b9I9Yw,Nike Cortez,what's good youtube this your boy finesse got j diggy 92 coming back at y'all with uh i don't know what we call in this review on feet reaction type deal i haven't came up with a good name for it yet so just just roll with me um but now we coming back at y'all with another on feet reaction review whatever um of the nike cortez the classic black and white jones um make sure y'all hit that thumbs up and that like button for me this shoe is clean probably one of my favorite models for 2020 and probably going into 21 in all honesty so let's get smacked to the review and then i'll get you all up out of here cool cool all right so starting off the nike cortez classics man it don't get much much cleaner than this y'all um as far as sizing goes i wear a size 12 in nike products in cortez's i have to wear 12 and a half it is mandatory you go up a half a size from your regular nike size that is to anybody wide foot or narrow foot if i cannot get a 12 and a half i am buying a 13 i can't even fade a size 12. that will leave your foot screaming trust me on this one these shoes are comfortable as hell but if you do not get the right size you are paying the price for no matter if you lace yours up like i have mine here or you wear them loose it don't matter your still gonna be screaming so please go up half a size um like i said as far as comfort um scaling one to ten i give them an eight they are clean it takes a i ain't gonna say it takes a while to break in but it does take a few wears um doing these on feet videos i got to see the comfort develop over time um each time i try them on and it just seems like it got better and better and better so cortez are very comfortable that's why they got an eight out of ten um only thing keeping them from that is you have to go up a half a size because the shoe is very very narrow um as far as like styling and fit is concerned um they're classic shoes so you really can wear these with anything um i know these using more like a la west coast style to where they're wearing like the high socks and cargo shorts and things like that but i feel like they look good with everything personally i like wearing these with cargo pants um the ones with the this drawstring at the bottom or without it i feel like they look good with everything so hey man i love cortez's um i'm kind of biased when they come to it so if y'all got any more questions or comments leave them down in the um comment section below and i'll get back with y'all and uh yeah let me know how y'all feeling if you are vibing with this new on feet type of review um and yeah man i love y'all thank you for watching and like i always say i will see y'all when i see y'all enjoy the rest of this on feet peace jaws music music,2025-06-23 11:22:09.085083 UTC
9Ywvk9APHeo,Nike Dunk Panda,what's good youtube welcome back to the channel jd here with yet another video for you guys sustainability so that has become a very important topic in the sneaker world recently that is why nike started the move to xero campaign which is nike's mission to move towards zero carbon emissions and zero waste this includes using sustainable materials in the production of their sneakers and in this video i'm going to be talking about nike's latest effort to make a sustainable sneaker and this might be their most popular one i will be reviewing the nike dunk low black white or panda next nature so what's good guys to all my long-term viewers welcome back to the channel and if you are new here my name is josh and i make sneaker content sneaker reviews how to style sneakers all of that stuff if you are into that type of content make sure you hit that subscribe button i am dropping at least three videos a week so in this video i'm gonna be breaking down this shoe i'll talk about the different materials used on this and how this sneaker is different than the regular version of the nike dunklow panda of course i'll get into sizing we'll talk about the prices what these are going for right now and as always i will be giving you guys that on feet look so make sure you stick around until the end of this video so here it is the nike dunk low black white next nature so this isn't the first dunk we have seen drop as part of the next nature line we've already seen two other dunks both of them were women's exclusives as well there was a pink colorway and also a white colorway both of those dunks of course sold out instantly and this time nike thought hey why don't we take by far the most popular sneaker of the year so far the nike dunklow and not just any dunk low i'm talking specifically about those panda dunks which have restocked countless number of times this year and every single time it sells out immediately it has already released in europe as well as some other parts of the world however north america the official release date of this sneaker is november the 3rd it won't be releasing on the nike sneakers app so make sure you check the regular nike app and it will also only be releasing as a women's exclusive to my knowledge it will only go up to a woman's size 9. this is the only version so far to drop with sustainably produced materials i know just by the looks of it it looks basically exactly like a regular nike dunklow panda however there definitely are some differences the first of which is that at least 20 of the materials used in the sneaker are in fact sustainable and not only that this sneaker is 100 vegan probably the biggest difference with this shoe has to be the box so of course we get a completely different box here this nike move to zero box which on the top outlines the mission of the campaign and at the back of the box it says in pretty much every language that it is a product made with at least 20 percent recycle content and you do see that nike pinwheel logo only sneakers that are part of the move to zero campaign have that logo and opening up the box you will notice that there is absolutely no paper that came with this box you just see the shoes once again nike's mission of course is zero waste and i guess that paper let's be honest all of us pretty much just throw that paper out of course this review wouldn't be complete if i didn't compare this sneaker to a regular nike dunk low so this is just your normal nike dunklow panda and looking at the shoes together yeah these sneakers look pretty much identical but i can definitely confirm that it doesn't feel the same of course that the regular version it is made with normal leather this version right here it seems like it is made out of a synthetic material it is of course a 100 vegan shoe the material kind of feels like plastic i don't really know any other way to describe it the other major difference between these two sneakers yeah you'll notice this next nature pair on the tongue of the sneaker you see that white nike logo on the tongue whereas the regular nike dunks they do come with that black nike logo and also the sock liner of these shoes you will notice that white sock liner on the next nature pair and a black sock liner on the regular nike dunks and the last major difference yeah you might have already noticed it just look at that insole you get this bright green or volt colored insole with that nike pinwheel logo and yeah you might be wondering do these dunk lows come with these beige laces no they do not these laces are in fact from my shop elevate laces i will leave that link in the description the shop does ship worldwide for a pretty affordable cost if you are interested in copying these other than that though pretty much the same shoe and definitely when you have these on feet they're gonna look exactly the same this sneaker has proven to be an extremely popular shoe and of course you can tell why it is the hottest silhouette of the moment and this particular colorway you can wear it pretty much every day because it goes with everything if you are wondering about sizing on these these fit true to size so it fits the same pretty much as nike air max sneakers or jordan ones if you normally wear a lot of air force ones i would say go a half size up than whatever your air force one size is and let's very quickly just have a look at the prices right now it looks like these next nature dunks are going for slightly lower than the regular nike dunk low pandas which make these definitely a bargain if you are of course someone who is very much concerned about sustainability and the fact that these shoes are vegan i definitely have a few friends who are very particular about buying vegan shoes then these are great because these are likely not going to be restocking unlike the regular nike dunklow pandas so i would suggest if you want this version to go ahead and buy it sooner rather than later because prices on these are likely going to go up if you are in the united states and you took an l on the sneaker on november the 3rd i would suggest waiting for about a week after that is when the prices are usually at their lowest so if you did take an l that would be the best time to buy but let's wrap this thing up overall the nike dunk low black white next nature great colorway goes with everything and you got to appreciate nike at least putting in some effort towards sustainability so i definitely give these shoes a cop let me know down in the description how do you guys feel about this pair the on feet about to drop right now but if you haven't already done so make sure you are subscribed to the channel i got a ton more videos on the way and follow me on instagram the handle is right here at jdkick6 easily the best place to contact me and i will see you guys next time peace you,2025-06-23 14:49:40.737898 UTC
Ai4raIPPnbs,PUMA Suede,what's goody I'm Queen G22 Ninja Turtles gaming geek stuff and travel and Hello Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in Puma the suede xl's y'all okay so y'all were at me so tough are you going to get the TMNT Puma collaboration I want to say of course it's it's a legitimate question because I'm not one of those ninja turtle fans that just because you slap Ninja Turtles on it that I'm like okay I need to have that and the Puma TMNT shoes that were like the Mellows or whatever wasn't kind of really my style so when those came out and everyone was like oh I was like yeah I would never wear those so I didn't feel that a need for those but these these are a little bit more of my style I mean I'm not like a skateboarder or anything but I like to wear Vans and I just like the low top you know the the low loaf type of looking shoe so when I saw my cousin was at all-star weekend and they had an event with you know where they're showing off the Pumas with the Ninja Turtle collaboration and when he sent me the video I was like yes yes yes oh and Jesus please get me those I love those so we're going to take a look at these TMNT Puma XL Suede Shoes I might have said that backwards and uh just see what it's giving because I'm I'm ready to slip these on right now first off I love this box right this box is super dope it looks looks like you got three pizzas stacked up and uh it's just super cool so obviously even though I am one of those to throw away boxes I'm not going to throw away this box I'm definitely going to keep my shoes in here and yes I'm going to wear them I know that there are people that like to buy stuff that is meant to be Worm but just have it on display N I rock my so just like I said with the bull airs you probably see me at a con wearing these shoes so let's continue to look at this box on one side we've got the three pizzas stacked up it says cabanga which is so neat we've got the Puma logo on the side and on the other side we've got the teenage mut Ninja Turtles logo uh the original one which is you know what when it comes to the Ninja Turtles in which series if it is the 87 cartoons I'm sold I want it I I definitely want it I'll lean a little bit with 2012 eh I might think about it with 2003 I'm not thinking about it if it's a rise Turtles but the 87 cartoon guys on the front oh yes I'm I'm definitely going to give it a good look and so that's pretty much it looks like all sides say either cow Bunga or teenage me Ninja Turtles on the front we have our original famous 1987 Ninja Turtles coming out of the logo which we love and down below Pizza Time which uh you know this whole thing I just love this whole vibe now when we open it up unfortunately there isn't pizza but there is something better than that and first off we get this cool little cardboard thing you know since we're not getting a pizza but since the whole theme Here is a pizza why not something neat like this and we've got all four Ninja Turtles and on the back we've just got the Puma and the Teenage new Ninja Turtles logo collaboration so this is really neat this is something that you can slap on the wall it's nice and thick and sturdy so it's a good piece of cardboard it's not flimsy so uh yeah I'm going to find a spot for this and I'm definitely going to put this on display because I just love this carony look of the Ninja Turtles once we move that out of the way move some of this paper oh so this is really cool yeah I'm going to be saying that a lot today like this is really cool so if it starts to get annoying I do apologize but it is because this is really cool so boom now we've got these cute little pin and our switch out laces so obviously I'm going to want to pop in these purple laces at some point most likely and I love how they give these you have these pins that you can kind of decorate the front of your laces I'm not going to do that on my video but I'm I'm sure somebody else has and you can take a look at it and because there's uh there's seven pins I'll be able to put all of them on my shoes by the way I'm assuming that this comes with all of them but I did have to order the uh big kids because I wear a six six and a half but I'm assuming that this comes on all these Suede Shoes hopefully they do let me know in the comments if yours didn't but I doubt it so we've got orange laces for Michaelangelo red laces for Raphael blue laces for Leonardo and purple laces for Donatella which is awesome we've got four pins here one for each turtle and then we've got three it looks like we got a pizza logo one that says TMNT and the other one is a PE sign which uh sure I guess you know right on so this is cool so you get this inside the box as well now after we move all that stuff out of the way let's get to the shoes I just I get really excited when I see stuff that is Ninja Turtle themed and it's something that I like and for a while I didn't think I was going to be able to get these shoes I thought I was only going to be able to get the other ones and I was like I don't want the other ones these now this is freaking cutest dude this is totally my vibe I would look adorable in these with some what do you call fitted pants or some shorts dude you can see your girl Queen G rocking these shoes so let's take a look at this this is like your old school old Vibe Puma shoe and I love that so one side has a purple stripe for Donatello and on the inside of that one we've got a red stripe for ra and on the other shoe we've got our orange stripe for Michelangelo and on the inside we have our blue stripe which nice job Puma right and normally like these type of things they would have put like the blue stripe on the outside dude like put Leonardo's ass in the inside like we don't not everybody wants to see Leonardo's ass we have my actual two favorite Turtles on the outside which is most likely what people are going to see so we'll start off with the Donnie and rapael shoe so this one comes with a little tag on it already and it just says city sewer and it looks like a sewer top which is awesome we have this beautiful green suede on the outside of this shoe and it's kind of giving like Ninja Turtle skin scaly it's kind of got that look on it which is awesome and on the back we've got our Puma logo which is super cute we got this brown on the bottom of our shoe for our soul it kind of gives the feel like you know the bubble gum or I'm not bubble gum but they gum soles right for Adidas andu like that I'm sure this is brown on purpose to represent the shell which is super cool but it does have that gum type feel which I'm a fan of the gum SES I love it you got a nice sturdy strong toe and then of course these ones come with the green laces uh that you could keep green or you can switch out I may switch out I may flipflop like one have purple and the other one have orange or something I don't know the options are endless and so yeah that's pretty much the shoe it's pretty simple design except it's got the scaly look on the out side the green laces on the top of the tongue we've got our Ninja Turtles and our Puma logo which is nice and don't forget what's going on and so on this shoe if you look inside the shoe pull this out you got your Ninja Turtles your 87 looking Ninja Turtles on the inside of your shoe so that's cute that's something to make you smile before you put your foot in the shoe and then once you remove the sole you've even got a picture of a pizza well not actually Pizza it looks like like it's cheese and pepperoni so I don't know like they just wanted to remind you that you're into pizza and uh you've got the pizza Vibes in there as well so you know just a nice little touch just to make sure it's totally Turtle powered and then on the bottom of this shoe and this shoe only the best shoe with Donatello stripe we've got cabanga on the bottom of the shoe so I love this collaboration with puma and the Ninja Turtles I think they did a hell of a job it's a puma shoe it is a brand that has been around for a while so you know this stitching and the craftsmanship and the quality of this shoe is amazing I I I think I've seen other people and other people's comments talk about oh you know these cool shoes and stuff they don't last very long well first of all what the are you doing where your shoes aren't lasting hella long like these type of shoes you shouldn't be wearing them every day I mean I'm not going to tell you how to wear your shoes but um I'm definitely not wearing these shoes every day this is a special occasion when I'm feeling extra cab bungus I get so but anyways this is Donatello's shoe and now Michelangelo and Leon Sho just kind of basic like they didn't even put a tag on this one the start off but they put a tag on Donatello and Raphael's shoe um I don't know what that's about but I feel special like they knew what they were doing we don't have no tag on the blue and the Michelangelo Stripes so I don't know what that's about but it's basically identical the green laces the you've got the Ninja Turtle and the Puma tag on the tongue the only thing with this one is that the inside take this out you just have the ninja turtles in the TMNT I mean the tmn TM Puma logo there there's no Ninja Turtles on here but you still do have the pizza on the inside and nothing on the bottom of the shoe you can clearly see the Puma logo on the bottom of the shoe but yeah these shoes are super cute I'm glad that puma and TMNT hooked up and did this collaboration I think is excellent marketing for Puma fans for ninja turtle fans for pop culture fans for cartoon fans for for whatever like this is a good way to ramp up your business for sure now they got people walking around in Ninja Turtle Puma sweat outfits which I would have got one but I wasn't really feeling the colors but anyways I think these shoes look fantastic so let's take a better look at the TMNT and Puma collaboration XL Suede Shoes freaking adorable right I love these shoes I'm definitely going to rock these not all the time but quite a bit of the time let me know in the comments what you think of the whole puma and teenage M Ninja Turtles collaboration I'm Queen G22,2025-06-23 14:42:17.175916 UTC

RDES7MHCQjc,Stan Smith,what's the deal with the new Vel Smiths how do they stack up to the velas and what does some guy on the internet think about these I'm Dustin Klein Cadence collection founder and former cycling product designer here to give you my honest opinion on the new Adida Stan Smith Vell I am glad to see Aida's continued commitment to cycling Footwear respect this shoe has some interesting Design Elements but first let's talk about the use case this category of Footwear thrives in the city I like to call it performance commuter pruter conformance it's the perfect blend of style and function you could ride cross town efficiently while at the same time not looking like a complete bike dork after you get to your destination it's brilliant and it took people a long time to figure out the stylistic and cultural icons of this category are the bike messenger were you ever a bike messenger which brings me to the silhouette the Stan Smith iconic shoe classic colorway it makes sense but most of the messengers I knew either ran sambas which they've got covered or the superstars so both of those are very City Centric shoes the Stan Smith just feels a little country club plus this is very white have you ever ridden a bike it's filthy it's like one step cleaner than digging a trench with that said these are still cool full grain leather same silhouette as the original the tongue has just a little bit of padding some elastic on either sides to keep it properly in the middle plus this cool elastic lace saver is just a nice touch it's helpful and I suspect a vegan version of this coming down the line it's exactly what they did with the Vel Samba a couple interesting notable details the gold foil stamp on the tongue of Stan Smith riding a bike that's a cool touch if you're into the cycling Footwear feel free to subscribe it's completely free and fits even better than this shoe thing that makes this and the veloma so special is the integrated nylon insole which stiffens up the shoe making it ideal for cycling plus there's a knockout for two bolt C compatibility it's awesome now the reinforced nylon insole has some texture and horizontal lines which I'm assuming are to help cleat placement on the shoe which is a nice touch it doesn't hurt it shows they care fit I'm a US1 and these come in for me true to size as a US1 something that's kind of interesting about these you can absolutely run them with a cleat they work great with clipless pedals but if you don't have clipless pedals you only do flat pedals or toe cages you don't don't have to put cleats on these for these to be beneficial that nylon outsole does a lot for helping you on the bike and if you're going to run a cleat on these walking around is pretty good you're not grinding that cleat on the ground like you do on more of a performance cycling shoe they they strike a good balance and honestly they're not even that heavy with these and the velosa there is a bit of a Breakin period they're a stiff shoe which is what we want but they get even better if you stick with it you know I think the stand Smiths are just a little bit more comfortable I personally like the look of the Vel Samba although I'd have to say the Comfort lies in the Vel stand I'm curious for you which way do you go style or Comfort when it comes to Footwear I've been wearing these for last week and ultimately I'm impressed on the bike they're fantastic and when you're walking around they're a little weird at first to get used to but you adjust and then you kind of they just feel normal I mean they are a cycling performance shoe so if you're doing a lot of walking maybe not the best but if your life is a balance of the two you'd be fine like if you worked at a bike shop rode to work worked at the bike shop all day and rode home you could absolutely wear these all day well this is a cool detail I just realized this middle section on the back of the shoe is reflective ultimately there's not much I would change about this shoe which is great I think I would prefer it to be a superstar or come in Black whichever comes first if you're curious about their gravel shoe a more performance shoe you should check out this video but if you'd like to know that much more about the Vel Samba I got you covered that's right here yeah ultimately I think the velos samb is my pick just cuz I like the way it looks that's just me,2025-06-19 08:39:27.138947 UTC
i50nq7Ty0io,Reebok Club C 85 Vintage shoes,what's up YouTube for this video let's talk about two very iconic sneakers here we have the Adidas Stan Smiths and here we have the rebok club c85 both of these sneakers are very classic and iconic they've been around for many decades now and they are still arguably some of the most popular shoes to still exist so in this video I want to compare these two shoes and put them head-to-head we're going to talk about price comfort and materials style and then at the end of the video we might have to make a decision as to which between these two shoes are better so you'll want to stick around to the end of the video to find out but hopefully this video will help you with your purchasing decisions if you're considering buying one of these shoes or if you're just wanting to learn more about some of the most classic sneakers of all time so that being said let's get into it so first let's compare the price the reason I wanted to put these two shoes together in a head-to-head battle and compare them together is not only do they have a fairly similar shape and Silhouettes but they also run in a pretty similar price range the St Smiths technically retail for $95 according to the Adidas website but I was able to manage to catch these on sale for about $70 on the contrary with the club C 85s uh these retail for $85 on the website but I was also able to get these on sale for about $70 as well so technically the stand Smiths are a little more expensive at retail for $95 but most times between these two shoes you should be able to find a fairly similar discount on them pretty much for me I was able to get both of these for right around the $70 range all right next let's compare the materials and the Comfort between these two shoes first off starting with the Stan Smiths the upper is mainly comprised of a vegan synthetic leather not too long ago Adidas has made the effort to transition into utilizing more sustainable materials so now based on the website they utilize about 50% of recycled materials uh for their uppers so you pretty much got vegan synthetic leather throughout the upper here and through the tongue and then as we move to the bottom portion of the shoe the out soole is pretty much a rubberized outsole and then the midle here although it's kind of a bit on the firm side that will mean that it provides its standard Arch stability and support now as for the club C 85s the upper on these is made of more of a nice soft and plush pebbled leather the toe box is nice and soft to the touch but moving on to the tongue and the inner lining of this shoe it's made of more of like a mesh type of material for the midsole cushioning you have the Eva midsole and then the out soole of these is also a rubberized outsole just like the Stan Smiths but personally for me I would choose a Rebox over the Adidas in terms of comfort for a few reasons reason number one is that the upper and the leather on these is a little more soft and plush to the touch and it also gives the toe boox a little more flexibility reason number two is I also get a little more rear foot stability in the club c 85s as well given the mesh inner lining and not sure if you can see it but there's also a bit of a divot or a support in the Achilles area in the back heel part here whereas the rear foot part of the Stan Smiths is the inner lining is a little bit more of that smooth vegan leather uh so it doesn't quite hug my heel as nicely as a Rebox and reason number three is that I tend to have a little bit more standard maybe even narrow feet the club c85 is run a little more narrow which means it hugs my foot a little better so on the contrary if you do have wider feet I would suggest you go with the Stan Smiths over the Rebox I actually made a video sometime in the past regarding how to choose the proper foot wear for your foot shape I'll leave the card up top somewhere over there but uh check out that video after you finish this one if you want to learn more about the science behind finding your proper Footwear all in all even though I personally chose the club c85 over the Dan Smith's for Comfort uh take my advice with a grain of salt the differences between the two are actually pretty negligible and you don't really notice it unless you actually wear both of these shoes time and time again but either way it's always best if you can just try the shoes for yourself in order to make the most Sound Decision for yourself all right next let's talk about style between these two shoes now this part is very subjective as each person has their own personal style and taste but here is my personal take both of these tennis sneakers have a lot of similarities to offer from theow top shape and Silhouettes the mostly white uppers you have the flat laces you have the stitched in moles you have the rubberized outsoles and even with these two pairs in particular you have the subtle green accents for The Branding but where I feel like these two shoes stand out in terms of style is their utilization of their materials as well as the consideration of where these shoes stand in the fashion scene so what do I mean by that let's talk about the Stan Smiths first in terms of the Stan Smiths I feel I feel like in general these shoes are a little more popular and they tend to cater more to the high-end fashion industry from my research I feel like there have been more celebrities that have endorsed and been caught wearing these shoes out there have been photos of like the Jonas Brothers Kendall Jenner Jessica Alba Haley Bieber Justin Timberlake the Kardashians and even Kanye himself so not only has more high-end celebrities been caught wearing these shoes but I feel like the high-end fashion brand FS have also caught more inspiration from their designs off this dance SMS so for some examples you have Clay Footwear making their shoe called the Bradley's which run for about $150 you have the common projects with their retro lows which run for I think $400 and then you have the Alexander McQueens which run for about $600 and I don't think you can deny that although they're different shoes they have some similarities and they probably drew some level of inspiration from the Stan Smiths on the other hand with the club C8 I in my opinion they just don't seem as popular this is not at all to take away from the club the 85s they're not any less stylish than the St Smiths are but just in terms of society and the industry you just don't see the club C 85s having as much traction as the Stan Smiths do all in all both shoes have a lot of similarities to offer in terms of style they've both been worn by all types of people they're both very versatile and can be dressed up and dressed down so really you can't go wrong with either option in terms of style but over overall my take in terms of style is that if you want to be a little more trendy if you want to follow more of the high-end celebrities or if you want to look a little more upscale in terms of the fashion scene then I would go with the stance SMS if you want to be a little more low profile still have a good quality sneaker without the popularity and The Branding behind what everyone else is doing I would go with the club c85 so after briefly comparing these two shoes here are my overall thoughts when it comes to price the St Smiths retail for9 $95 but the Rebox retail for $85 which technically makes these the more affordable option on the list personally though I was able to attain both of these shoes for around the $70 range but if you are trying to buy these at full price rebok are the more affordable option when it comes to comfort this is subjective but I personally feel like I prefer the comfort of the club C 85s over the Stan Smiths the uppers on the Rebox are just more plush more soft more flexible in the toe box and I do get a little more rear foot stability in the Rebox as well compared to the Stan Smiths lastly in terms of style I might have to choose the Stan Smiths over the club 85s the Stan Smiths have technically been around for a longer period of time but although both of these shoes are very classic and Timeless for years to come I think the Stan Smiths are generally a more popular and respectable shoe they have a bit of a richer history and I think that does speak volumes when you see higher-end celebrities and high-end fashion brands uh show their appreciation for this shoe in particular all in all both of these tennis sneakers are great options to have in your sneaker rotation and you really cannot go wrong with either option I would love to hear your thoughts in the comments below which between these two would you choose or if you've already tried these shoes how do you style them I'd love to hear about it in the comments below if you made it this far in the video please do me a huge favor hit that like button it'll help me

qQ3-u0yR0nU,Onitsuka Mexico 66,what's up YouTube it's your boy dery Chan I have a pair of onisuka tigers that my cousin Donnie has been wearing as you guys know you probably seen the real versus fake onisuka tiger video and then you also seen the onisuka tiger review video this pair is from my cousin Donnie he loves this brand and this pair is the Mexico 66 that he's woron for a year and he wore this very often he would he tells me that he would wear it every day for a week and then stop and then wear it again for another week so this has a Year's worth of wear in it and you can tell it is pretty worn creases smudges all over the leather the so's all beaten up so this colorway he bought a new one and you can see that new video on my channel so came over today and these beaten up ones and I pretty much said hey tell me your thoughts what did you think about the shoe after wearing it for a year let me do a quick video so he told me the pros and cons and we're just going to hop right into them yeah let's look at this beaten up pair of shoes the laces still intact but 30 the suede still intact as well now even though he wore this for a year the creasing is not too bad other shoes like Air Force Ones Stan Smiths sambas the creases are a lot deeper and more noticeable after a year but if you look at this onuka Tiga the creases are still very manageable they don't look too deep and keep this in mind my cousin Donnie did not put a suit Tree in these at all he told me these were just his beaters you throw them on run errands go to the gym and it pretty much held up so the Lev the quality is very bespoke no issues with the eyelids he told me he would tighten them retie them quite often no issues there now he did wear these with jeans and you can see there is some color bleed on the ankle area of the suede so when you wear those blue jeans it will transfer over but it looks like it's very minimal just on the outer edge of the anle area he's told me he's wiped these shoes down a bit with some warm water and he tried to avoid the suede as much as possible so you see the suede is a little bit dirty but you can clean that up with a brush but the leather itself still looks very nice and it has this nice slight patina to him looks a little bit yellow just a smidge almost like a cream color so it does age over time all right let's look at the back tab so this back tab is very very flimsy now softened up a lot you can see more of that color bleeding from jeans moving onto the shoe but this back tab is very soft and supple and he tells me that this tab is very comfortable he could wear low ankle socks and this part doesn't irritate him too much let's take a look at the soles yeah a lot of that damage it's towards the heel of the shoe a lot of it got shaved off yeah almost bare to the Mido so you know maybe another year or two of wear left in these before holes start to form but other than that the middle tread is still intact very nice and the ball of the foot that tread pattern is still intact as well not too much of that was shaving off so yeah you still get a lot of tread on these after a year of wear it's just that the heel is a little bit shaved off there and then yeah some darkness of the suede the leather's still intact the logo suede is still intact no damage there I guess the main points of damage is just the heal area balls of the foot yeah it's a very nice shoe I mean there's a little bit of leather scuffing right there guess my cousin Donnie uh must have ran into something chip off some of that leather top with the leather but other than that this shoe looks pretty pristine not a lot of damage done on the toe box just a little bit of Shaving of that rubber off very nice yeah so these don't look too bad after a year of wear and my cousin Donnie tells me that the insole inside molded to his feet a bit so once he puts this in it kind of wraps around his foot makes him feel very secure walking in these is fine but he tells me sometimes he just slips in an insole into these if he's going to walk a bit longer now there is a good amount of arch support in this shoe so sometimes if you put it insole he tells me that you get even more arch support so that might be uncomfortable for some people but he could do without the insole because this shoe if you look here this is where the arch support end so your feet really is contained in this shoe pretty well and lots of comfort so yeah that's pretty much it onee review of the Oni Suka Mexico 36 shoe holding up pretty well I can see this going for another two years of daily wear before it finally Taps out so this does look like it can last a good amount of wears so good quality shoe put it up there with New Balance in terms of durability all right guys that's all I have chow chow chow,2025-06-23 14:44:47.634253 UTC
_4g-1Qlqdkw,on cloudmonster 2,what's up Zach here and today I've got the allnew on cloud monster 2 and from the V1 some pretty interesting upgrades to them they're really subtle but they do make the shoe feel a lot different once you actually start getting them up to speed let's get into it and thank you to on running for sending me a pair of the cloud monster V2 to check out however this video is by no means sponsored in all opinions good bad and indifferent are all of my own now the uppers of the cloud monster 2 are pretty similar to The Originals it's that panel mesh mixed with that real micro TPU mesh it is very light but the tongue in these things has a pretty aggressive gusset there's actually a lot of material underneath that top layer of upper now the lace line is an external rope lace eyelet system it does give you a runner's knot the tongue is pretty thin in Porous so if you are cranking on that Runner knot you are going to get a little bit of irritation in there before the shoe breaks in you can just put a piece of mol skin under there and it really takes care of it but speaking of that tongue and forefoot if you look at the breathability test on these things they heated up 100 8.8 de and you know if you look at the breathability mapping of them it did hold on to some of that fog in there the thing is is the materials in these are so light but also a little bit stronger than some other more maximalist or Super Shoes out there so you might be sacrificing a few degrees of breathability for a little bit more of a maximalist lock down in these but because they are so light is it really going to matter if you're sweating or heating them up so much because in reality the top layer the upper the tongue and the gusset the materials on them are just so light that I don't think they're going to be able to hold on to a lot of heat and moisture anyway so to me these really straddle the line of feeling like more of a super shoe in terms of light uppers but also giving you just a little bit more lock down and security and some other shoes in its class and on the upper durability test 10 seconds High git sandpaper yeah I mean the bird do start to work through these however you know these are Road running shoes and really the strength in these uppers is is its resistance to blunt trauma and it working together to create a little bit more containment around your entire foot and to create almost like a Gibney boot around your foot I did notice with these with the runners notot heel slippage really only mild to moderate I thought the heel slippage was better in the twos versus the ones remember it is more of a minimalist heel counter Road running shoe so you are going to get a little bit of play there but as long as you have a runner's not in there and break them in adequately you should be just fine all right now getting into the mid so on the tear down though this is where I see the biggest material change from the V1 to the V2 and that biggest change to me comes in the fact that there is a super dense slab of foam between you and the speedboard now you still do have a traditional strob bable on this hover or right underneath the strobo board is a pretty dense fulllength foam which is actually more dense than the helon underneath of it so you do have a dual density typical in those dual density Foams the spongier softer foam is on top whereas in on they put the denser foam on top I think to protect your heel from the speedboard now speaking of that speedboard that speedboard only goes to your metat Taral heads versus on a lot of other on shoes specifically the cloud monster V1 goes full length now I like this in particular because then in the for foot you're actually getting a little more forgiveness and in my mind that's where I felt a lot more the forgiveness in these I was wondering why my heel wasn't feeling hard plastic on this cuz I knew the speedboard at least went back into the heel and that's cuz there is just a super dense foam right underneath of your foot there and the other thing I noticed is from the V1 to the V2 the cloud Tech pods and the helon foam that goes around there just a little bit more spongy a little bit softer versus on the V1 now remember you can't make the cloud Tech pods you can't make that helon foam too soft or those pods just going to compress into Oblivion something has to hold them up but remember versus some on shoes where you can actually see the speed board in the middle of the shoe it's hollowed out so they really have to be strong this is a continuous midsole right so you can make the Foam a little bit softer and still have enough density to hold those Cloud Tech pods up even though you can see through the shoe there's just a lot more room to inject more foam into a shoe that doesn't have the entire middle of it cut out now if you look at the bounce height test on this only got 26 cm in the heel and then 30 in the 4ot and to me the reason the for got a little better is cuz the speedboard is not there remember that speedboard that's a liquid injected thermoplastic which is basically a peba type foam a plastic substitute now there are a lot more elastomers in this type of plastic substitute however you're not going to catch that on a bounce height test right that's more for when the shoe is compressing and that's really where these shoes do their best and we'll talk about that when we get to the speed ratio of these but suffice to say really I wasn't surprised that what I on the bounce height test because number one I expected it to be hitting you know hard plastic but that foam over top of the speedboard is mainly meant so that your foot doesn't feel the speedboard and that's going to be much more of a shock dampening shock absorbing type sensation versus some other shoes where it's like zoomx foam or peex type foam where you're getting the crazy launch and looking at the outso Trad of the cloud monster V2 it it's nearly identical to the V1 except for the fact that the tread insert and the 4f foot is all connected uh but it is still that pretty flat Cobblestone type pattern on the grip test ramp slips at 43° which you know you would expect cuz this serated foam is actually contacting that cement as well as this pretty flat tread from on you know with this it's mainly meant for ease of Glide ease of stride I should say now if you look at this on the speed ratio only comes in at a 2.47 however shank score of 0.4 brings it up to a 2.87 and honestly even though these are fast shoes I do think that a 2.87 is where these really lie I think that's a pretty accurate representation because the cloud monster as well as a lot of other on shoes are really dependent on your stride your stride length how you hit the ground and mainly what is your midstance look like so we'll talk about that in the runability section I I will say though these are incredibly fast shoes for the right Runner and they're incredibly I'd say Aver shoes for some other Runners which we'll talk about when we get to the runability if you look at the AL durability test though 10secs High grid sandpaper yeah I mean really maybe a millimeter of damage on this the durometer is actually really high remember this is very thin light rubber so they make it pretty hard right and they make it pretty flat so it lasts a pretty long time I've noticed with all the on shoes that I've had for a pretty long time the tread does last fine it's just that it is meant for Road running right you're not going to be able to take this on very slick like rocks through a creek or something right like I wouldn't try to take this trail running but for what they are trying to get easy Glide and and lower braking forces on asphalt cement concrete things like that I think this does fantastic and I think it is a a really perfect combination of enough grip but also enough forgiveness to get from stride to stride because remember we talked about in the grip test ramp we're doing some other shoes you do not want too high of a grip right you don't want too high of a coefficient of friction or it's going to destroy your patellar tenant it's going to destroy a lot of other things so I do think that if it ain't broke don't fix it now the fit of the cloud monsters is a little bit more forgiving than I thought they would be it is still panel mesh but pretty standard length and then the width is just a little you know hair on the forgiving side I think a narrow medium foot just go true to size even a 2E for me I'd probably try to break these in true to size unless you have a bunion or Taylor's bunion just cuz number one you get the weight reduction for a little bit of an easier stride but number two because of the midsole geometry when you come down in stance and especially right after propulsion in the first phase of Swing you want to be one to one in these cuz that's what's going to give you the best kick on these getting your foot especially your metat tarsal heads one to one but when talking about the snake bitten foot you know any lumps bumps bruises anything like that things that are nagging you on the bottom of your foot in terms of ball of foot pain these are just infinitely better than the cloud monster V1 I mean it's not even the same shoe not even playing the same sport so that has been an incredible Leap Forward from the V1 to the V2 in terms of of heel pain initially they're fine I think once that foam starts to bottom though especially if you're a heel Striker midfoot Striker you're going to start to notice that speed board over time I think if you put a low profile orthotic in these because of the lock down in these it is a little bit better versus the V1 I think you can get a lower profile orthotic and I think that negates some of the heel issues once that top loaded foam starts to bottom and I think if you can find a low profile orthotic for these that really covers most of your bases because in the 4f foot it is just very forgiving because of the density of the Foams on there I do think with a lowprofile orthotic these do kind of get up into that good for territory and when they are new they're pretty good for just about everything it's just that if you're a 4 foot Striker on these I think then you're probably good just from the jump and you're fine getting into the midfoot proximal midfoot and heel I think like I said with the orthotic I think that bumps these up to pretty good for most things but getting into the all important runability and which Runners these are best for now number one you know the cloud monsters do have a little bit of a 4ot rocker right the thing with that is I found that having a 4ft striking gate you really had to get used to it right I mean if you're used to the cloud monster the V1 you probably get used to this pretty quick too it's just that some people I know have a little bit of issues with it because you got to hit it at the right spot you really got to kind of tune your gate to hit these at the right spot for a 4ft strike the thing is though with the medial flange though in the forefoot you know I mean they're stable enough in the forefoot and you do get a decent amount of kick with them to me a midfoot striker on these is okay but it's really heel Strikers and four-foot Strikers that do best things I know that that that's really weird and I know four-foot Strikers are going to roll their eyes at me but with the speed board plus the cloud Tech pods these do best when you're giving these a full stride which means that you are loading that speedboard and all those Cloud Tech pods through an entire gate cycle CU you're giving it all that potential energy and it's turning it into all that kinetic energy I found and that's why I always say with a lot of these on shoes they do so well climbing Hills right because when you're climbing those Hills that Kickback action these you can really feel it's it's almost propelling you forward it's a really unique sensation now for people that have a very up and down or almost marching running gate right these you're really just not going to feel any of the benefits right because you do need a little bit of a reach on these to get these to kind of kick into action and get that kicking action in there so if you are somebody with pretty short strides pretty up and down you know marching type strides I mean they're fine it's just that you're not going to get the benefits of these if you're somebody that does have a little bit more reach out there right and you are someone who does get their leg a little bit further out and have that nice rolling action to your gate have a pretty fluid complete stride that's when you're really going to notice the insane propulsion of these much like the V1 it's just in the V2 it's a little bit more comfortable your foot kind of sinks into that more dense foam you're not getting a lot of the rocking right the these do kind of stay a little bit more centered little bit more stable than the V1 all these upgrades look subtle from the outside but it's when you actually start running them it's when you actually start using them for a while that you notice just how much more finely tuned the V2s are so it's still not the most plush shoe on the planet right it's not the cloud Surfer it's not the Invincible Run 3 but if you need a shoe that gives you quite a bit of kick and is a shoe that if you have a really strong push off and back swing is going to give you a ton of propulsion plus a shoe that's very easy to get up and down a hill with if you're running on those types of circuits then I think once again these are one of the best shoes out there but I'd love to hear your thoughts on the cloud monsters are you going with them are you picking up discounted pairs of the v1's or going with something else completely let me know in the comments down below and if you want see another sibling to the oncloud monster V2 what I think is the most forgiving and plush on shoe on the market the cloud Surfer going to the knife make sure you click into this video up above and subscribe down

them to be extremely comfortable so if you guys want to check them out and try a pair for yourself be sure to use the code Sean go at checkout to get 15 off your entire purchase so after months and months and months of waiting and high anticipation New Balance finally released their sixth generation of the iconic 990 series releasing that new balance on November 4th for a retail price of 200 US dollars or 260 here in Canada the debut colorway of the 990 V6 is of course none other than the iconic gray color so the stock code for this shoe is m990 gl6 and I think it's safe to say that when the initial images of the V6 leaked the reaction in the community was pretty mixed there was definitely a ton of hate surrounding this model but there were definitely New Balance heads out there that were a fan of this shoe for me at least I was kind of mixed I was so used to the more classic looking designs of the V3 the V4 and the V5 and the fact that the last three 990s kind of look all similar and I think why it took some time to grow on me it's because this V6 is so different design wise and I gotta say now that I have them in hand and now that I've really had time to soak up the design it's a much more modern looking shoe and I think I can confidently say now that I am a fan of this model even when you compare the V5 to the V6 the V6 just looks much more youthful it looks more Dynamic looking and organic and not only does it look more like a modern lifestyle shoe but it also features more performance Tech within as well which makes it The Best of Both Worlds being a great casual shoe but also don't quote me on this but probably being a decent running shoe as well so first things first here's a quick look at the box and unlike the dark gray cardboard boxes that the past 980 V5 came in this comes in a lighter gray cardboard box with this dark gray New Balance logo on the top so with all that being said now let's dive into the details of the shoe and I'll break down all the components so starting things off with a toe box the base layer of the shoe is constructed out of this Gray colored mesh material right above this we have this reflective 3M hit with a new balance logo along with another 3M hit on the medial edge of the toe box and then overlaid on either side we have this perforated dark gray nubuck surrounding the front toe cap we have this very soft very buttery light gray colored Suede and the same suede covers the eyelets of the shoe as well as along the bottom of the mid panel as well in between this we have more of that perforated nubuck but stitched on top of this we have this new balance and Logo which is once again constructed out of that reflective 3M material and a combination of silver and white and you might notice that the V6 has done away with a lot of suede on the upper which gives it more that sporty modern look that I was referring to earlier moving downwards so the top two eyelets are covered in this reflective 3M panel once again and then underneath this we have another reflective panel which runs along the back of the shoe beneath this we have this gray suede which wraps around the bottom of the heel and press onto the lateral side we have 990 branding in the middle of the heel we have this dark gray colored teepee overlay which gives you additional structure and support for the back end of the shoe and in the middle we have the New Balance logo and underneath that we have made in USA branding and the top of the heel is covered in this layer of dark gray mesh in terms of lease options so these come with two different laces which was a nice surprise the standard default lace that they come with is a flat style lace in white but they also give you a gray colored lace as well underneath this sew the bottom half of the tongue is constructed out of that same mesh that we saw earlier on the toe box but we have this mesh overlay towards the top and this is that same mesh that we saw earlier on the back of the shoe and then fuse onto the top we have this New Balance 990 V6 branding which if you notice compared to the V5 does away with that American flag so the back of the tongue and the interior of the shoe is lined in this light gray colored mesh material and then as for the insoles so these come with your standard foam line insole it's not overly thick and padded but it has a decent amount of cushioning to it and then stamped on the heel we have New Balance running branding in white so the upper of the 990v6 set to Top This Very chunky midsole which is painted primarily in white so the midsole here incorporates New Balances fuel cell technology which is a tech that's normally found on their top running shoes and the overall midsole has a very sculpted and dynamic look to it which makes it look more athletic looking and more aggressive too in addition to the fuel cell they also Incorporated the time and tested end-cap technology which is this Gray colored wedge which wraps around the heel and this is basically that same dual density foam setup consisting of a softer Eva core surrounded by a stiffer polyurethane brim giving you a good balance of softness in the middle and support on the edges and then finally flipping the shoe over to the bottom so this is an all new design outsole as well so this is constructed out of rubber in a combination of black and gray we have this wavy style traction pattern on the forefoot along with these horizontal grooves to give you added flexibility and on the medial side of the heel we have the New Balance branding along with this exposed fuel cell wedge on the bottom and here you'll see fuel cell branding as well so that breaks down the look and the components of the New Balance 990 V6 and for those wondering about sizing that's probably the million dollar question for anyone watching this video because the 990v6 is offered in different widths they actually offer standard wide extra wide and xx wide because my feet are a little bit on the wider side I picked up pairs in both the standard width and the wide width just to compare so my feet measures as a true size 10 slightly on The Wider side and I usually go a half size down in a nine and a half and a lot of made in USA New Balance models for example the 990v3 V4 V5 the 992 the 993 as well as other models like the 998 and a lot of my 550s as well so I picked these up in a nine and a half standard a 10 standard and a nine and a half wide and long story short I feel like these run a little bit long but a little bit narrow as well so if you have narrow or normal width feet I would definitely recommend going a half size down when I tried on my pair that was half size down there was about a fingers width between the edge of the shoe and the top of my toe which is more more than enough but I have to warn wide Footers if you have especially a high instep this area right here where the bottom lace is this could irritate the front half of your foot so it wasn't totally uncomfortable for me but I could feel some of that pressure pressing down right beneath my toes so when I tried on the nine and a half wide the length of the shoe was perfect once again and there was much more room width-wise but I felt like going to that 2E width I lost a bit of stability my foot didn't really feel as secure as the standard width pair so I tried on my nine and a half in this one compared to my 990v3 and V4 and I felt like the V6 ran a touch more narrow especially around this area right here but if anything they ran a little bit longer lengthwise so again it depends on the width of your foot but I feel like for most people if you stick with that standard width and go a half size down you should be okay the only issue comes across is if you do have wider foot whether you should stick true to size or go up to that wide width so I would definitely recommend buying the mod if you can first in order to properly assess what size fits best for you so I know I just rambled a lot right now but hopefully that gives you a better sense of how these fit moving on to the Comfort so the V6 once again incorporates fuel cell and my overall impression just wearing these casually is that they definitely feel softer overall and you do sacrifice a lot of the stability and support that the v5s had over these so this goes back to personal preference once again if you're someone that likes more of a cushioned and softer and pillowy feel then you'll like these v6s over the v5s and the prior models in fact but if you're someone that likes more stability and support then you might not love this even when I compare this to the V3 so once again the cushioning was a lot softer but the V3 just felt more of a well-balanced and supported shoe especially on this heel area where it's extra chunky when you lean backwards and put all your weight towards your heel it kind of feels like you're wobbling a bit and I felt a noticeable difference in terms of cushioning between the forefoot and the heel where it feels like there's just way more stacked cushioning on the heel so this goes back to the concept of the V3 being a more balanced shoe I just felt like the differences between the heel and the forefoot were more noticeable for this one and it comes down once again to personal preference on how you like your shoes to feel underfoot but don't get me wrong the V6 is a very very comfortable sneaker and I think this is definitely a shoe I can wear for long hours in a day and I'll probably bring the shoe with me on my upcoming vacation as well just to see how they hold up finally in terms of the overall quality and the craftsmanship so first off material quality I thought it was solid this is definitely just in line with any other made in USA 990 the only difference is of course there's less suede on this shoe compared to those previous versions there's a lot more synthetic materials meshes and TPU overlays which some people will definitely not like but I feel like this shoe is noticeably lighter compared to those other models as well and in terms of the build and the craftsmanship really I had no issues at all with this pair there were no glue stains the Stitch knob was pretty pristine so I got to say New Balance did a really solid job with this 990 V6 which they probably should do anyways considering this is the launch pair of the silhouette so with all that out of the way now let's toss these on feet and show you guys how these look foreign so all in all the 980 V6 has a lot of good changes and a lot of not so good changes depending on your personal preferences at the end of the day though for me at least I like the design of this shoe and I think the comfort is definitely still there compared to those past versions it's just a little bit tweaked and it feels a bit different underfoot which I personally didn't mind at all and knowing New Balance I'm very excited to see future colorways of this V6 as well as upcoming collaborations which I know are definitely coming down the pipeline it's just a matter of who and when so let me know in the comment section down below what you guys think but this great colorway of the new bounce 990 V6 what are your overall thoughts on the silhouette in general and is this a model that you think you would pick up eventually whether it's a general release colorway an upcoming collab let me know in the comment section down below your overall thoughts if you guys like this video be sure to like comment and subscribe to my channel if you haven't yet you can follow me

Hzc-adnIbsU,Yeezy 350 v2,what's up everybody it's Seth Fowler and today I'm reviewing the Adidas Yeezy boost 350 V2 zebra before I get into the video I just want to give a huge shout out to Ari the blar on Twitter he's an awesome guy he was watching our live stream for the Yeezy release on Saturday and I wasn't able to grab a pair but he was able to grab me a cart the love that you guys show me is incredible I can't thank you guys enough for that but in particular thank you so much to Ari the blar I'll make sure to leave a link to his Twitter and all that sort of good stuff in the description below so make sure to check it out thanks so much for tuning in today guys make sure to hit that subscribe button down below if you haven't yet but with all that being said let's get into it last Saturday Adidas restocked the very highly coveted Yeezy boost 350 V2 turning it from the most limited V2 to now basically one of the most common V2s and some people weren't too happy about that because they spent over a grand on this shoe but you know patience is a virtue and if you waited it out you got lucky to answer a lot of your questions right off the bat this is exactly the same shoe as the previous zebra the only difference is production dates so resale is going to pretty much drop regardless because there are so many more of them on the market unlike the pirate black restock from last year they haven't made any changes to the shoe so if you're buying it for resale you could get the newer version you could get the older version it doesn't really matter but without further Ado here they are the Adidas Yeezy boost 350 V2 zebra starting off with the upper you've got the same thicker primate that you find in all the other Yeezy boost 350 V2s it's definitely thicker than the primate that you find find on the ultra boost and the nmds however I don't mind it it's still breathable it's still comfortable and it gives the shoe a little bit more structure of course as you can tell it is white and black prime it hence the name zebra especially when you look on the medial side you see these sort of almost zebra stripes going on this pattern can actually be found in all the Yeezy 350 V2s except in different colors some colorways are harder to see like the triple white creams or the bread colorway but because this is a black and white colorway it's really easy to see running from the toe box to the top of the tongue and then again from the back of the heel all the way down to the sole of the shoe you've got that signature Yeezy stitching down the middle it's a touch that I've always liked on the Yeezy boost 350s however it's definitely harder to see on this colorway because there is so much going on you've still got your rope laces weaving through the prime nit this time around they're all white moving back in the shoe you find those signature Stripes that you have on all the other V2s this time around they're both in white on the midfoot of the shoe you've got your one hit of color with the mirrored sply 350 I personally don't love the fact that it's in bright red I would have liked it in a more muted color but that's just me none of the Yeezys are really muted or understated at all they're kind of crazy and out there which is another reason why I like them but in some cases like this you've already got this crazy pattern going on I wouldn't have minded if that was like a gray or something like that not only that but I still don't know what that sply stands for and I've heard people say that it stands for St Pablo loves you I've heard Supply I've heard all sorts of crazy things first of all I hope it's not St Pablo loves you because that's stupid secondly I originally thought it meant Supply because that sort of makes sense like like Yeezy Supply you know what I mean but Supply would probably have two PS in it no one who doesn't have connects to Adidas higher-ups or Kanye really knows what that means inside the shoe you've got your standard Yeezy insole this time around it's in white with Adidas and Yeezy written in Black in the past a really great way to check if your Yeezys were fake would be to check the bottom of the insole to sort of see the pattern that's going on underneath there the problem is fakes have gotten so good especially with V2s there really isn't a Surefire way to tell anymore unfortunately and it's not a bad idea to check the bottom of the insole but you might want to check some other things too the interior of the shoe is still the same you've still got really great padding around the heel and then raw primed it on the inside of the shoe right underneath the tongue you've got these patches of suede just to reinforce the eyelids which I think is a nice touch and of course the laces weave through the primate so they are going to be right up against your foot and honestly I've worn my pairs of Yeezys a lot and it's never bothered me and in fact I haven't ever felt it so it's not a big deal as for fit I prefer to go true to size on the Yeezy 350 V2s I think they just fit better for me that way but some people think they fit a little bit small so it doesn't hurt to go up half a size either it really depends on how you like your shoes to fit if you have the chance to try these on first which you know that's that's kind of a rare chance but if you do have that chance definitely try them on first just to make sure that they fit you right if you can't I don't think it hurts to go true to size worse comes to worse you just take out the insole and it'll fit fine moving around to the back of the shoe the heel tab that wasn't on some of the early pairs of the 350 V2s has returned on the zebras and the creams and a couple of other pairs it's definitely a source of contention for some people some people hate it some people love it I'm kind of apathetic I think it looks fine I don't have a problem with it at all moving down the shoe you've got that signature Yeezy midsole ribbing that everyone knows and loves of course the material is a semi-translucent white or creamy material so you can sort of see through to the Boost and you can definitely see where the midsole connects to the primate upper the only thing I don't like about the midsole is where the outs soole connects to the back of the midsole I think that's a really weird place to connect the two parts especially when they're different colors as you can tell the out soole is really a creamy yellow and the midsole is more of that milky white so when they connect right here it almost looks like the white midsole is yellowing and I think that looks terrible and they've done it in all the other V2s and I really don't get why they do that because it just it's not working for me and I know a lot of people who just don't like the way it looks it's an interesting touch uh I don't understand the reasoning behind it but you know what you live with it and finally moving to the bottom of the shoe you've got your standard Yeezy 350 V2 out soole with punch outs to the Boost if you've never tried on a pair of Yeezys boosts his life it's crazy comfortable it's not as comfy as Ultra boost but it's not bad overall I really love the Adidas Yeezy 350 V2 zebra and not only because it's a Yeezy I really love the silhouette of the V2s I think it's a really clean sneaker even though the Design's a little out there and a little crazy I actually really dig it because you really can wear it with anything and the reason for that is that no matter what you wear this with it's going to pop it's going to be out there so no matter what you really can't go wrong if you weren't lucky enough to grab a pair of these from the restock the good news is is that Yeezy resale prices have been dropping so you can actually grab these for around 500 600 bucks which is not bad compared to what they used to be if you're not looking to spend that much I'm sure there's going to be another Yeezy dropping next month so just wait till then now that we've got the review out of the way let's throw these guys on feet and see how they look he that's pretty much it for the video today guys make sure to leave a comment in the comment section down below letting me know what your favorite Yeezy boost 350 V2 is and if the zebra is it and as always guys thank you so much for watching please make sure to give

LjWNaAnX_OY,New balance 550,what's up everybody it's sean here back today to give you a review of the new bounds 550 in this white and green colorway so one of the most popular new bound silhouettes in the past couple of years the new balance 550 returned recently in a trio of colorways so alongside this white and green pair new balance also released a white and navy pair along with this white and purple pair too so all three retail for a price of 120 usd each or 150 canadian and the style code for this green pair which is my personal favorite is bb550wt1 so i managed to grab all three pairs over at the closet inc here in canada so the closet inc is an independently owned boutique operated here in southern ontario in canada and they recently started to get new balance shoes as well so for all my canadian viewers out there i'll link their social media their website all that good stuff down below so be sure to check them out and show them some love so the first thing i thought of when i saw this white and green colorway was that it's very similar to the previous ald collaboration except for obviously a few minor touches and since i don't own that ald pair this one was a very welcome addition to my collection diving straight into the details the base layer of the shoe this is constructed out of this smooth white leather so on the toe box you can see we have these two diagonal rows of perforations and overlaid on the edge of the toe box we have this asymmetrical cut of gray colored suede moving downwards on the lateral side we have 550 branding done in this green color and running down the length of the bottom of the shoe the leather here has this perforated finish to it looking at the shoe from an angle you can see underneath this white leather there's a secondary layer of green leather underneath and then next to this on the quarter panel we have the smooth white leather and then in the middle we have the new bounce and logo this is done in this green color and what feels like a synthetic almost vinyl-like material moving downwards we have more of that green leather covering the top portion of the ankle collar area and then beneath us we have this small hit of white colored nylon wrapping around the back heel we have more of that smooth white leather and we have the new balance logo stamped on in this green colored finish in the middle and then the top portion of the back of the heel this is padded in foam inside and it's lined with this white colored nylon wrapping around the bottom of the back heel we have this green colored tpu heel clip which gives you added structure and stability for the back end of the shoe at the base of the shoe right before the laces we have this small hit of green colored mesh and then next to this we have your laces which in this case is just your standard white colored flat lace underneath the laces we have your nylon tongue and at the very top we have this large tag with new bounds 550 branding done in this white and green finish and then the outer edge of the tongue is covered in this green colored nylon for the insoles these come with a very well padded very thick ortholite branded insole so we have one strip of foam that runs across the entire length of the shoe but then there's an additional layer of foam on the back heel which gives you added support and cushioning and as you can see it's lined in this green colored finish and we have the new bounds logo stamped on the heel in this white color so the upper of the new bounce 550 sits atop this white colored rubber cups we have both the new bounce word mark and the new bounce logo found on the lateral side and on the medial side you can see there's a sliver of exposed foam in the center turning the shoe over to the bottom so here we have your outsole which is done in this green colored rubber we have this very retro looking traction pattern found throughout and found on the back heel we have the new bounds word mark so that breaks down the look and the construction of these new bounce 550s so for those wondering about sizing so i'm a true size 10 slightly on the wider side and i'd recommend going with your normal new bounce size which in my case is a half size down so i got these in a nine and a half and they fit me well in a nice snug way and i feel like if you have narrow normal or slightly wide feet half size down should be good but if you have really wide feet then you might want to consider sticking true to size the 550 fits a little bit strange in that it's a little bit more forgiving and loose on the back heel and it's a little bit more narrow on the toe box so in my initial review of the 550 the ald pair a few years back my initial thoughts were that true to size was good but over time as i wore them and broke them in i found that true to size had just too much heel slippage and i found that going half size down just fit me a lot better over time especially after they've been broken in to give you guys a point of reference i also go with a nine and a half and other new bounce silhouettes like the 998 the 990 v3 v4 and v5 the 992 and the 993 but on the other hand i stick true to size in new balance models like the 997 the 1500 and the 1530. so hopefully that breakdown gives you some help in figuring out what size to get for the 550. moving on to comfort so this is a retro model from the 80s so with that said the comfort isn't going to be anything amazing but like i mentioned earlier there's a ton of cushioning in that ortholite insole so to be honest the majority of the comfort is coming from that insole and especially in the back heel there's a ton of plushness and cushioning still straight out of the box this shoe is a little bit stiff and it does require some breaking time but honestly in my personal experience the more you wear them the more you break them in and soften up the uppers they feel much better over time finally in terms of the overall quality and craftsmanship on this shoe so first off the material quality wasn't the best so this is obviously not a made in usa new balance and the material quality i'd say is definitely below average in terms of new balance standards so the leather has a bit of that stiffness to it and the suedes definitely didn't have that premium suede finish that a lot of new balances normally have however the overall build and craftsmanship on the shoe was spot on i had no issues from that standpoint and all things considered i'd say that this shoe is in line with my expectations given that the 550 seems to be treated by new balance as the gr of gr's in their portfolio with all that out of the way now let's lace these up and i'll show you guys how these green 550s look on feet overall i gotta say all three colorways they released the green the purple and the navy all three were beautiful and even though the quality isn't all there for the price point of 150 i still think this is a very worthy shoot a cop i think it's a very durable shoe as well especially if you're going to be wearing these every day for just casual use and especially if you missed out on the ald collaboration again this green pair comes very similar to the green alds so if you don't want to break the bank and drop a ton of money on resale you can definitely look to pick these up instead so let me know in the comment section down below what you guys think about this white and green new balance 550 between the green the purple and the navy how do you rank the three pairs and for those of you guys watching were you able to call any of the three or did you take an l or pass altogether if you guys like this video be sure to like comment and subscribe if you haven't yet you can follow me on instagram esco8 check me

1bOEo1jhSmQ,Nike Dunk Panda,what's up everybody it's shawn here and i'm back today to give you guys a review of the nike dunk glow in the white and black colorway this is one of those staple dunk colorways i've been releasing throughout 2021 and from what i heard they're gonna be restocking periodically throughout the year so this pair retails for a price of 100 us dollars or 135 dollars here in canada and the official color for this shoe is simply just white and black so last year in 2020 was the first year that nike really decided to push and promote the nike dunk silhouette once again and they released a handful of nike dunk glow colorways including the syracuse colorway the kentuckys and the brazils fast forward one year later to 2021 and nike has pretty much flooded the market with new colorways with the dunk low and i'm pretty sure this is my first non-sb and non-sort of limited colorway of the dunk low if we're not counting things like the city market colorway and the curry dunk lows so diving into the details of this shoe so the entire upper is constructed out of leather on the toe box we have this perforated white colored leather and then surrounding the outer edge we have this black leather i did want to point out though that the shape of the toe box is really nice really sloped and slanted and has this very tapered look to it this black leather covers the eyelets of the shoe and then beneath this on a quarter panel we have more that white leather overlaid on top for the nike swoosh this is constructed out of black leather and this black leather wraps around the back heel of the sneaker at the very top we have another hit of black leather and this time we have the nike word mark embroidered in white for the laces so they only come with one pair of laces and they're a flat style black colored lace underneath this we have your white colored nylon tongue and it's surrounded by this black colored nylon on the outer edges at the very top we have this tag which has nike branding in black and white for the insole so these come with your standard nike foam insole it's done in this white color and we have nike stamped on the heel in black so the upper of these dunk lows sits atop a solid white colored rubber midsole and then turning the shoe over to the bottom here we have your classic dunk outsole which in this case is constructed out of a black colored rubber we have the circular or radial style traction pattern on the forefoot along with the nike logo right in the center so for those wondering how these fit these fit pretty much like all my other nike dunks so for nike sportswear dunks i recommend sticking true to size so i'm a true size 10 my feet are slightly on the wider side and had zero issues fitting true to size with this model in terms of the comfort so these feel like all my other dunk glows so there's pretty much zero tech within the sneaker and the majority of the comfort is coming from the insole with that said though just for an everyday casual use shoe that i'm going to be beating around these feel perfectly fine they're not going to be exceptionally soft and cushioned but it's pretty much in line with the majority of your retro silhouettes from the 80s that have pretty much zero tech within it finally in terms of the overall quality and craftsmanship on this pair first off the material quality was pretty poor so when i compare this one to the 2020 versions like the university red and white the brazil's the kentucky's and syracuse the quality of the leather on those pairs absolutely destroys the quality on this one so for those pairs you can really feel like it's a genuine real leather whereas for this one especially the white leather it really feels hard and really plasticky so has this really strong synthetic feel to it the black leather was a little bit better it was a bit more soft compared to the white leather but honestly this white leather was atrocious and from an overall craftsmanship standpoint i said that it was okay it definitely wasn't perfect i had some issues with my pair but for a mass-produced gr dunk colorway it's pretty much in line with my expectations with all that being said now let's lace these up and i'll show you guys how these look on feet for me not just this colorway but i'd say all the gr dunk colorways i've released in 2021 i personally would not pay resale for them i've seen for example the syracuse dunk highs the quality on those ones are equally as bad as this one and i felt the same way about the women's coast colorway as well so for me these are definitely retail only and i feel like this white leather is gonna crease pretty bad so it's probably gonna be just a beater level sneaker so let me know in the comment section down below what you guys think about this nike dunk glow in this white and black colorway for those that have copped a pair of 20 21 dunks let me know in the comment section down below what you guys think about the overall quality look wise this looks really nice i love the tapered look of the toe and again the colorway is super wearable and versatile but unfortunately nike dropped the ball from a quality standpoint if you guys enjoyed this video be sure to like comment and subscribe give me a follow on instagram esko8 check out my twitter account at shawn.go and visit my website as well at seango.ca

4uPcwaezSuk,New Balance 2002R,what's up everybody it's shawn here back today tv it's another new balance review so today we'll be taking a look at the general release new balance 2002 r in this phantom and magnet colorway today's video is brought to you by heffalux hefflux is my all-time favorite sneaker insoles and they sell etpu insoles which essentially is the same material you'll find in adidas boost so if you're looking to add some additional comfort inside your shoes be sure to check out their website which i've linked down below in the description box you'll see they sell a variety of different insoles so depending on the type of insole density and the cushioning setup you're looking for you're gonna find there's a suitable insole for everyone so i've been a painting customer pefalux for years now and to me i personally find them to be very comfortable so if you guys want to check them out and try a pair for yourself be sure to use the code shawngo at checkout and get 15 off your entire purchase so i just want to give you guys a heads up the next few videos i'll be posting are all part of that same new balance 2002 art collection that we recently received here in canada so to put it bluntly it'll be pretty much the exact same video with the major difference between the pairs being of course the colors but for anyone sticking around watching all the videos i really really appreciate your love and support so this is the new balance 2002 are in the phantom and magnet colorway the style code is m2002 rho and these recently arrived here in canada on new balance.ca as well as some of our boutiques as well so these retail for 170 canadian dollars so i suspect when or if these arrived in the u.s they should retail for 140 usd and originally when these dropped a few months ago these are rumored to be maybe an asia exclusive but canada and now i believe europe as well received this so i'd be very surprised if these weren't a worldwide release so my initial thoughts when i got this in hand was that they look a lot lighter a lot more washed out and vintage than they look in pictures so i'm comparing this to the newbounce.ca stock photos where they look a lot more black but in real life the whole shoe is very faded and it's much more of a vintage looking dark gray so diving into the details the base layer of the shoe on the toe box this is covered in this dark gray colored mesh we have this reflective silver 3m right above this in the middle with the new balance and logo as well as on the medial edge and then overlaid on either side we have a very soft dark gray colored nubuck surrounding the front toe cap we have this brushed vintage looking suede and this same suede covers the mid panel of the shoe as well the top two eyelets are done in this tpu finish in this dark gray color and then underneath this we have the new bounce and logo which is constructed out of a reflective silver 3m panel with a sail colored leather underneath moving downwards surrounding the ankle collar area we have more of that same mesh that we saw earlier on the toe box and then we have this nubuck overlay on top with 2002 art braining found on the lateral side underneath this we have more of that suede which wraps around the back of the shoe and this bottom panel is perforated and then in the middle we have this triangular shape cutout revealing this tpu overlay with new balance branding and then the top of the heel is covered in another panel of reflective silver 3m as for the laces so these only come with one lace option and they're just your standard flat style lace done in a sale color underneath this the tongue is primarily constructed out of a mesh material but we have this dark grey colored nubuck overlay along with this washed out black suede at the very top and there's this oval shaped cutout on the top revealing the new bounds running branding in the center taking out the insoles these come with their standard foam line 2002 r insole and it's lined in a black colored textile on top and stamped on the heel of course we have new balance running branding so the upper of the 2002 r sits atop this absorb and absorb sps foam midsole the midsole is painted in this very vintage looking yellow color so it almost looks like this is a 30 year old shoe that's been kept in pristine condition in addition to the absorb and absorb sps they also incorporate new balance energy technology and this is visible on the lateral side of the heel with these gel like pillars which helps with impact protection and shock absorption and then turning the shoe over to the bottom here we have your outsole which is done in the solid dark gray colored rubber we have these flex grooves on the forefoot to give you added flexibility and then in the middle we have this vintage looking yellow color tpu plate which is what new balance calls their stability web technology and this helps with torsional rigidity and midfoot support so that breaks down the look and the construction of these 2002 r's and for those wondering about sizing to me these fit like most of my other 2002 rs so i would recommend sticking true to size so i'm a true size 10 slightly on the wider side i wear a size 10 in most of my 2002 rs and just to give you guys a point of comparison i also go a half size down in other new balance silhouettes like the 992 the 990 v3 v4 v5 most of my 550s and the 998 and in comparison i usually stick true to size or a size 10 in the 2002 r the 997 the 990 v2 because of its more narrow toe box along with a lot of the made in uk models like the 1500 the 991 and the 1530. moving on to the comfort so again i sound like a broken record but the 2002 r in my opinion is one of the most comfortable new balance shoes on the market it gives me that perfect balance of step and comfort with the foam underfoot while still being very stable and supportive so when i know i'm going to be standing on my feet for many hours in a day this is definitely a shoe i would recommend finally in terms of the overall quality and the craftsmanship so this is a made in china new balance shoe but the quality of the materials were great i thought the suedes felt very buttery the nubuck felt very high quality as well and in terms of the overall build there were some loose threads that i had to just trim off myself but other than that i thought it was very well put together really there were no major flaws that i could see so i was very pleased with this in hand so with all that out of the way now let me toss these on feet and i'll show you guys how these look while black and white shoes can normally be considered boring by some i really like how newbounds give us this vintage twist on this colorway how they treated the suede giving it that really worn in look i thought it was a very nice touch and then to add to that whole aesthetic they gave us this vintage looking midsole which i thought really complemented the upper well and evidently it seems like the people agree with me as well because most sizes of this specific colorway have sold out whereas the other ones are mostly sitting on the website so clearly this phantom and magnet colorway is doing something right so let me know in the comment section down below what you guys think but this phantom and magnet new balance 2002 are what are your overall thoughts on this specific colorway are you feeling this whole vintage worn-in vibe to it or are you not a big fan of the vintage look and you prefer more of a true black color if you

covers like they just took the uh out of the off the imagery I I wish they were adhesive or something but they don't seem to be adhesive they are just like an acrylic and it's just sort of celebrating like all those albums and corn and and all that good stuff here's a better view of like those different album covers just chopped out you know it's the brand with three stripes breaking news alert breaking news alert we just figured out what these do so all right let's get this uh figured out and show you guys what's up real quick going to have to get this lace out of my way first if you look closely you're going to find this little panel right here and how it separates a little bit and you know in looking at the three stripes they're pretty thick and they're pretty thick acrylic show you that separation again all right so each shoe kind of comes with there you know different things here these uh different album cover artwork that we were talking about earlier all right see just how easy this is to do let's check it out boom so we just changed the uh Adidas corn Superstar kind of giving it like a whole new a whole new life with that different color three stripe they give you you know the green gold just the uh images kind of Stamped Out off the album covers that looks tight man it changes the shoe up quite a bit so anyway that's what's up you guys we have this like kind of like a chameleon type insert to where you can actually change the three stripes so that's what's up um this one on the left shoe it also comes with a guitar pick one side Adidas the other side corn uh by now you probably are picking up on that the three stripes is uh EST 1994 that's kind of an interesting coincidence cuz Southside skatepark is also celebrating 30 years of Southside skat Park so yeah established 1994 uh it has its own unique Superstar tooling and font with a backwards R uh kind of corn lettered essentially hopefully you can see that nicely so there's like a weird intelligence report coming in the corn was actually started in '93 um so 94 I don't know what's going on with that um maybe the band kind of changed up or some members of the band changed up in those years uh they are laced with the you know the fat laces it is that shell toe um we've got corn and Adidas on the heels we have a nice embroidered corn on the tongue and then Adidas on the right foot um underneath we're in like a EST 1994 in red embroidery underneath the tongue and that is on both shoes it has like a really nice gum tread uh probably just a little bit softer than the typical like white gum that is usually the Superstar build um yeah kind of rad uh the leather feels nice uh let's see here in regards to the laces we have a black lace we also have an alternate red lace so we're going to get into those as well hey you guys real quick while I was working on these laces I noticed that the insole had a print to it so this would be their first album This Album debuted in October 11th of 1994 so that might be the established you know 1994 we're seeing on the three stripe kind of just commemorate their first album kind of dropping at that time um I wonder if there's like a there was a big event or something that happened on October 11th this year uh I don't know um what's really interesting too is that K actually just played here in Houston like this like days ago I think it was Sunday night um but yeah corn just came through Houston and uh thought that was crazy but what's tough about it is like we aren't able to like even put out anything um until October 25th so couldn't really say anything about it even though corn was literally in town so let me get these uh the red lace and the black lace in for you guys so you can see those options and I'll be right back we are back with the lace swap here is the uh corn Superstar from Adidas in with a red lace the fat lace that they would have rocked for the last 30 years and then here we have it in with the black lace she looks pretty sick in hand and uh I kind of definitely like the red laces a little better than the uh White laces or the or the black laces I think it looks really really good with the red lace boom so if you're super into corn and maybe you've been running to D Shell Toes or you were considered like a corn kid um here it is right another thing I kind of noticed when I was messing with this was that the aglets on all the laces kind of give you that EST 1994 yeah um so yeah these are going to release for Halloween 10:31 uh this year celebrating 30 years of corn uh they've been wearing nothing but Adidas for 30 years they may have you know really got a lot of people into Adidas and into Adidas shos in particular um if you're liking this content make sure you like follow subscribe comment below um this is definitely like a different show for us to be reviewing like a corn Adidas collab uh Superstar and so I'm definitely curious as to what the comments are going to say so I'm going to bring this uh shoe in for some more details I really appreciate you guys watching um and subscribing and just being down and just all your comments and everything uh how do they fit uh the whole TR to tr to

fPCtUlAdT8U,Vans Old Skool,what's up everybody welcome back to the Southside skatepark YouTube channel where we review products before they're coming out as they're coming out and sometimes even after they've come out today I have a new style of Footwear from Vans and this is the skate old school 36 it's coming out in two colors it's releasing in January 29th first color is going to be antique white black antique white black and the second color is going to be the black Navy it'll be the black Navy um yeah so let's get into it let's check these out new shoe from Vans bam busting these out for you real quick all right just out of the uh box here it's looking like an old school but just a little bit different it's going to have some eyelets some metal eyelets uh nice thick flat lace it's got like a little kind of tongue pull little heel pull um Loops which is pretty tight the tongue is uh it's got a lot more puff to it so there's like more protection for the board chop we've got kind of a kind of a lightweight breathable uh mesh material here the suede is coming down and then it's really kind of actually sent pretty far back a lot of times uh some of the shoes you know it just seems to be like the protective suedes or layered materials aren't really actually where the flick is on this shoe it actually seems like it is which is great toe box is kind of tripping me out the toe box has just seems so short you know the more I look at the shoe and the more I'm around the shoe kind of the less that that sort of uh kind of bothers me or whatever um yeah so I'm going to bring it in for some details check it out this is the van style 36 this is an antique white black pretty clean shoe it's going to come with a pop cush insole it's got your waffle cup since 66 this um pull tab they've just like opted to pull that material all the way down the tongue behind the laces this is going to have a pretty clean black Jazz stripe I do like the red piping hit let's get into the interior of the shoe a little bit all right it has the the elastic uh tongue tongue kind of tongue straps that sort of strap that tongue into place and keep it like perfectly on your foot I'm going to bust out this insole for you guys in case you've never seen one of these this is the difference between just Vans and vans skate okay so in uh Vans skate pretty much everything in our Shop's going to have the pop cush insole it's going to be a little more comfortable protect your heel protect your forefoot give you just a little bit of something the things from like that are just like Vans Classics uh they're not quite this raw but they are are like just such a thin just piece of mesh and there are people who like that they like the way their foot sits that low behind the midsole taping this is a vulcanized shoe so it's going to have you know the waffle cup wrapped in a vulcanized tape adhering the the sole or the tread to the upper with the gluing and taping process this um midsole it seems just ever so slightly higher and and we're talking probably MIM from a normal uh Vans old school the Vans old school kind of side by side with this I bet looks pretty thin in a way or more reduced more minimal let me just kind of re repack the shoe real quick underneath the tongues it has this Vans world's number one skateboarding shoe yeah they're just kind of taking the old school and giving it a bit of puff you know giving it a bit of more ump to all aspects of the silhouette it does read a little different it definitely reads like more like plump has the uh on the back you know the way they've continued this uh little pull Loop down the tongue it comes straight up the back of the heel gives you a loop kind of pop them on this I believe that this should be a single panel of suede around the heel it has the uh Vans flag rubber stamp little skateboard the way they launched this shoe was the carpet Vans collab when the style 36 came out this morning uh it blew out sold out congratulations carpet congratulations Vans awesome collaboration H to sell out uh on the new silhouette I think that's great it kind of helps establish the style 36 to the public and just make them aware of it there is sort of like kind of like I'm not sure exactly what to call this material and I'm sure there's a name for it so comment below uh in the comments here at Southside skateparks YouTube channel and if you're liking the content like follow subscribe ring the bell do your thing we're also Southside htx on Instagram I'm Big O owner of Southside skatepark bringing you this review I always want to review anything kind of definitely new if it's new I want to talk about it um so yeah this uh kind of soft material I kind of It kind of felt like it's not it's not a it's not a towel and it's not satin and it's just sort of just a nice soft sock liner maybe give you a little grip between like sock to shoe so your so your heels not coming out of there I believe they fit pretty true to size uh this month we were working with John Bera in filming like a little style 36 uh promotional project here in Houston uh featuring The Shoe John peria and uh the skate park as well so I hope you're enjoying that footage uh I guess let's check that out right now [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] all right sick I hope you like that edit super stoked for John and I appreciate Vance for giving us the opportunity let's get into the next colorway so once again this was the antique white black a good looking shoe uh this thing is going to MSRP for uh $ 79.9 all right here comes the other colorway uh this is going to be the black uh STV Navy I'm not exactly sure what STV Navy is I don't even know if I should know what that is STV Navy so hey vans vans staff you guys comment below let me know STV Navy is what what's it mean comment below thank you all right so this thing once again this shoe uh MSRP is for $79.95 this is the second colorway it has a lot of the features well all the features of the first colorway I showed you just some color changes I didn't kind of comment on the pull tab having like a checkerboard uh print in uh ink a lot of times we see that on uh V VCU product uh VCU is like a the brand Vans has a a retail partner segmentation called VCU and if you're on the VCU program you have access to some of the most elevated products that Vans is making within the skate uh lineage and that's kind of an awesome thing so we're stoked to be a part of it I don't know if these I I wouldn't say these are VCU though the carpet van certainly were let's see what else is going on there's that short toe box again but in Black maybe it looks a little bit different to you here we have that like breathable kind of lightweight uh mesh material it's also very durable with a black Jazz stripe the uh metal eyelets the heel pull uh we have Navy running down kind of dissecting the black heel cup kind of suede right there of course they have the Vans pop cush insole and white flat laces the shoe is clean has that red piping around the tongue nice and it's got a nice puff to it um and yeah if you're looking for like an old school that's a little more large on the foot this is it you know I kind of feel like these are kind of focused at a new kind of emerging fashion that's going on I'm seeing I'm seeing cropped t-shirts I'm seeing baggy pants right well kind of baggy as they've been really they're not getting skinnier they're not getting uh bigger um I'm kind of seeing them getting cut sometimes Shin high like high water or just Norm Al and I think that Sho is kind of the compliment a lot of that a lot of that exaggerated look that we're seeing in fashion right now from like the Young Folks so anyway here comes the shoe some details for you check it out shoe is sick Navy black white lace has that piping around the tongue nice fat tongue that short toe box which I don't hate I mean it just just seems a little shorter probably because there's so much tongue kind of pack packed in in there let me show you these heels here's a little overhead looking down on the shoe and yeah that's what's up the shoes releasing January 30th uh both colorway they're releasing at South sides skateshop.com they'll be $79.95 they're both really good colorways this one might be for someone who just wants to keep it clean this one might be for someone who knows they kind of thrash their shoes pretty hard and kind of buy a darker colored shoe so it's not like jacked up so quickly as John was skating his this month for the van style 36 feature that we shot I kind of noticed how the laces were kind of fraying and stuff but I think they just look better skated and I hope you guys saw that in the edit once again congratulations vans on a new shoe in your line style 36 pulled from a lot of the original old school Inspirations I think the shoe turned out rad we'll see how far it goes we'll see how it performs over the coming months and uh glad to be a part of it so if you like this content subscribe follow ring the bell I'm Big O here at Southside skate park and you're watching the Southside skate park

b71FkqKzcX0,ASICS GEL-LYTE III,what's up everybody welcome back to the soul break thanks for stopping by my channel so today i have a very special uh pair of a6 and these are the a6 gel light 3 og in collaboration with a few in the beauty of imperfection colorway so apparently um this derives its motivation from the wabi-sabi philosophy i'm gonna i'm not gonna try to act like i know what that means but when i looked it up it apparently it's uh supposed to mean that you know you know we keep moving towards like searching the beauty of imperfection and that's as far as i'm gonna try to explain it but i mean if you know anything more about that please feel free to leave something down below in the comment sections i really would like to know but anyways uh this is a very beautiful pair of sneakers and they released quite recently and i was able to cop a pair in my size they actually sold out originally and then a few pairs restocked so i kind of grabbed the restock pair because i really really wanted to see this pair in hand when i first saw it online so without further ado let's dive right into the shoe so this is the uh gel light 3 silhouette and i believe it's one of the most uh popular and classic silhouettes in the a6 line and i believe um sean witherspoon did a collab with this particular silhouette a few years back and and after he left uh you know his partnership with nike so you know it is a very special model um for the a6 brand and as you can see the overall tone of the shoe is very very calm and peaceful and it's really really an eye candy piece in my opinion so on the side you've got the typical asics kind of like cross stripe detail all done in this kind of like jade green leather and i can tell you that the leather itself is a bit tumbled in texture and it is very smooth to the touch the the cut itself is quite thick and you can see almost like a light pinkish shoe or even like a beige hue on the side of the cut and for some reason that jade color is really really uh mesmerizing uh in my opinion and below that crisscross detail you've got a nice side panel all done in this i would say like a sort of like a greenish uh grayish kind of toned uh suede material once again the material itself is very very smooth and you know it seems like a6 does use a lot of uh premium materials on their collab models and i really really appreciate that effort from the brand and you can see that the entire side panel is well perforated so that's going to give you a lot of breathability when you wear these in the summertime and then on top of that you've got another ever so darker shade of that greenish gray color uh panel here as an overlay on the side i guess you could call that a mud guard or whatever and that lines the entire bottom part of the side here and that that sort of material extends all the way towards the front where you can see the toe cap is constructed in that same material once again it's very smooth and you can see some sort a slight color change when i uh run my thumb across it and once again the toe box is done using that lighter shade of that greenish grayish suede material and you can see a lot of perforated holes so that you can right off the bat you can know that this is a very breathable shoe and on the center you got the uh a very similar toned cotton laces the flat laces factory laced onto the shoe and underneath that you got a nice thick suede tongue here that typical asics jelly three tongue where you got the split middle down the uh you know down on the center so that's going to give you a lot of comfort when you wear these they're very probably wearable when you just kind of you can so you can kind of like slide your feet in there and then um for the sock liner you got this nice um i could say like a cotton sock liner done in a very similar color as the the the outer material as you can see uh side to side can't really tell the difference between the tones there and then what's interesting is that you got the uh the cork insole with the a6 text logo printed in black now i do like the look of cork insoles but my experience with the cork insoles haven't been that great particularly because i'm not sure if you guys are familiar with an air max 90 model called like was it type b or whatever it was basically a white and yellow lemon yellow kind of air max 90 uh kind of mimicking the you know the cassette tape details and then that had a cork insole and for some reason i don't know maybe it was because i wore that in the summertime the cork insole is very very um sticky let's just put it that way it's really hard to move your feet around inside the shoe not that you have to it's just that your feet kind of feel stuck inside the shoe if you know what i mean so i'm guessing that would probably be the same experience with this i haven't put this pair on foot just yet uh but that's just what i'm imagining but you know it's probably different for everybody but that's just the general feel that i have toward cork insoles but again it's very nice detail and it's really cool to look at back returning to the the back side of the sneaker you got a nice overlay of this very very light purple um i would say like a dusty purple kind of suede material with the stitching detail here along the borderline and again this material is really really smooth and then you see the uh the gel light 3 text logo debossed into that kind of purple overlay and then it's i guess the text itself is done in this kind of like cream colored uh paint or whatever and then on the uh the back side the heel counter i think this is one of the coolest parts of the shoe so here towards the the collar area i guess you are the heel counter excuse me the heel tab you got this nice uh fabric material i guess it's some sort of like canvas material done in that i would say like some army green or olive green colored and then you got the a few text embroidered in black for those of you who don't know a few is a boutique store that you know sells a lot of sneakers and clothings and then you got a chinese character in the mid part on top of a sort of like beige or sale colored actually no my camera is picking up a very different tone but when you look at it it almost has like a grayish tone to it so you got that chinese character debossed into the shoe in black i'm not going to even attempt to read what that means but for those of you can good for you and then here on the medial side it's basically the same uh same deal except for the fact that the a6 the stripe detail the crisscross detail is done in this kind of like i would say like a violet type of you know um stitching across the side panel and also the side panel is missing that you know the perforated holes across it so yeah and then the midsole i'm guessing this is just basically uh eva foam uh and then it's done in this very very uh rich cream or sale color uh material and then you got the asics text logo here on the side and then the bottom is a very beautiful gum outsole with the typical traction pattern that we see on any other gel light 3 model and then you got the asics text logo branded on the mid part here as well and then the other shoe is basically the same deal nothing too crazy here and just check i think okay so yeah the chinese characters are different on the back side but i'm not really sure what it means i'm not going to try to attempt to read it as i was saying but for those of you know please feel free to leave something down below in the comments sections uh we would really like to know what it means but anyways uh that's basically it and sizing wise i'll be honest i haven't ever tried a pair of gel light threes so i can't really offer a good sizing tip but what i generally feel about asic's shoes is that they do tend to run a bit smaller i'm guessing it's because asics is a japanese brand and i think asian brands tend to have smaller um sizing compared to say like you know the european brands or american brands but that's just my thought and you might be you might be safe going maybe half size up or even just true to size but i wouldn't go like half a size down or anything like that and wearability wise this is a very very clean and simply toned shoe uh you can say that you know the purple looks wild or whatever but you know it's very muted and toned down enough that you won't have any trouble wearing these with your daily outfit uh it won't really i mean you probably get a lot of compliments for this shoe because it's the color way is very very subtle and it's just so mesmerizing when you see these in hand uh resale wise i don't think there's any like resale premium on these right now actually i just checked on stockx and it seems like the uh the purchase bids are even going below retail so if you really like this pair and if you don't own a pair of like gel light threes this might be a really really good pickup for you um especially because you know they're just widely available right now um so it's it's it's a pretty uh good addition to your collection but anyways um that's basically it for today i hope you guys enjoyed watching this video and if you enjoyed watching this video please hit that subscribe button it really really helps my channel grow and i have some other shoes waiting to be reviewed in my room so stay tuned for more and thanks for watching,2025-06-23 14:47:22.723559 UTC

-JM_uaunNGo,Vans Old Skool,what's up guys in this video i'll be comparing and reviewing the vans old school and the vans ward to see which sneaker you should buy let's get drop my what's up boss clan welcome back to another episode of kicking it with kage and in this video i got another sneaker comparison for you guys between the vans old school and the vans ward so if you're ready to pick up a van sneaker but you're not really sure which one to cop then this video is for you so i'll be comparing these two sneakers on the five most important aspects that is important to your purchasing decision and these are price quality style fit and durability and at the end we'll see which one you should call but before we get started if you guys are new to my channel i'm sauce cogging and i focus on helping you guys level up your style game so if you're into sneaker unboxings reviews and comparison make sure you guys subscribe and turn on the notification bell so you guys don't miss out on any fresh ass new videos all right let's get started with the comparison starting with price so both the vans old school and the vans award are both going for 60 which is a really great and affordable price for these sneakers making them super accessible for skating and wearing them as the dopest street wear sneakers hence making them a fan favorite so since they are the same price i'm gonna have to give both of them one point each moving on to quality those sneakers are made with canvas and suede uppers and have great quality outsoles for grip if you're skating as well as both have that iconic jazz stripe along the side so both are made with awesome quality so i'm about to give both of them one point each moving on to style so starting with the similarities both have that classic van silhouette and have the vans off the wall tag at the back of each shoe as for differences the ward has advanced tag on the tongue whereas the old school doesn't also the ward has stitching above the jazz stripe whereas the old school has the stitching on the jazz stripe also another difference is the vans old school has stitching below the jazz stripe while the ward doesn't as for the ankle the ward has a wide gap stitch and the old school has a narrow stitch also the ward has a black insole whereas the van's old school has a cream insole as for the outsole the ward has a darker brown and the old school has a lighter brown or tan color as for the ankle support the ward has a much thinner cushioning and support system whereas the old school has a much thicker ankle support and the last difference is the ward has stitching that goes into the toe box whereas the old school has stitching that goes behind the tow bar so the sneakers are very identical with only small detail differences however i do like the details of the old school and the fact that it doesn't have a tag making it look a little bit cleaner so i'm gonna have to give a point to the old school but if you guys are loving the comparison so far make sure you guys are smashing that like button moving on to the fifth gold sneakers are made to fit wide and both are super comfortable and you can walk in them or skate in them for hours however like i said before the vans old school has extra cushioning around the ankle providing extra support and cushioning for skating while also providing a narrower opening around the ankle so because i don't skate or need the extra cushioning i'm gonna have to give the point to the ward moving on to durability gold sneakers can take a lot of wear and tear and will last a long time as your beater or skate shoe so i'm going to give both sneakers 1.8 and at the end the vans old school and the vans award gets a tie with 4 pointy making both of them gopass sneakers but if you do skate i do recommend you to go with the vans old school as the extra ankle support will benefit you when you're skating but if you just want to rock the sneakers with your fits you can honestly grab either or as there's only small detail differences so whichever goes on sale just cough one of them and you'll be good fam all together the vans old school and the vans award are amazing sneakers being super comfortable and affordable and of course adding the right kind of sizzle to your fists and is an essential to your sneaker rotation and that's it for the comparison,2025-06-23 14:38:22.713462 UTC
9a8XG8Sc3hE,Stan Smith,what's up guys in this video i'll be reviewing and comparing the adidas dan smiths and adidas superstars to see which one you should buy all coming up right now gentlemen the stan smiths and the superstars are adidas best-selling and most iconic sneakers as they've been a cult classic for decades i mean just look at them they're fresh as hell boy the question is if i had to choose one which one would i choose and why so that's what i'll be answering in this video so i'll be comparing these two sneakers on price quality style fit and durability and at the end i'll give you guys the verdict on which sneaker comes out on top and is the one you should buy all right let's begin with the price starting with the stan smith so the adidas stan smith is going for 85 usd and 110 canadian whereas the adidas superstars are going for 85 usd as well and 100 canadian meaning they're the same price in the states but for some reason they're ten dollars more in canada i don't know my boys however i've seen both sneakers go on sale from time to time so you guys gotta watch out for those deals all right let's move on to quality so the stan smiths are made with the vegan prime green uppers which is made from high performance recycled materials and according to their website 50 of the upper is recycled content which is amazing my boys and the outsole is made from rubber waist as well as having a synthetic lining so as you guys can see it's a very eco-friendly sneaker as for the superstars the superstars are made with full grain leather uppers for comfort as well as providing better resistance against scuffs and scratches the shoe also has a mesh lining for breathability and they make your feet feel nice and comfy my boys there's also a padded heel collar for that plush feel and a signature rubber toe cap for that classic superstar look and enhance durability and last it has a rubber cup sole with a herringbone tread pattern for durability and traction so if you're a green eco-conscious person the stan smith is probably the choice for you as it supports green initiatives but if you want a more premium look and feel the superstars are a great choice alright let's move on to the style so this stan smith is the all-white version having a very clean and simple silhouette having the signature stan smith's logo on the tongue and heel tab and they also have that perforated stripes along the sides moving on to the superstars the superstars has that classic three-stripe branding on each side of the shoe at the midfoot as well as having the adidas tree foil branding on the tongue and heel plus having the superstars branding on the lateral sides and of course having the signature rubber toe cap for style and durability so in regards to style i would say the stan smith is the perfect sneaker if you want something simple and to put more of an emphasis on your outfit whereas the superstars are better if you want to dress more simple creating a higher emphasis on the shoe and before we move on to the fit of the sneakers if you guys are taking in a lot of value make sure you guys are smashing that like button my boys all right let's move on so for the stan smiths they do feel larger providing a lot of room they are super comfortable as that's why a lot of people use them for their daily shoes however if you want a more snug feel i'll recommend you to go a half size down but it's always best to try them on before you buy them boys as for the superstars they do fit larger providing a lot of room and fit more snug compared to the stan smiths in regards to the width and i think this gives the superstars an edge in regards to arch support and i would also recommend you to go a half size down as well so for me i prefer the fit of the stan smiths as it just fits more roomier and feels more comfortable to me let's move on to durability so both sneakers will definitely last a long time in your wardrobe my boys and even though i'm in support for green and sustainable initiatives based on the feel and the material used in the superstars i definitely think the superstars will last longer than the stan smiths alright let's move on to the verdict boys the stan smith and the superstars are amazing sneakers having been a classic for decades for streetwear and men's fashion enthusiasts however if i had to choose one i would definitely go for the stan smiths as i prefer a more simple silhouette due to the sneaker complementing my outfits better so if you dress more casual or want to put a higher emphasis on your outfit then i would definitely recommend you to go for the stan smiths and if you dress more streets or typically dress simple and want to put an emphasis on your sneakers then the superstars are definitely for you and guys that's it for this adidas dan smith's versus a superstars comparison,2025-06-19 08:39:29.617755 UTC
HSItfjSwrEA,Adidas Gazelle,what's up guys issue boy Christian here back at super Sneaky talked with a brand new sneaker review and today we're taking a look at an all-time classic Adidas sneakers these right here these are the adidas Originals gazelle the adidas gazelle and this is probably one of the most iconic Adidas sneakers to date besides the likes of the adidas campus and the adidas superstar and as of lately of course BND is the ultra boost eases the Pharrell's but yeah you know you get it you get it alright if you're looking for just like a casual sneaker to wear every single day the adidas Gazelle is definitely something I can recommend to the retail price of 79 US dollars or a hundred and ten canadian dollars because i was definitely an affordable retro sneaker and if you're frugal and if you're hunting enough you will be able to find pairs of gazelles on sale this is a sneaker that frequently ends up uh places like Marshalls and Ross and winners and of course the adidas outlets so if you really like the sneaker I would recommend checking out the outlet or right now if you are listen for a pair I'll leave links to copies in the description down below not just the right colorway I'll also have other colorways that might be on sale and there's also a big spring break or March Break sale on the adidas websites right now so click the links in the description down below if you guys want to save some money on some three strikes I think it's so awesome that this is a sneaker that came out in 1991 and it's still just as stylish as it is now as it was back then this sneaker goes with everything it goes well with jeans it sort of goes well with the joggers and it's a sneaker that looks good with shorts I don't really like to wear shorts very often but when I do I have a lot of high-top sneakers so when it comes to picking a low top sneaker for the summer that gazelle is definitely a sneaker I turn to very often and also if you aren't as fan I'll be suede or the new buck uppers of the gazelle there are also some crimenet versions available if you're a high feast or if you just want to find a more expensive gazelle to buy neighborhood recently did a collaboration with adidas on these and they made them with a black primeknit upper but the retail price is 250 Canadian or 200 u.s. so it's probably one of the most expensive gazelles today let's take a look at this sneaker what makes this sneaker what is it the Gazelle features a pigskin nubuck upper it's really really soft to the touch it is a material isn't very rain friendly so if you are going to wear these make sure you're not gonna get caught in the rain you might want to spray them with some waterproof spray some suede or some new bug spray just to prevent them from getting destroyed in the rain but if you're in a pretty dry climate that doesn't have a lot of rain this sneaker is something you can just throw on your feet any day and not have to worry about it now besides the pigskin nubuck upper there is also some white leather straps going down the side of the shoe you guys also see that rolled in gazelle imprinted onto the side of the shoe really nice touch I love the fact that it's gold sneakers do come with red laces there's like deep deep red laces they don't come with any extra laces unfortunately they also have a white tongue right here going down the very center of the shoe and there's also the red adidas trefoil logo with the adidas branding underneath the tongue is also always so you guys can see it's all white the contrast is there I really really like this tongue it's sort of aerodynamic and sort of gives it a sort of athletic aesthetic to it so if you are into sports if you're into soccer like myself I feel like this kind of sneaker is something you'll like more then say something like the adidas campus now I believe this campus is also an awesome retro sneaker I would recommend you guys look into you might find colorways of this sneaker that doesn't exist for this shoe in color is an issue that doesn't exist for this either way say gazelle and the campus are two sneakers that live in the same realm in the adidas universe so you might want to look into the campus as well I'll leave my review for these in the description down below but with that said these are the recent mid green colorway that just drop the ankle color of the shoe uses this white synthetic leather all around it's really soft and it feels great on feet you don't have to worry about it really digging into your ankles which is I know something that some people might have issues with the other sneakers there's also the white insole with the red adidas branding and then spinning it around over to the bootie of the shoe you got that famous red adidas logo on the back the outsole is white too with a sort of like waffle kind of pattern going on now in terms of sizing and concert for the adidas Gazelle I would recommend going half a size down or your true size I find that in going half a size down in these retro and neatest models or something I do pretty often so if you were looking for a pair then try them on in store if you really want to get into your right size but I always go half the size that's just me besides that the overall comfort is really solid it's an average adidas retro sneaker they didn't implement too much technology into this shoe so if you have long long days of walking around and just going all over the place non-stop the gazelle is something I probably wouldn't recommend to you so if you're just doing some general walking throughout the day or if you're just looking for a sneaker to wear at school or if you're just in a city urban environment you're sitting down for some points at the time as well I don't think is L it's something I would look into it that's gonna be my review of the adidas gazelle let me know what you guys think about these sneakers in the comment section down below are these sneakers a cop are they a drop do you own a pair do you know anybody who owns it here because it's a very very popular sneaker but with that said I can't I can't review these shoes without showing you guys what they look like on speed so I'll throw them on feet and I'll catch you guys in the next video by the way links in the description for the shoe along with the crazy adidas March Break sale alright that's it catch you guys next time peace out just trying to strike oh she try to strike oh we just trying to strike go I'm just trying to strike oh yeah go like the place I might even die like my chair me Scout wings that I in the screen just trying to eat yeah so both keep up you just won't be,2025-06-23 14:38:57.975956 UTC
PqeoYaf4-cQ,Vans Old Skool,what's up guys it's your boy Kristian here back at you for sneaker talk with a brand new sneaker review and today we are taking a look at a pair of sneakers that is probably one of the most popular sneakers in the world the vans old-school now just a disclaimer these aren't just a regular pair of vans old schools these are a DX version which is just a fancy way of saying these are the more premium advanced old schools that use better quality materials and I also got these in Japan so these do have a checkered tongue while every other pair out there has just the regular blacktop but regardless of the DX branding and the upped in quality materials this is a vans old school at heart now in the United States these sneakers retail for a price of particular dollars and in Canada the price of $80 now the thing with the vans all school is you can easily easily find them on sale these are on sale everywhere the only times you would really have to pay full price for a pair of vans old schools is if there's a brand new pattern that just released that you happen to be in love with but if you look around places like little burgundy or Urban Outfitters or PacSun or West 49 or even at the vans outlet where I would recommend you go you'll find them on sale for pretty cheap for example these right here these retails for about $60 u.s. in the States but if he goes to the Vans L that you might be able to find them for $40 and buy one get one half price bands outlets always seem to have buy one get one half price promotions so it's definitely worth checking out if you guys want to see what a vans outlet is like I will leave two vlogs linked down below where we go to them where you can see how cheap bands can be so there's a couple of reasons why the Vans old-school is incredibly incredibly popular the first one being its price alone and a $60 price point I mean if you find a pair that you like and you're not you know living super frugal you can easily cop them without making twice it's a very easy to wear sneaky or something you can throw on pretty much any day and it goes with anything you can just wear the black pair and you'll be fine but of course there's other colorways like red and green and yellow there's just so many other colorways available which is reason number two they have availability and colorways this sneaker can be found pretty much anywhere so many retail stores carry this shoe and they carry them in a million different colorways and because they do there might be a color you like that someone else doesn't which ends up on sale because it's just been sitting in the store for a while reason number three as to why the Vans old school is so popular is its durability these are actually pretty durable sneakers for the price you're paying keep in mind the manufactured retail price for the shoe is sixty US dollars and this is a shoe that can easily get you by eight to twelve months so you won't have to replace them super super frequently and reason number four reason number four is definitely not the Comfort it's not the most comfortable sneaker in the world I would recommend throwing in an extra pair of insoles one thing to note with the DX versions like this there is an upgraded insole it's called the ultra cush technology it's a more spongy kind of feel so if you do find a pair of bands DX's that you really like I would recommend you get them if you want to make them your daily beater but I think a fourth reason why these are so popular is their ease ability to clean these are really really easy to clean sneakers they don't require insane amounts of sneaker cleaning product I mean if you have the cleaning product it makes it easier but look at this you got a simple white midsole a quick little scrub and wipe of the midsole and it looks pretty much brand new the laces you can throw in a washer and dryer and make those look brand new and so they get really really dirty the material is a canvas material so it's pretty forgiving when you clean it with a brush or anything of that nature so it's gonna be easy to maintain but again if you wear the vans everyday is your daily beater most people don't tend to clean them very often so I would recommend you at least clean your vans once a month if you want to keep them looking fresh the band's old schools have regular colorways like the blacks the whites the greens the Reds there's also colorways like this the checkered boards and there's also other prints available like cougar print for example and sometimes there's also some special collaborations out there as well with that said do I recommend this sneaker absolutely if you're looking for a decent sneaker on a budget that is flexible and easy to wear every single day and goes with most outfits then the band's old-school is something you might want to cop and probably in the black-and-white colorway just because it's the easiest to wear every day anyways in terms of sizing I would recommend going your true size on a size 10 in most of my sneakers and is no exception with that said I'm gonna get going but I can't show you guys these sneakers and review them without throwing them on feet so let's step outside real quick after them on feet and I'll catch you guys in the next video think about subscribing if you're new and of course if you haven't yet seen my Japan vlogs playlist I'll leave them linked down below I actually bought these in Japan Japan actually has a lot of cool exclusive colorways if you are into bands it is a Vance paradise so I'm going back next month make sure you guys watch those vlogs and yeah I'll catch you guys in the next video on beef coming up,2025-06-23 14:38:25.307307 UTC
QNqm1RTTI5c,Onitsuka Mexico 66,what's up guys it's your boy derky Chan today I'm just going to do a quick review of The onisuka Tiger shoe the box and everything so here we go we got the Mexico 66 that's the label I got the white and black/ navy pair yes I have small feet don't clown me just kidding guys this is a pair for my partner she got these today so this is the box when you open it you get the shoe there it is only secet I did a previous video with my cousin Donnie's shoe and my partner liked it so much she got her Navy and black one I think this one's better for everyday wear I'll go over the details of this shoe and tell you whether or not it's worth the price now if you could get it for retail get it for retail but you're looking at about 150 you know if you get these shoes for a 100 bucks that'd be great but since these are so hot right now it's going to be hard and for 150 I would say it's a bit much I mean when you're paying 150 that's getting into like basketball shoes slash performance running shoe territory you get a lot of technology in those shoes and these shoes they're good looking good materials 150 is kind of pushing it but my counter argument ment is it's worth it if you use it a lot so 150 won't mean anything if you use this shoe every single day it comes out to be about couple cents if you use it every day and can this shoe last every day just based off my initial impression it's a very well-built shoe it's sturdy the stitching and construction is very well done all throughout the shoe the bottom sole is very tough as well so this will handle lot of wear and tear and the leather is very flexible I don't see this cracking or having any holes develop in them even in the pinky area it's a very well reinforced here so the material the leather on this very nice very soft and supple nice suede now the inside the same kind of materials you got the leather with a little bit of padding in there very nice shoe and on the inside very comfortable my partner says that there's this arch support right here that feels really good when you walk on it overall cushioning it's a lot better than most shoes you're looking at like something around the comfort of a Air Force One one from Nike slightly better it does have a harder Soul so don't expect a lot of energy return but it's a classic sneaker but yeah very quality built shoe the stitching on this is immaculate I looked over this shoe and the stitching is so spoton all over even on the logo the back it's a beautiful shoe so overall very good quality shoe not bad for 150 very stylish too Quality quality shoe here's the back tab tiger ra just quality materials and my partner says because they put the soft leather here it doesn't dig into your heel so there's not a lot of breaking time it's very soft you just put it on you can walk a whole day in in it won't bother you so yeah we're going to do the onfit right now on shoe fit and yeah show you how these shoes look but a great quality shoe decent Comfort great style very stylish shoe decent amount of comfort decent price all right guys onto the onfit let's go forgot to mention the bottom tread pattern of this shoe it's actually very grippy we've only worn this shoe inside the house my partner has still yet to wear this outside just because this is such a clean pristine shoe she doesn't want to ruin it yet but this traction pattern indoors is immaculate she feels so grippy and low to the floor she can run in these things all right guys on to the outfit all right guys here's the anuku on feet as you can see very nice low profile shoe great design overall now my partner says these do fit true to size for the most part with a little bit room on the toe up here she's a size eight in Air Forces and she went with a size eight in the only Su tiger as well look how beautiful that leather just molds to her feet already it just goes to show the premium materials that they use in this shoe isn't that gorgeous yeah fantastic shoe look at that bend see even when she bends the leather does crease a bit but it goes back to its original shape so over time this shoe is just going to look very good with wear and tear so yeah beautiful shoe two thumbs up that's all I have guys thanks for tuning in on Suka tiger in the white quick review overall very very nice quality shoe all right one more spin around please beautiful oh I love that logo ooh beautiful shoe that's all I have guys CIA look at that little dirt on the floor ciao,2025-06-23 14:44:47.074612 UTC

WbFSDghTMN0,on cloudmonster 2,what's up my friends welcome back to the channel and on today's video we're looking at a very popular shoe at least the last version was extremely popular so I'm expecting that this version is going to be right up there with popularity we're talking about the on cloud monster 2 but there's a couple things that you're going to need to know before you go and buy this shoe so stick around all right guys you know the drill let's get started off with those disclosures on was good enough to send me the cloud monster 2 for the purpose of review however they haven't told me what to say they don't have any editorial Privileges and all the thoughts and opinions are my own with that said you can pick up a pair of the oncloud monster 2 for $180 and of course I'll put links in the show notes just to make it that a little bit easier and just so you're aware those links are affiliate links using my links will never cost you anymore but they do help support the channel so let's get into it now I've put enough volume in the cloud monster 2 to form some opinions the good and the bad now don't get all worked up it is mostly good there's just a couple things that I think you need to know in fact the biggest thing you can probably avoid right off the bat and I think we'll talk about that right now and that is sizing now originally I was sent my usual size that I've worn in a lot of other on shoes and that's a usmen size 13 however when I put my foot into the size 13 Cloud monster 2 it was just way too big in fact I thought it was even too big for me to drop half a size so I dropped a full size down to a us- size 12 and you know what it fits me like a dream now me wearing a us- size 12 is not unheard of there are some Brands where I do wear a US size 12 what's funny is that all my other on shoes have been a size and they fit well so I want you to keep that in mind when you're picking up a pair for yourself I definitely recommend going down at least half a size maybe a full size in the cloud monster 2 now the oncloud monster 2 is a daily trainer right specifically it's a Max cushion daily trainer when I hold this up you can see we do have a big chunk of this midsole foam here making it Max cushion Cloud monster 2 has a 6 mm drop which I think is pretty ideal like it's right in the middle it's not too low it's not too high it's the Goldilocks of drops but because we do have this big stacke eye there is a lot of shoe here I mean the name gives it away right Cloud monster and on actually claims that a us men size 9 will tip the scale at 10.6 o or 300 G however in my size us men size 12 it tips a scale at 12 o or 339 G so yes it's a little on the heavy side but guys to be totally honest it's not that heavy not when we're comparing against other daily trainers it's always going to be heavy if we compare it against race day shoes but this is not that and when the cloud monster 2 is on my foot it actually carries its weight really well so that's going to be a product of all the components of the shoe working together with the geometry Oh and before we get started I want to tell you that the cloud monster 2 is using a total of 82% recycled materials in the entire shoe the upper alone is 100% recycled polyester so on really has brought their aame to the sustainability front as well as the looks Department I mean just like every other on shoe just look at that it does look pretty sharp doesn't it but I'm getting away from myself let's start at the top let's work our way down look at this heel collar just like a daily trainer lots of padding not too much it's actually it's actually a very comfortable amount of padding around the heel and there was a nice steping feel the heel counter is very rigid I didn't have any heel slip in the cloud monster 2 the upper is a very thin breathable mesh as far as overlays especially on the lateral side we have the logo this overlay with on running coming around the side and then following around the medial side there are some underlays coming around the toe box just to keep that upper off your foot and then we have the reinforcement along the eyelet chain so let's talk about the eyelet chain for a minute and I'm going to hold it up so you can see that I don't know if it's going to focus but I can overlay something to show you these laces are woven through almost like shock cords now they're not actually shock cords because they're not elastic but that's kind of what it looks like and because there is no grippiness to these shock cord Loops I found the laces were very easy to slide through them okay hold that thought also the upper on the cloud monster 2 is very roomy it's a high volume upper this is going to work fantastic if you have a little wider feet but not too wide to actually go to a wide shoe I think the cloud monster 2 is going to fit you like a dream I have fairly narrow feet so when I put my foot into a high volume Shoe like the cloud monster 2 I really have to cinch these laces together in order to get a good midfoot lock down so coming back to the lace loops and the laces it's very difficult to pull these laces and actually get them to stay in place of course I did it you just have to be a little more mindful when you're tying the laces so you don't let those laces inadvertently slip back through and loosen up but even when I did get the lock down where I thought it should be like the laces were tied enough across the top of my foot where I thought the shoe was going to stay in place overall the lockdown was not the most secure lockdown I've ever felt now don't get me wrong that almost sounds like I'm really bagging on it and it's not that bad I was able to put on the cloud monster 2 tie my laces and go out and I ran for hours and hours and hours with absolutely no issues I never had to retie the laces they didn't come undone but it's almost like that midfoot lockdown was not as secure enough as I might ideally like does that make sense I found there was a lot of room in the toe box but not too much it felt really good to be able to move my feet and overall I like what on has done here for me personally and look I know on can't make shoes just for me but because I have slightly narrow feet I would ideally like a slightly less volumous upper I think it would just make the shoe fit my foot a little better let's come down to the midsole now this year they're using a dual density midsole the helium super foam we have a compressed version here on top and we have the cloud Tech voids right here on the bottom and then sandwiched in between these two pieces of the helium super foam is a new reworked speedboard now on has reworked the material they've reworked the shape and they've done this so the speedboard works more efficiently with the midsole material and I got to say it works pretty well but before we talk about the ride let's just come down to the Alo I love this there's plenty of rubber up here on the foref foot there is more than enough here on the heel we've got some exposed hel on super foam in the middle but even on this exposed midsole foam I'm not seeing anywhere so I think this shoe is going to stand up to quite a lot now the shoe does have that speedboard inside so it's not going to be as flexible as a shoe without a speedboard or a plate but it's not super rigid and I'm still able to bend the shoe quite easily before we talk about ride let's talk about what this shoe compares to and for $180 the oncloud monster 2 is a a premium daily trainer and it's on the higher end of prices as far as premium daily trainers go and yes $180 is very expensive but I would say that you get a little more with a cloud monster 2 than you do from other premium daily trainers from some other brands now typically when we're talking about premium daily trainers we're talking about very plush shoes tons of padding all over they're definitely on the weighty side so as far as how this shoot feels on my foot and how it feels underfoot I think on has actually done something pretty good because the running feel how this shoe feels on my foot is slightly firmer than the competition and that's a good thing I don't want you to be scared Away by saying it's a firm ride it's a firm ride but it's not on the too firm end of that Spectrum it's a pleasant firmness now as soon as I got this shoe I opened it took it out of the box put it on my feet and I went out and I ran 20 mi and I think that was a pretty good test for this shoe because it performed like a champ as I already said I didn't have to retie the laces or anything I had no hotpots it was just comfortable and it felt good on my foot now towards the end of the run I was able to pick up the pace a little and the shoe performed well and really that's what I want in a daily trainer I don't always feel that way in some of those super plush daily trainers from some other brands so I think the the blend or the type of firmness that is in the cloud monster 2 combined with that speed board makes it a recipe for success and of course if you have already run in the original cloud monster I think you're going to be very pleased with a cloud monster too also if you don't like an incredibly plush ride you know that kind of plush that can feel sometimes like it's zapping your energy you certainly don't get that with the cloud monster 2 the firmness and that's speedboard translates to nice smooth Transitions and when it comes time to pick up the pace it lets you do that but let's be clear not pick up the pace like race Pace or interval Pace I'm talking about maybe strides at the end of an easy run or like I did picking up the pace at the end of a long run all in all I'd say the on the cloud monster 2 is best suited for easy runs although that speedboard does make picking up the pace feel a little better and here's what I found surprising in my testing is that when I took this shoe out when I wanted to go for a recovery effort the cloud monster 2 still felt pretty good I wasn't sure about it when I first put it on my foot I thought maybe it would be a little firm but as I already said it's a very pleasant firmness it's definitely cushioned enough and definitely protective enough to go out from recovery Paces up to easy Paces to definite long run Paces so guys I want to hear from you did you run in the original cloud monster are you thinking of picking up a pair of the cloud monster 2 if you haven't had either what is your current daily trainer or long run shoe of choice let me know in the comments but for now it's Matt B this has been my review of the oncloud monster 2 Be Kind be happy runwell I'll see you in a couple of days,2025-06-23 14:41:05.147260 UTC

N7MXNiiTf2k,Adidas Gazelle,what's up sneaker fans we outside today going to the Adidas brand Center to pick up these gazelle indoors so uh let's get it all right so we made it back and let me just start by saying I did not expect these to be as nice as they are um this is my first pair of gazelle indoors and I understand why people like these so much now seeing them in hand a little bit of quick history on these these were originally designed as an indoor soccer shoe we can see that from the modified traction pattern here but just like a lot of the other Adidas Originals releases that we get like the samba the Superstar and of course the gazelle they've transcended their original usage whether it's basketball or tennis or soccer and and they have become a lifestyle staple for a lot of people not only are they a comfortable shoe but they just look really really nice and these are no different I really like this particular colorway because of that translucent rubber there but enough said let's take a closer look at these starting from the upper all right so before we get into the upper details let's take a quick look at the packaging here so these come in your standard Adidas original box and they're blue nothing really too special about this but taking a look at the label here official name of these gazelle indoor W for woman so this is technically a woman's release and that's what the sizing chart is based out of so my regular size in Adidas um is a size eight the conversion in Adidas is one full size up so I got a size N9 and these fit perfectly so one full size up from your regular Adidas size and you should be good to go now let's take a closer look at these starting from the upper and the majority of your upper is in this smooth white leather far as the quality of the leather goes it is very nice for the $120 retail what I really like about these is the is how dark the color Choice was for these three stripes we have this green black and green and I think those colors are really complimented by this semi-translucent gum msol so really cool that because it's such a dark color for these three stripes you can really see them peeking through the midsole here I think that's a really cool look and you get that on both sides of the shoe so no change here in the variation of colors your middle stripe is black and you have your two green there taking a look at the toe box here it does look pretty narrow right but actually on feet these fit pretty medium I didn't feel like my foot was being squeezed or anything there was plenty of space for me and uh these were actually surprisingly comfortable very form fitting I will say the worst thing that you can have in a shoe is your foot sliding around in it that's how you get blisters so you want your foot to be right and um these get it little gazelle detail there on the tongue it is perforated you have this design on it as well as our Adidas trold badge here these come stock with flat white laces no extra set of laces with these the inner lining is also a white leather material so these will last most likely this is a synthetic leather and we get that same sort of look and feel for our sock liner as well the underside of this looks to be ortholite but it has the little Speckles which means it is some recycled materials in there you get a little extra little piece of padding here for the arch of your foot Adidas branding there little bit of glue moving on now to the mitso and out soole we do get our gazelle indoor mitle outsole so these were designed as an indoor soccer shoe so they get a redesigned rubber cup sole in this department aside from the color this is also a really interesting addition this was my first pair of gazelle indoors and this little like Outrigger piece here that goes all around the midsole actually adds a substantial amount of stability or at least the feeling of stability under your feet I was surprised by how comfortable the gazelle indoor is and I think this uh redesigned cupsole has a large part to do with it as far as traction goes indoors or outdoors I think you're going to be covered a really sticky rubber um material here on this but also because of the way that the pattern is designed really flexible this are these are pretty much huge Flex Groves for the whole entire outsole of your shoe um with the added benefit of just looking really cool all those little Tri logos in there a really cool detail um but also very grippy if you know what I mean and there you have it that is my review of these right here the gazelle indoors again I really love the modified design on these from the midsole here and this outre that goes around the whole entire shoe honestly it's probably just a couple millimet if that but it adds a lot of stability under under feet or at least the feeling of stability under feet the colorway I think is also super nice with those two contrast colors on the three stripes here one of the better gazelle indoor colorways that have released but if for whatever reason this translucent look on the midsole is not your Vibe we actually today February 9th got another release of the gazelle indoors from kith that colorway is also uh mostly white upper with some green accents on it but instead of this translucent type rubber for our mental outsole you get a solid there and I checked the price these were $10 for that kith collaboration you're only paying an extra $10 which you know is not as bad as I expected them to be so I'll leave a link in the description for this colorway as well as that kith colorway and um yeah that's about it so thanks for watching if you haven't already please like the video if you found it helpful subscribe for more sneaker content if you have any questions

1IULrEQhshg,PUMA Suede,whats good everyone youtube it's me again back with another video and today we're gonna be reviewing a shoe that I think they haven't reviewed this brand before on my channel we're actually going to be reviewing a pretty shoe and for this particular release this came out back in 2018 and it was to mark the 50-year anniversary of the premise suede I was kind of surprising how all the shoe is but it's still worn to this day and for this particular release they decided to commemorate um the b-boy scene because if you guys don't know the Pumas story it's actually kind of like a weapon of choice for a lot of b-boys and fun facts if you haven't noticed already when I first started dancing a few years ago I actually wanted to be a b-boy I think it's like every every boy's dream at some point to try become a break oh but that gotta went to the side and during that period of time which is around 2018 you know this sort of shoe came out along with the full track suit which I haven't worn outside before this is the first time I'm wearing it you know quarantine times so I thought you know this is the only time ever gonna break it out as I may as I'll do it for the review and it was all on sale so you know that's why I ended up picking up a whole set but geez but enough about my aspirations of trying to be a b-boy um we're here to talk about the shoes so today we're talking about the Puma suede classic b-boy fabulous in the red color way if you haven't already noticed so yeah um with the intro all the way let's get into the box so I've never bought a premise way before in like the normal color ways so I'm not exactly sure if the box is that different but on the top we've got this white stripe with the 50 anniversary mark I guess and the persuade and then there's a little thing of the bottom saying you know the premise way to Street legend established in 1968 jeez and reimagined in 2018 so pretty old if you ask me and then I'm pretty sure that is German on the side I don't read German or French or whatever it is I'm not gonna try and guess what it is and it's a lid style box and then on the inside we've got this first layer of like plastic and this plastic has a pretty interesting texture on it or at least pattern on it and this is actually supposed to represent the outsole pattern that's found on the penis Wade's itself they've got a standard layer of paper as well and then stopped in just like the toe of the shoe we had like a small bit of paper and then we've got these two plastic bags and inside each plastic bag in this one we've got thin red laces they've got a lace Debray that says suede on it and on this bag in this bag we brought some thick white fat laces that we've got another lace Dubray that says that 1968 so if you haven't figured it out already I've actually put one on each side so it says suede 1968 I thought that'd be interesting and if we move to the label it reads suede classic bboy fabulous so the retail price on these I'm pretty sure the retail on these was a bit more expensive probably like 150 or so however I didn't pick these up at retail they'll actually add that outlets for about 90 bucks and actually with the full track suit put together as well the track suit was about 90 bucks as well so for a full 180 you can get a full red outfit but I mean who actually wears this but I'll put the conversion here for the shoes and for 90 bucks I'm pretty sure persuades usually retail at 90 bucks anyway so it's just like a standard price so the fact you get extra laces and like a nice little lace Dubreuil is kinda nice so yeah with the box alloy let's get into the shoes and here we are the Puma suede jeez the Puma suede classic bboy fabulous in the red color way so if you guys have seen Pumas weight before it's very much unchanged in terms of like this overall construction you still have the very signature profile the sort of like swoosh kind of shape that's signature to Puma and the same outsole and stuff so I'll just talk about some of the key differences that are on this shoe and the first thing is that we've got this slightly upgraded material on the logo part itself it's supposed to be like this sort of imprinted it looks like almost like crocodile skin it probably isn't actually a crocodile skin but it makes the shoe look pretty snappy and then on the back we've also got that same sort of like crocodile skin leather so the gold Puma logo are pressed into it and as you can see on my left shoe I've decided to put fat laces with the 1968 but then on my right show decided to use the red laces so then when you read the two together it says suede 1968 and also just you know playing around with like two different lace options on the shoe but yeah aside from that as the name implies Prima suede we've got a suede upper it's done in this nice red color but it tends to bleed quite badly because it's already believe it's already bled on the laces itself on this white lace and then moving down to the midsole the midsole is just this like sort of cops'll with this heavy texture on the side as well as a different texture on the toe and then if we move to the outside we've just got this signature sort of like almost like squared square cross pattern and this is pretty typical for most persuades so honestly that covers that pretty much the main features of this entire shoe there really isn't much to it now in terms of sizing I will say that I find the Pima Swedes seem to fit like the tiniest bit long however I will say they're also quite a narrow shoe so I would say for the average person if you have normal to wide feet stick true to size in this shoe but if you happen to have super narrow feet you may possibly be able to get away with the half-size down in the shoe but for general sakes I would say go true to size in this shirt so I'm typically a us 9 1/2 and most of my sneakers I bought these in the US are nine and a half and they fit me great now in terms of comfort despite the fact this is also quite old you know yes it's very uncomfortable and compared to other shoes today but I don't know if it's the compound they use but this compound that they use on the outsole is actually pretty flexible and like it's kind of soft I would say it's a I'd actually say it's a little more comfortable than say like old converse like all stars chuck seventies are really good but more stars up Oh yikes but this is actually not too bad and then the upper itself it's just mostly suede and it's fairly flexible actually because it's a pretty thin cover suede but it's not exactly that breathable so overall I would just say for a shoe that's 50 years old the comfort is honestly to be expected now I get into the part of the video where I talk about my opinions on this shoe and honestly I'll just say it right now I shouldn't have bought these shoes I have like this weird like sense of like kneading sets and collections so whenever I see like track suits and oh that is unprofessional whenever I see like track suits and like matching shoes I always find myself more inclined to buy it and when I was at the outlets and I sold that like yeah the full track suit top and bottom as well as the shoe itself well under like 200 bucks they ended up pulling the trigger thinking I'd be like some mad bee boy in the future now that I do popping I'm not sure if this is an alpha that really suits but that's an overall package if I was a b-boy and I really liked being flashy I'd probably enjoy something like I mean even on the zipper we've got suede written here which is like the same as the waist degree on the other side so if you've got like a swag doubt b-boy I'm sure this would be something that you'd be more inclined to go with and if I would still be boring I probably already be wearing this a lot but as it stands right now this is sort of like a shoe I keep around mostly as a memory of like where my dance used to be you know maybe one day I will use these for popping anyway but I probably have to remove any of like the be worried references well actually there are no b-boy references it's just a celebration of the suede but overall I'd say it's still a pretty like nice profile the suede is actually quite a inoffensive and like going to shoe in this red color it definitely pops so there was a black colorway which I think was much easier to get and didn't actually end up at the outlets but overall I just say I probably should have bought this but I still keep her around nonetheless and yeah with that we've come to the end of another video so I'd love to hear your opinions on this Pumas white classic b-boy fabulous in this red hallway and I guess out of the two colorways which one would you lean more towards I know like right now it's with the whole quarantine I'm having to dig through shoes that I've had for ages that probably aren't relevant these days but you know I always try to put out a content that will be somewhat interesting but yeah I'd love to hear what you guys think so like comment subscribe leave a comment in the comment section down below and if you're into more videos

W-em7C8Ckjc,Nike Cortez,"when I had to go you know I win and so you just run yeah welcome back everyone to another episode of Shay TV my name is Marissa Hill and today we're going to be taking a look at a very iconic silhouette these are the Nike Cortez ogs and their coined the forest gumps let's take a quick sneak peek welcome back everyone to another unboxing and review if you're joining us for the first time welcome in be sure to hit that subscribe down below if you're not already subscribed to the channel give this video a thumbs up if you enjoy these unboxing and styling segments today we're going to be talking about a very classic silhouette as you can probably already tell these definitely are signified from the film Forest Gump which is why they coined that and they did actually sell out quite quickly on The Seekers app for the initial launch of these recently so we'll go through the overview of these jump into size and fit followed by how I styled this classy looking color scheme then we'll conclude with how much these went for on the retail market so let's jump right into it for those of you who are fans of the film Forest Gump which Forest Gump of course was played by the iconic Tom Hanks it's crazy to think that this I guess is unofficially celebrating the fact that Forest Gump is going and heading back into theaters after 30 years so it will be its 30th anniversary and this is pretty much I feel like one of the simple movies that really exploded the Nike Cortez sneaker itself I definitely owned a couple pairs of these while I was in high school uh and I definitely feel like right now as far as competition goes with Adidas and their iconic Samba and gazelle Silhouettes this is kind of Nike going back into the archives and bringing more of a Slender cut sneaker into the mix to really push back with a great lifestyle sneaker so as far as the film goes if you remember for Forest ran over 15,000 miles he definitely decided to really go the distance literally started with I just wanted to run to the end of the block to the end of town to I'm just going to keep running to the fact that he started running for so long he grew out this massive beard and it was so iconic just seeing how destroyed those cz's War because he really burned out the mileage in these bad boys uh so as far as the initial release these uh released the specific Cortez silhouette back in 1972 uh this actual color combination didn't actually officially release until 2018 uh and then in 2019 we actually saw more of a basic Forest Gump that was released and the most recent I guess or couple most recent color combinations that kind of relate to this color blocking would be the clock which was kind of a sneaker within a sneaker but it was still the Cortez and I brought out my Skai variation just because I feel like this is kind of similar as well but there's definitely some subtle changes with the types of blue they used on the Cortez versus this uh but definitely if you are somebody who is really about collecting sneakers that have something to do with a bit of history and they're iconic for those types of reasons this is maybe something you want to look into cuz as far as the quality goes I feel like they really did nail this as you can see on the upper here we've got just really high quality white smooth leather and then we've got this nice just embellished detail here with the Nike for the lace toggle on both of the laces and it's in that silver plated texture and then we've got white laces a nice just simple white mesh tongue and then some nice accents of red on the embroidered Nike and swish Mark so let's look at those details then we'll move along to the side handling all right so wrapping around the side panels more smooth white tumbled leather there and then some smooth red leather on the swish marks making its way to the back and then we've got some overlays of white for the Nike and swo as we work our way to lateral side same exact color combination and then the interior is actually let me fill this texture we have a leather insole in red and white so we are getting an actually upgraded texture for the insole on these making a more luxurious sneaker the sneaker is completed with a white and light blue on the midsole and then we've got that same white finish for the out soole as far as a couple few variations in changes in the silhouette a lot of people have actually complained about the Cortez warping over time so they actually added some stronger firmer side paneling on here to prevent that warping from happening and as far as the toe box goes you can see that this is a very narrow silhouette they actually widen that toe box a bit to give you some rumor roomier space for this narrow silhouette all right so let's take a look at all those details then jump into size and fit so as far as size and fit goes I actually went true to size in these ones and I definitely would recommend going up half a size I do feel like these especially for people with wider feet will find these to run a bit more on The Snug end of things and I do have neuro feet and I still feel like I need a bit of extra space in the toebox region so sizing half uh up is definitely what I would recommend all right so as far as styling goes again super iconic color scheme wanted to keep it pretty simple though so for the first look I decided to wear just a nice monochromatic look with a navy uh Romper do think Navy tones will definitely go well with this and I feel like this is also going to be a great Fourth of July shoe check your eyes we're getting better every time like silent shadows in the night go and stay in the doorway let me know when the coast is clear for the second look I wore a simple just red tank and some nice denim pants and show them how to live and Fe here we go again they got more than we can take and they cheat US every day so I'm telling you stop treating me like I'm a criminal never once I'm cheating you you're the king I withraw when you g it never KN I know that criminal now it's time to turn the page and your Manion is the stage they just throw it in our face is what I got and for the last and final look I wore a light denim mini dress TI of waiting on your tables got of shining up your shoes I'm feeling helpless for so long I think it's time that you felt that talking Stacks a cash so high you have to double check your eyes we're getting better every time like silent shadows in the night go on and stay in the doorway and let me know when in somebody's car I hope it's yours driving me crazy loving me baby that's the only way I want to fall aart if I'm going to end up hurt and somebody's arms I hope it's yours driving me crazy Ling me baby that's the only way I want to break my heart so I wear my best dress for an earthquake grab a drink and hope I don't sink through the floor while I'm asking you for more I'm going to regret it in the morning when my bedroom is on fire but if I said that it was in exciting baby I would be a liar oh if I'm going to crash and fun in somebody's car I hope it's yours driving me crazy loving me baby that's the only all right so as far as retail goes these retailed for $110 and I do think that the Cortez has always really just been a very popular silhouette just because of that price point I feel like the retail value on these is a lot more accessible and more affordable and especially if you're looking for a great just nice lifestyle looking sneaker this is definitely something I feel like I am drawn to when matching my looks from day to day all right everyone that is it for this unboxing and review if you joined us for the first time thank you so much be sure to hit that join on your way out if you're not already uh subscribed to the channel and give this video a thumbs up this is Shay TV my name is Marissa Hill we'll catch you all next up episode baby that's thing",2025-06-23

nlG4_ZHKnvg,Nike Air Max 90,when I was a kid I was really into the Air Max 90 infrared colorway I can't remember why but I do remember someone telling me that if you're short getting the Air Max 90 is a huge height booster and even though I'm not insecure about my height nowadays for some reason those words stuck out to me all these years whenever I wanted a pair it was never in stock so it was definitely a popular colorway but this time around randomly browsing the Nike catalog I found these Air Max 90 infrared with gortex sitting online and so I bought a pair because who doesn't want to keep their prize sneakers clean with minimal effort straight to the facts this Air Max 90 fits true to size in my Nei sizing and they retail at $160 USD or $210 Canadian there are very little differences between the OG infrared versus the cortex other than the leather being smooth and grainy as opposed to Suede and the Air Max logo is no longer on the lateral side of the shoe but instead it's in the gortex logo in Black now this is my first pair of Air max90s so I really didn't know what to expect in terms of comfort but I do know that they implement the air bubble in the heel as well as having Eva cushion in the rest of the shoe the shoe itself feels like you're being hugged by a lot of padding however it also feels very narrow and have pretty wide feet it's strange that it's like this because it has a pretty round toe box on the outside and it looks like has a lot of room however due to all that padding it really just suffocates your feet I would be very curious to see how well these perform in the summer heat they aren't chunky in terms of width but they do look chunky vertically and I also found that the iconic shark fin color blocking very breking and classic in terms of styling for the shoe the shoe is also quite heavy and not very flexible so I feel like it's not the best in terms of mobility and it's kind of typical of Nike shoes to be more comfortable after you break them in that said I'm not a huge believer or fan in that because I just don't have the patience to give a sneaker a try if had to break them in in order to feel good it almost feels like a marketing trick because it just seems like they're trying to get the consumer to keep the shoes longer term before they actually find out that they actually don't like the shoe either way in conclusion I hate falling into this category but the reason why I'm buying this shoe is definitely because of the looks over the practicality and I'm not proud of saying that either way I'm glad that gortex at least will save me in terms of keeping these Infrareds clean anyways let me know in the comments down below if you've ever owned a pair of Air max90s and I'll definitely be doing a 500 Miles test with this sneaker eventually this has been Billy visuals y'all just got visualized and I'll see you in the next video peace,2025-06-23 11:26:29.213178 UTC
C0TJAx2RL70,Adidas Gazelle,when it comes to comfort I can honestly say it is not there this is a old school classic shoe so the insoles are very very thin and it's nothing special to it but what I'm going to do personally is put a pair of insoles in here so my shoes are comfortable whenever I have to put them on I highly recommend putting an inso in the shoe because this shoe is flat and trust me long wears in a flat bottom shoe will hurt your feet Comfort may not be the primary factor when purchasing these sneakers as they offer a typical flat bottom design similar to Vans or up tailor,2025-06-23 14:38:59.807025 UTC
9sWrbBacAjY,Nike Cortez,when it comes to fit and comfort the Cortez is pretty solid It does run half a size smaller so make sure you guys go half a size up when purchasing It's great for regular to narrow feet thanks to its snug fit So if,2025-06-23 11:22:08.432206 UTC
VkFuaDbJTwI,PUMA Suede,when it comes to sizing I think it's safe to say that you can go a full size up and the pleasures pum a sued XL normally I'm a size 12 but I got this sneaker in a size 13 and it fits perfectly meaning that this shoe runs a full size small so if you're getting this shoe be sure to go a full size up and you'll have no problem,2025-06-23 14:42:14.960274 UTC
RyN3ceEM79o,Nike Dunk Panda,when we started talking about doing a video on the nike dunks i could not wrap my head around why these are so popular because they just they look cheap they look like jordan ones they're really not interesting in any way and then they told me that they sell out instantly anytime there's a drop and then they resell for three to four times the price so we're going to cut them apart and try to answer three questions how much of the shoe is leather and the quality thereof what's on the inside of this shoe and are these shoes worth the money so let's start dissecting the shoe by cutting a few of these panels off or apart to see if this is leather if it's not because sometimes it's really hard to tell with nike's really cheap leather so i'm gonna pop this swoosh first and as you can see it is real leather so let's do this back heel panel here that's leather as well then to this lace panel that is leather too and then to the toe both of these panels are leather as well so surprisingly this whole shoe the whole upper is made of leather and it's about one millimeter thick but it is so cheap and so fake filling it might as well not even be real leather because the way they make this leather is they take all the really low quality hides that have all the flaws all the imperfections they trim off the very top layer to give it a nice even texture on top then they lay down a fat layer of polyurethane or plastic on top then they emboss a fake leather print on the top so they end up looking cheap they look fake they crease literally the first time you bend this leather it creases because of the plastic on top and most importantly with this much synthetic material on top of real leather it slowly separates and slowly fakes and that those creases slowly become a separation and a little bit of a bubble you can already see it we i literally we've worn these for the b-roll you can see there's a bubble right there because that polyurethane separates from the leather so easily it's just a really sneaky way to hide a really terrible leather while still being able to call it leather and having people associate the higher quality benefits of leather to the shoe but in all reality almost all the benefits that you get from leather are gone when you use this cheap of a leather it's like mcdonald's chicken nuggets if you ask mcdonald's are the chicken nuggets chicken like yeah technically it's chicken but is it chicken like well technically there's chicken in it but is it chicken well by name it's chicken because if you actually call it what it actually is which is just mostly bread with some ground of mystery meat and a lot of filler that doesn't retain any of the nutritional value of real chicken nugget nuggets nobody would buy them and that's how i view this leather and to show you how cheap and how not leathery this leather is if we put a flame to it you can see how fast that polyurethane or that plastic on top starts curling up starts smoking starts melting and that's not what leather does and it's the top layer so it's all it's all about the image of leather so to me this this leather is the chicken nuggets of the leather world but as for the rest of this shoe i actually really do like this cup sole because it is fully stitched all the way around it's not a fake stitch and that stitch goes all the way through the upper into the interior of the shoe and i highly doubt that anyone's ever had any issues with this separating because it's glued as well and so it is a very solid construction style with the cup sole but what about the midsole and to me that's kind of the crux of this shoe is how is it built on the inside what are the materials and that's to me either the make or break aspect of this shoe whether it's worth it or not and so let's cut this thing in half okay i got it chopped in half and it would be one thing if i if we cut this in half at the the retail price but we bought these at the retail price and when they're so terrible or at least the leather's so terrible it's extra painful to cut apart a shoe when you paid three times the retail price but let's see what's inside so the midsole is just a big chunk of foam and i actually like this a lot better than some of the other shoes we've cut apart in this price range by some of these big brands like the stan smiths that have that lattice structure and the columns on the inside because i like this foam more because it doesn't give you those high pressure points where that lattice structure intersects it molds your foot a little bit better it's more comfortable underfoot and it doesn't collapse as much if you're a bigger guy so really this is basically just the air jordan without the air unit so the final question are they worth it for a hundred bucks i get it they're a vintage style sneaker they're full leather even almost garbage leather they're a decent construction with the stitching and everything and i think that it's on par with other nikes and it's it's actually cheaper than what i expected it to be for such a popular sneaker but for anything more than a hundred dollars for the resale prices dunks are dumb i do not waste your money on dunks they they're just a very basic shoe and most videos i start off with the planning phase and the the idea phase not really liking the shoes or being impartial to them but by the end of the video i kind of get where they're coming from the materials have won me over and the unique designs and all these aspects i get to the point where i understand why people are willing to pay that resale price to get a more rare shoe kind of like the yeezys where there's a limited quantity and they're really unique and they're just kind of a wild shoe but with these they're so basic and so cheap and they drop them so often that i feel like i'm taking crazy pills when i see people freaking out about these shoes i feel like i'm taking crazy pills and how much hype's around them and when people are paying three or 400 bucks for them like our graphic designer sam said it just feels like it's a template to do collaborations off of them change the colors slightly the materials slightly just to make a crazy amount of money kind of at least to me they're kind of a bland sneaker with the bland construction that are forced to be substantially more money for literally no other reason than people buying them up on every single drop putting them on these resale sites and jacking the price up just to make more money and maybe i'm being a little harsh on them because i care a lot more about the materials and the tech and the science behind everything and but i'm open to having my mind change so if you're a dunks die hard and you think i'm missing something here i am really curious but i feel like i feel like i'm missing something and i just don't get these so to me dunks are dumb and i would never pay anything i wouldn't pay a dollar more than the retail price for these so let me know what you guys think and thank you so much for everything you guys do we passed we just passed half a million subscribers we have some cool videos planned here's a little preview some of the boots and shoes we have coming up to celebrate the half a million subscriber mark and thank you guys so much for your support i never thought we'd get to half a

vfXeRoUcDqo,Converse Chuck Taylor All Star,yeah no it's crazy they're all crazy they're out here watching reviews of shoes they already bought serial killers if you ask me oh not you I mean the other people watching the video you know not you though not you you're you're not crazy at all hey what's going on y'all know I'm just kiding around here my name is Chris and on this channel I like to make content around men's shoes clothes and groomy products as a whole so if that's something you're interested in go ahead and hit that subscribe button and without further Ado let's get to the mean potatoes man this getting aggressive every time I say that right to start off with I think everyone should know that these shoes do not fit true to size now I normally wear a size n in almost everything and occasionally I go up to a 9 and a half and well very rare I go up to the 10 right now they were actually out of nines but he told me that if you wear nine in Vans which I had on at that time then you probably wear a eight and duck Taylor and I was like there's no way so don't bring me a 10 and the eight just to see cuz I was like yeah an eight I haven't worn an eight since like Middle School right but sure enough soon as he brought them out tried on the 10 and they were way too big in the eights they fit now if you have a flat or wide foot then maybe you might want to go a half size down but definitely sizing up ain't the way to go on these now outside of the sizing the toe box is a little narrow but it's not much of a nuisance like you won't really notice that it kind of Narrows in at the top like most shoes do the tongue is really narrow canvas so it doesn't squeeze on your foot that much and it kind of weirds me out that there's no branding like on the tongue itself cuz that's that's where branding always is right or is that just me and again I just want to say one more time that if you have a bigger foot or just a wider foot than most people you might want to only go a half size down rather than a full size down just give you that extra room up at the front the first day I got these I wore these for 6 hours straight 6 hours and I can tell you for a fact that these are more comfortable than Nike blazers I I'm sorry I hate to tell you but they are the insole of this shoe is actually surprisingly thick and it makes a big difference it's about half an inch thick to be more precise at the heel as I said before I wore these for 6 hours straight and by the end like the pad part of my foot did start to hurt but you talking about 6 hours I mean I was up walking around sitting down moving around a lot so I put them to the test pretty fast just to see now you'll also see people lifting in these a lot just like you see people lifting weights in the Blazers and it's pretty much for the same reason that they're flat at the hill they're they're pretty base and they wrap around your foot really nicely I know I said that the toe box kind of Curves in but sizing down to an eight for what it is it's a decent amount of space in the toe box even with the toe being this Rubber and having this extra rubber wrapping around it it's still a good amount of space in the shoe itself I really don't think it should be too hard to wear these for hours on in no matter what kind of foot you have I don't know you know what I mean though it's really shouldn't be these aren't like straight up walking shoes but you should be okay to go out and about and have a full day with these the hill of the shoe does have that cardboard insert or whatever material they use which I learned is actually called the stiffener and it does help keep the shape of the shoe and it makes it a little bit easier to put the shoe on in general cuz as we know high tops are not the easiest to put on especially leather and and canvas so overall the comfort is a lot better than I remember it when I had a pair back in like middle school or whatever and while we're here really quick let's just go ahead and touch on the price convers are actually really affordable they're $60 everywhere I mean online on their website they retail for $60 I got mine at Journeys and guess what they were $60 in almost every colorway I don't know if the Chuck 7s are but the original Allstars are 60 bucks and that means that you don't really have to shop around the colorways are almost always readily available wherever you go especially in summer cuz people just like to wear these in the summer they really are a summer shoe let's go talk about the materials over there on the table because you might be surprised before we get into the materials is it just me or did the patch used to be on the outside of the shoe not the inside you're like Chris what what do we really even need to talk about the materials for because there's not much to it it's canvas and rubber right and yeah you're kind of right about that most of the shoe is canvas including the tongue the upper and uh yeah that's that's that's it but canvas isn't a very breathable material so wearing these on the hot summer day your feet might get a little bit sweaty which brings me to my next point about the two little eyelets down here at the bottom now from what I could tell and to me I think that they're to help with air flow and a lot of other people on the Internet seem to agree that they're for airflow and that's because these were originally basketball shoes so the thought was these will help whenever you lift your foot up there would be more air coming through and it back down you know air push out and I've seen on some other places on the internet like Reddit and whatever else that some people are saying that you're supposed to put your laces through those eyelids and it's supposed to help with foot support so you can plant your foot more which I don't know about all that through here and back through here you want to lace it through this hole I'm going to go with the part about it being for air flow because that just makes sense but if you know different or if you've heard different let me know in the comments below and since we're on the topic of interesting things about the material there's actually a patent on these shoes and I know that because right here on the insole itself there's a patent number and I thought the patent was originally for the hill and the insole itself cuz that makes sense right no it's for the bottom out soole of the shoes it's actually a patent for and I got to read this really quick for a shoe with slip resistant shape retaining Fabric outsole and as you can see the outsoles actually have a cloth material on them and that's what the patent is for this cloth material on the outside of a shoe which is to help with slipping now you're like how you know it's for slipping because it says it right there on the Pat but this also kind of explains the multiple patterns on the bottom of the shoes as you can see there's like one two three about three or four different patterns going on on the outs of the shoe the Chun tayls are a great casual shoe anybody can wear them and I mean you could almost wear them with anything not a suit but some people might everyone's had a pair in their time at some point or another and it's just another classic that I don't think is going anywhere anytime soon so if you've been on the fence about getting them hopefully this video helps you out and helps you decide if you actually do want to go ahead and grab a wear these and you already know I'm going to do the styling video and everything I know I know yeah as for the black ones but it's summertime so I'll grab the white ones I know I know my bad my bad so that's going to be it for this one as always I'll see you in the next one now you know probably way more about Converse than you ever wanted to but there you go,2025-06-23 11:21:40.299587 UTC
4-Ciwfb2vy8,Nike Air Max 90,yeah so i feel like i'm due for an upgrade what's up everybody i'm seth fowler and today i'm reviewing the 2020 retro of the nike air max 90 infrared also known as the air max 3 radiant red thanks so much for tuning in today make sure to hit that subscribe button down below if you haven't yet and you want to see more content just like this and also make sure to give me a follow on instagram and on twitter at real seth fowler but getting into the video this release for me has been a long time coming this has been a shoe that i've been looking forward to since pretty much 2015 when the last retro released the air max 90 has always been one of my favorite air max silhouettes and i always love the og colorway and so every time that this shoe re-releases i've got to grab a pair and as you can tell my last pair from 2015 has been heavy in rotation for the last five years and it's one of the only shoes that i've worn almost every day of the week that uh i haven't gotten rid of so obviously today was kind of a special day for me because i finally have that replacement in fact i went to the mall this morning and picked it up so the air max 90 infrared originally released back in 1990 which is two years before i was born and when this shoe first released it was actually dubbed the air max 3. the reason for that was obviously that it was the third air max silhouette but over the years the shoe became known as the air max 90 which was also the year that it released and the reason this shoe is retroing now is because 2020 is the 30th anniversary of the air max 3 or air max 90. the 2020 infrared air max 90s released today on november 9th for a retail price of 140 bucks and not only that but they also released in their original packaging as well speaking of their packaging before we actually get into the shoe itself let's take a quick look at the box this shoe comes in a relatively narrow gray and red box with the top of the box being bright red with the nike air branding in the top right hand corner along the sides of the box we've got alternating gray stripes that can be found on a lot of different air max boxes and then on the front of the box you've got the size tag which obviously names this shoe the air max 3 instead of the air max 90. but jumping into the shoe itself on the toe you get to your familiar light gray felt feeling synthetic suede which we've all come to know and love on the air max 90s it's not a premium feeling material but at the end of the day this is a running shoe or at least it used to be a running shoe and because of that it's definitely not a bad touch i know for me it brings back memories of getting stains on that material and not being able to get them out because that material is so absorbent just above that you've got your bright white nylon mesh which is really soft and also pretty nicely padded moving up farther on the shoe you get more of that gray suede as well as these flat white laces of course these laces weave through the iconic infrared tpu eyelet panel at the bottom of the tongue and then through this black tpu panel at the top of the tongue underneath the laces you've got a very nicely padded white tongue with a nike air max patch at the top i'm sure you're catching on by this point but this shoe remains relatively unchanged construction wise from the previous retro and for me that's a good thing the shape of the panels themselves are slightly more narrow and slightly truer to the og but the overall cut of the shoe is relatively the same moving inside the sneaker you've got an infrared colored sock liner on the back of the tongue and a gray sock liner everywhere else and the insole of the shoe comes in bright infrared with the nike air branding printed on the heel in white one of the things i really love about air max 90 insoles is that if you look at the bottom of them you'll notice that the traction pattern of the shoe is actually pressed into the bottom of the insole which i think is such a cool detail as for sizing and fit the air max 90 infrared or i guess the air max 3 radiant red fits true to size and just like every other pair of recent air max 90s from my experience nike's air max models usually seem to fit true to size they do a really great job with sizing but as i always suggest because everyone's feet are different i would definitely suggest trying on a pair of these first before you buy them just to make sure you're grabbing the right size for you continuing back in the shoe on the bottom half of the upper you've got this black synthetic leather just above that you've got more of that felt feeling light gray suede as well as a nike swoosh in a slightly darker shade of gray but in the same material a detail that i really love on this 20 20 retro is that nike actually added an original looking nike air hang tag on the right shoe towards the ankle of the shoe you've got a nice little hit of infrared with the air max logo right there in the center of the black leather and then moving around to the heel of the shoe you've got this nice infrared heel tab with the nike air logo in the middle in black moving down on the shoe you get to your iconic air max 90 or air max 3 midsole that comes primarily in white with your infrared hit around the air unit then finally moving to the bottom of the shoe you've got this black rubber outsole with infrared hits around the mid foot and on the toe the 20 20 nike air max 3 radiant red or air max 90 infrared is one of my favorite retros of the year now to be honest with you guys it's not really a big change at all it's just a retro of the original shoe they haven't made too many changes other than the packaging the hang tag and some very minor differences around the upper but this is one of those timeless sneakers that no matter what decade this shoe releases in it always looks modern and current the nike air max 90 and in particular the nike air max 90 in the infrared colorway is one of the most iconic shoes of all time and as a sneaker head this is a sneaker that i really feel like you should have in your collection but with that we pretty much wrap up the video for today now i would love to know your thoughts on this sneaker and whether you grabbed one for yourself when they released this morning or whether you let this pair go so make sure to let me know in the comment section down below but as always thank you so much for watching make sure to subscribe if you haven't yet and i'll see you all in the next one you,2025-06-23 11:26:30.442745

9_Hb6Pgf6KA,Yeezy 350 v2,yes i did put on this easy gap hoodie specifically for this video and no i haven't worn it any other time so after years of releasing the same exact sneaker in different color ways the yeezy boost 350 v2 it seems like kanye west and adidas have decided to change things up pretty dramatically over the last year we've had the mono version of the 350s we're getting the compact version of the 350s later this year and now we have the mx versions of the 350s and while no the mx version of the 350s are not as different as something like the monos or the compacts it's still a new take on the 350s and in my opinion it's one of my favorite 350s to date what's up everybody i'm seth fowler and today i'm reviewing the upcoming adidas yeezy boost 350 v2 mx oat not only that i'm also giving a pair away thanks so much for tuning in today if you want to find out more information on how you can win this pair for yourself make sure to stay tuned until later on in the video and i'll give you all the details but before we dive into the in-depth review let me tell you guys a little bit of information on the release of this shoe so the easy boost 350 v2 mx oat releases this weekend on october 23rd 2021 for a retail price of 220 bucks and while we're on release information let me show you guys how these shoes will be packaged so as you probably could have guessed these 350s come in the standard drawer box you find a lot of different yeezy sneakers coming in it comes in the natural cardboard finish with 350 and boost printed on the sides it doesn't look like these shoes come with a separate set of laces which i guess makes sense because they don't have infinity laces and have standard laces and you usually don't get two sets of laces with yeezys unless you've got the infinity lacing system or they come with like a crazy colored set of laces and then rounding off the box you've got the size tag on the back which as you guys can see i got my pair from goat and that's why there's this giant goat sticker on the side also if you guys want to grab a pair for yourself from goat maybe an early pair or check the resale prices i've left an affiliate link to goat in the description below as you can see i went for a size nine and a half for my pair and then also the official colorway of this shoe is mx0 mx0 mx-0 they don't really list out colors on yeezy sneaker tags anymore they just kind of repeat the name of the sneaker which is weird but whatever but getting back to the sneaker itself here it is the easy boost 350 v2 mx 0. so as you probably know this is the first pair of yeezy boost 350 v2s to feature this brand new mx primeknit pattern now from what i've heard mx stands for mixed which makes a lot of sense because the upper of the shoe looks like it's been marbled it looks like something you do in like grade school art class where you get like a bin of water and then you put paint in the top and then kind of dip something into it or like i don't know get a comb and you know mix it up you guys know what i'm talking about and actually you know what i was always really a fan of that look maybe it's because i was nostalgic for those hard classes or something like that but i've always dug that marbled aesthetic now like i said this is the very first 350 mx to release but this is not the first yeezy mx to release so far we've actually had two mx easies drop and they were both foam runners the first pair was the grey and tan color and the second pair was the tan and brown color now it separates those pairs from this pair other than the fact that they're on a completely different shoe altogether is the fact that those pairs are actually random because it's two different materials injected into a mold together and they create random swirls whereas this shoe is actually a set pattern now for a while i thought that the mx350s were going to have a random primeknit pattern on every single shoe because they were an mx sneaker which thinking about it now would probably be very difficult for adidas to produce logistically i think it'd be really difficult to program their machines to create random patterns on every single sneaker that comes out and the way i found this out obviously is that when i got my pair in the mail i compared my pair to the promotional images on adidas's website and the shoe is exactly the same so while the 350 mx oats are designed to look like they have a randomized pattern on the upper they obviously don't and i'm totally fine with that because i feel like they were able to optimize the color placement and make the shoe look the best that it possibly could now to be fair i've never seen any other pairs other than the pair that i have and the pairs that are on adidas's website so it's possible that maybe different sizes have a different pattern or something like that but this is a size nine and a half i'm pretty sure adidas used a size nine on their website because that's a sample size so i would assume that every pair has the exact same pattern on it tangent aside i think that the upper of this shoe looks incredible i actually love the way that this looks like i said it could be because i'm nostalgic for that sort of weird paint project i used to do when i was like eight years old but i think it looks incredible and apparently this is not the only 350mx colorway that's going to be releasing apparently there's some blue colorway that's dropping later this year which is kind of cool but in this review let's specifically talk about this colorway the oat colorway and starting things off on the toe of the sneaker let's start with the base color of the primeknit so the base color of the shoe or the primary color of the shoe seems to be a light tan or off-white color woven in with the tan primeknit you've also got a yellow primeknit and a red primeknit which kind of create the illusion of flames which i think looks awesome in addition to the tan yellow and red you've actually also got some really bright hits of blue and what's interesting about these blue hits is that they're not actually made up of primeknit they're made of the same sort of mesh material that you find on the side stripe of the shoe and because of that these blue accents are glossy and add this nice little shine to whichever parts of the shoe that they're present on meaning that this shoe has some very cool visual layers to it i don't think the shoe would be as interesting if the blue was just a primeknit i think the fact that they made it a shiny plastic makes this shoe pop just that much more this shoe really reminds me of like sanding a piece of wood the more that you sand the more pieces of grain that you find the more patterns that you find and it really makes the shoe look super interesting and to be honest this is one of the first times that i've really loved both medial and the lateral side of the shoe they're both very different but they both have parts to the design that really make either side stand alone i just think the upper of the shoe has a super cool look and it's one that i didn't expect to like this much i'm going to be honest i thought i was going to get these in and be like it's just another pair of yeezys but now that i have them in hand i'm surprised by how much i like this shoe now with that said i don't know how wearable this shoe is going to be it's definitely a loud sneaker but it's a good looking sneaker at least for sitting on your shelf because that's what most sneaker heads do we put our sneakers on shelves and just kind of wear them once every month so let's be honest most of these might end up being shelf decorations rather than being something that's actually worn and if it's just a shelf decoration it looks great but if it's used for what it's supposed to be used for being worn it might be a little bit harder to pull off as far as the actual feel and stiffness of the primeknit upper it's pretty much exactly the same as every other pair of 350s the only areas that are sort of different are the blue mesh areas and they still feel pretty similar of course in the lateral side of the sneaker you still have that semi-translucent stripe which allows you to see through to your socks underneath and if you're wearing a pair of apothecary socks like you can see me wear in the b-roll shots of this sneaker it makes the shoe look even better and actually i forgot to mention if you win the yeezy giveaway you also win the entire apothecary tonal collection which doesn't come out till october 29th and i don't know which one of those things you want more whether it's the yeezys or the socks maybe you don't want the eases at all maybe you just want the socks it's probably not the case but hey the socks are sick but again the good news is if you win you win both things you don't have to decide there you go moving up in the shoe you've got that seam running down the center of the shoe as you're probably used to by now on pairs of 350 v2s the only difference on this pair is that it seems like oh man that was that was rough it seems like that they've covered up the stitching detail on this shoe which makes sense because the shoe is already pretty crazy as it is then weaving through the upper of the shoe you've got your laces which look like standard rope laces however unlike standard rope laces they actually seem to have this sort of semi-translucent plastic sheath over top of them like the mono 350s did i'm not sure why they decided to do that on this pair i kind of hate these laces because they don't have a lot of friction so when you tie them they don't stay together that well they slide out all the time kind of pisses me off but it is what it is i'm not sure why they didn't go with the infinity lacing system on this shoe they've been doing that on a lot of the newer pairs of 350 v2s not sure why they didn't do it on this pair it seems like it's the best way to go because you just pull the laces and they tighten you can't switch out the laces but it just looks better in my opinion so i don't know it is what it is just to call out some of my favorite parts of the prime upper of this shoe you've got the sunburst detail on the top of the tongue you've got this cool sort of like wave looking thing on the medial side of the shoe i love that on the lateral side of the shoe you've got just really nice sort of red strands that weave through the blue i just think it's a really cool looking sneaker and i like the fact that the right shoe is just a mirrored version of the left shoe it makes the entire shoe more consistent and the pattern of the shoe although crazy look a little bit less crazy then moving inside the sneaker it's pretty much your standard pair of 350 v2s you've got this sort of light tan colored sockliner which matches the primeknit on the upper of the shoe you've got the adidas three stripes on the heel and then rounding off the inside of the sneaker you've got a tan colored insole with the adidas and yeezy branding printed on the heel and sort of an orangey brown now as far as sizing and fit is concerned as you guys can see i went with the size nine and a half i usually go with a size nine but this time around i went with the size nine and a half which is what people usually recommend because they seem to fit a little bit better now what's interesting about this pair is that i may have gone up half size on the wrong pair because adidas actually recommends you go true to size on this pair versus other pairs of 350s where they've recommended going up half a size and i want up half a size on a pair that apparently i should have just gone true to size with i will say though that wearing the shoe up half a size was fine if that's what you usually do in your pairs of yeezys that's fine too i'm not too bothered by it i'm fine with the size nine and a half i wouldn't mind it a size nine either i realize i'm not really giving you a straight answer here but adidas recommends going true to size on this pair i would say you should probably be fine going true to size as long as you don't have super wide feet i would say if you have super wide feet go up half a size and if you're used to going up half a size and yeezys go up half a size in this shoe you'll be fine if not go true to size and you also should be fine i don't know why adidas hasn't used the same last they use on every other pair of yeezys it doesn't make sense to me the shoe is essentially the same why do they keep messing up the sizing but it is what it is again just stop just make it one size and stick with it continuing back in the shoe towards the heel you've got the semi-translucent pull tab which is basically the same exact pull tab that you had in the easy 350 v2 monos it's clear it's made of plastic instead of a knit then moving down on the sneaker you've got that signature ribbed yeezy midsole that comes in a semi-translucent tan color and inside this rubber casing you've got a full length boost midsole and then finally rounding off the sneaker on the bottom of the shoe you've got more of that tan rubber and your cut throughs to the boost so i'm gonna do something a little bit different in this review than i usually do and give this shoe an arbitrary seth rating that's the new rating system that i'm coming up with right now here on the spot and after thoroughly reviewing this pair of yeezy boost 350 v2 mx oats trying it on feeling it feels great looks great i'm gonna give this shoe an arbitrary rating of nice this is probably my favorite new variant of the 350 v2s to release since like the belugas the first 350 v2 i really didn't think i was gonna like this shoe but having it in hand i'm like this is sick this is a really nice sneaker this is a nice sneaker i don't really have like a numbers rating for nice it's somewhere near the top but it's not at the top if that helps um so there you go once again if you would like to grab the 350 v2 mx oat it releases this saturday october 23rd for a retail price of 220 bucks or you can stay tuned and find out how you can win this pair for yourself so i've teamed up with my own sock brand apothecary meaning i've essentially teamed up with myself to give away a pair of yeezys and also the full tonal collection that drops next weekend apothecary makes some of the best socks around and we like to say that they're your sneakers favorite socks because they are they're the best socks to wear with sneakers so to enter my apothecary yeezy giveaway all you have to do is follow

october 28th when we will officially announce the winner the winner will be randomly selected from that post's comments section and the way that we're actually announcing the winner will be a little bit different than usual so the way that the winner will be announced is once we pick the winner we'll put their name in the actual post itself will tag you in that post so that you know that you've won and the reason we're doing that is because in the past i said that i would message the winner and the problem with that is that people create scam accounts and then message people saying that they've won which of course is a huge scam they want you to click a link just never ever click on anything that anyone dm's you because it's probably a scam so in order to avoid that problem altogether the way that we're gonna do this is by tagging the winner in the actual post itself that way they'll be notified that they won they dm us and then that way you know we'll get in contact with you without having people trying to message you saying that you've won when you've definitely not won so moral of the story is if someone that looks like me or looks like my brand apothecary messages you and says you've won you haven't that's a scam don't answer it block it report it do all sort of good stuff because it's happened to me a bunch in the past and it really sucks so once

dSAOkUeIMWw,New Balance 990,"yo Carla here so a couple of days ago I uploaded a sneaker vlog and one of you guys asked if I have ever done a review of the 990 V6 and apparently pala so I I I think I bought this in I'm not sure if it was in Singapore or in Dubai but I've had it for a while now and I have it in the classic gray colorway so panalo very clean very easy to wear very comfortable i have nothing bad to say about the 990 except they are super expensive i mean to illustrate my point so I realized I add this in gray then I thought to myself to make this vlog I'll buy another one so I went to New Balance over at Rockwell usually of size 12s of New Balance sneakers and I got myself a really nice looking V6 as in this is probably the most aesthetically pleasing 990 V6 I have ever seen one of the very best 990 and without even thinking of asking how much I was thinking 990 V6s maybe around 12 13,000 pesos oh my god guys 18,000 something na pala on retail n 990 v6s 18,000 that's almost 20,000 pesos with with the with the bag to carry it on it reached 19,000 pesos flat retail not even resale I what lesson but anyway if someone can explain why It is 19,000 pesos to buy a 990 V6 pair for retail please help me understand anyway so this is the box this the official colorway of this one official colorway but again I'm very happy to say that this is in my size and we will just open it guys so naman ang lin i don't know if the camera captures it properly feeling hind but this isn't triple white this is different shades of white it has an off-white cream midsole it has elements of cream on the upper white shades of silver light gray as in 1900 comment down below but anyway it is super nice and I will enjoy wearing this pair for the next few months cuz I fully intend to maximize my 19,000 pesos from this shoe again it says over here 990 V6 made in the USA that's probably one of the reasons why it is expensive because the 990 series including the one that I showed you this one in gray and the previous versions of the 990 are made in the United States of America therefore probably United States American labor is expensive and that's why I don't know maybe it's that why that's why it's that expensive but anyway comes with extra cream laces so you can rock it with white laces or go for the cream laces this is what the uh other side looks like man i mean this much love this much but I cannot get enough of this just looking at it i can also cannot get over the 19,000,000 pes but anyway so it looks like officially I am deep into New Balance again considering the last few pairs that I have bought one 1080p fresh foams London wide so most of the sneakers I've been buying are New Balance and and Hoka but anyway 19,000 get over so I just wanted to show you another purchase this is from Alpaka this is a new wallet that I bought this is the Alpaka Pro pouch uh with a hook why what is this so it functions as a wallet in an everyday carry uh like pouch so velcro so you can put any uh p any patch that you have so I like patches so that's why one of the reasons why I bought this this kind of like doubles as my wallet and my everyday carry like gear pocket everyday carry so I have like a pen over here i have like a pocket knife um I have keys over here for the I think conduat um and then it just looks really more much more personalized than me um with the velcro pouch uh velcro pouch with the velcro side over here and then if you open this you can put cash as well as multiple cards i think you can put like six cards for either side and R RFID protected and again if you have like a key fob or a key holder for your bag you can attach it to the hook over here para you to secure it wherever you are so this one I you can buy it from Shopee this exact item I will link it down below if you guys want to get it um I think it's a little over 2,000 pesos think of it as like a very slim personal personalizable customizable nice looking thin everyday carry wallet pouch type of gear 2000 something pesos anyway so very short vlog i just wanted to really share with you the the sneakers and the story behind the 19,000 purchase officially making it the most expensive sneaker I have bought this 2025 anyway let's move on i hope you guys are all doing fine i hope you're doing okay this is Carlos signing out peace god bless what's up boom",2025-06-23 14:42:46.937997 UTC
3zpEa1D9lUs,Adidas Samba,yo should I turn that light on behind me let's turn that light on yo what's going on everybody welcome back to a brand new video in today's video we're going over the Adidas sambas we're gonna do a general review talk a little bit about the history and how they became popular and I'll give you guys My overall opinions and let y'all know if they're worth the hype or not so with all that being said let's get right into it now the Adidas sambas have been out for forever over 50 years when I went to pick these up to do a review for you guys I actually had a very difficult time finding them I went to store after store after Store mall after mall and I finally found them in my size so to my surprise the Adidas sambas are pretty popular right now if you don't have a lot of malls or stores near you your best bet is probably going to be online there are a bunch of sizes online so you just gotta wait for it a little bit but if you're going in person and you really like these might be a little bit difficult to find these come with the original Adidas blue box with the three straps running down I went with the size 10 and I gotta say man when I put these things on feet I was surprised not in a good way but I I feel like I could have planned for this a little bit better but it didn't really cross my mind so let me help you all out so if you guys have a wide foot I would highly recommend going up half a size but if your foot's narrow go true to size you'll be fine I think to be safe though half a size up isn't too bad just because the build on the shoe right here is very slim now the uppers of the shoe consist of a variety of materials we have white leather black leather along with this gray suede that wraps around the toe of the shoe I personally love it when there are some variations on the uppers it just makes it look a little bit nicer when you see those three stripes you already know it's Adidas classic logo I do love the hit of gold on that Samba lettering on the side and this rear heel portion kind of reminds me of the top of a back tab on a Jordan 3. come on man y'all see it I see it as far as accessories go you're not going to get any crazy laces with these they just came with the white laces the tongue features a hit of blue and this is a pretty thin leather tongue now as far as comfort goes I would give these maybe like a 7 out of ten six and a half seven out of 10. again the sambas have been out for a very long time so back in the days there wasn't that much cushion in shoes and I'm sure they've made improvements but there's nothing too crazy in terms of comfort now real quick let's talk about the popularity and kind of how these kind of came back in 2022 2023. a lot of celebrities have been rocking these like ASAP Rocky and a few other people I honestly don't keep up with celebrities what is it about the sambas that makes everyone wanna rock it I personally come from a Nike SB background that's how I got into shoes and I've never had a pair of sambas before I would always see it but these never really struck me it never had a wow factor so I never bought a pair until it was time to do a review for you guys I also heard that there's a lot of people on Tick Tock doing some outfit videos showing how to style them and honestly I should have watched a couple of those videos because I threw these on with some different fits the first time I put these on I put some Levi's on they're more of like a slim fit and I think they look all right but I think these shoes look a little bit thin on me I've seen a lot of people pull these off with baggy pants I've tried the super baggy pant look and it doesn't look that great on me but it might look good on you guys I think my favorite fit with this pair right here was my pants from aloe they do have a more wider fit a little bit more baggy look and they're pretty comfortable but just looking at it from like a bird's eye view since these are so slim I feel like my pants take up the majority of the shoe and it just looks weird from my view I prefer more of a chunkier shoes just something a little bit more bulky something that has you know a little bit more wideness to it I personally just think these look funky on me and maybe it's because of my pants or I don't even know although this is a classic Model and it is going for around a hundred dollars retail I'm sorry y'all I'm gonna have to pass I've had them for about two weeks already and I tried my best bro I wore these in the house and I was like okay over time I might understand what the hype is about them but honestly they're not it they're not it for me again I've seen so many people be able to pull these off let me know what you guys think about the Adidas sambas are these a cop or drop do y'all have a pair and am I tripping on my opinion before I film this video I went through all of my trash bags and I found the freaking receipt these are going right back to Shoe Palace man but yeah that's going to wrap up my honest review and opinions of the Adidas sambas they're just not they're just not it for me but I have seen a lot of people pull them off and they look cool on other people but that's it I hope you guys enjoyed this quick review don't forget to smash the like button and subscribe if you're not subscribed already and I'll see you guys very soon for the next video

inCCTFOgQDA,Adidas Gazelle,yo what is good everyone and thank you so much for stopping by the channel for today's video I wanted to feature a pair of sneakers affordable sneakers that I believe is worth adding to your wardrobe now amidst all the hype and trending Footwear featured here on the channel I definitely considered it uh kind of back and forth to go ahead and make this video happen simply due to the fact that I don't think that this video will do or perform very well however in that very same light I feel like it would be a total disservice to you to not go ahead and make this video happen just because these sneakers here have been a heavy heavy part of my sneaker rotation now I wouldn't necessarily call them my everyday but I would definitely go as far as to say that they are my almost every days yo what is good guys and pardon the interruption just before we go any further in today's video and I expound a little bit more on these almost everyday sneakers I did want to give a special thank you and shout out to today's sponsor keeps now if you didn't already know two out of every three men will experience a noticeable amount of hair loss by the age of 35 which is a majority of us the keep system is designed to prevent and in some cases reverse the effects of male pattern baldness now this isn't another baseless claim and a sponsored ad because I'm a legitimate customer and I can confidently say that keeps works as a matter of fact a link below is my full testimonial video of my hair loss journey and how I use keeps to recover it when it comes to hair loss reversing it is very rare So prevention is key hit the link at the top of the description to visit the keeps site and to get a full rundown including keeps best offer available available they appreciated that testimonial video that I kind of hinted at so it's a product of that they were giving us the best promotional offer thank you once again to keeps for making this video possible and now without further Ado let's go ahead and jump right back into the sneakers at hands now if you have been following me on Instagram on my stories or even on my posts then you probably already know I've been really really wearing a lot of Adidas Classics namely the sambas and the gazelles now there is a few reasons for this but the main reason being predominantly based on the fact that I'm seeing ones fours and dunks literally everywhere I go and truth be told I've kind of grown a little bit stale to them at least just for right now I mean living out here in Southern California will quickly notice that a lot of dudes wear these shoes and they leave their house with like this like I'm Different a personality when in retrospect we're pretty much all dressing the same so from time to time it's kind of nice to just switch things up and I've really leaned into this more sleekly shaped Adidas silhouette with baggier bottoms and it's just something I thought I would share with you but yeah as I've already mentioned I don't anticipate this doing very well however I do have a stronger conviction inside of me that wants to share with you guys what I'm actually wearing so with that these are the Adidas gazelle indoors originally first introduced in 1966 at Adidas gazelle made itself a household name through being on the feet of household names this Timeless sneaker has been seen on the feet but not limited to the likes of Oasis Kate Moss and the young Michael Jackson hitting Peaks and valleys the Adidas gazelle has remained a constant source of Footwear for Generations why the gazelle now I believe that it's due to the heavy PR on the part of Adidas to go ahead and make this shoe the predecessor to the classic and Timeless Stan Smith this is an excellent sneaker that can serve as a bit of a filler shoe to go ahead and keep up with today's latest trends now that baggy bottoms are heavily heavily leaned into it makes perfect sense why Adidas decided to go with the Adidas gazelle as a matter of fact Adidas believes in this silhouette so much that Adidas is now preparing to drop their second release of their highly successful collaboration with Gucci all centered around a special sneaker that is none other than the Adidas gazelle which does lead us to the Adidas gazelle indoor or the sneaker that we have here Gucci's Italian iteration of the gazelle is priced at a whopping 850 dollars and that's if you're able to get them for retail because they sell out very quickly I've been on the hunt for the OG burgundy pair or green and I have a person that works at Gucci that cannot get my size in that shoe not to allow any finances to be unaccounted for Adidas made a redrop of the Adidas gazelle indoor available think of the indoor variation as an elevated take on the standard gazelle with a higher price tag but not as high as the Gucci collab the Adidas gazelle is now offered in Bluebird core black and Scarlet Red with more colors to come I personally ended up picking up Bluebird and core black as you can see but I definitely considered picking up Scarlett as a simple lace swap from Amazon could make these a really good alternative to the very difficult to find whales Bonner Samba this specific gazelle iteration the Endor is a Revival of a sneaker originally released in a 1979 and with this pair just like you got on the first release you get a special box impressively soft to the touch suede a translucent gum sole unit tonal embossed leather tongue and soft leather ankle lining compared to the standard pair you'll see a significant jump up in terms of quality at a price point that isn't too bad as the MSRP on these shoes is 150 bucks a slight markup from the standard gazelles as for sizing I do recommend going true to size for me personally I range anywhere from eight and a half to a nine a nine predominantly in Adidas these are nine and they fit perfectly alright guys so what is the final verdict on the Adidas gazelle indoor are they a sneaker that you can see yourself adding to your rotation are they a potential good alternative to the very expensive and hard to find Gucci collab or am I just over hyping a rather simple sneaker I definitely love to hear what you have to say in the comment section down below and of course if you did enjoy today's video please be sure to communicate that to me by liking today's video

E4ZMOYsyadc,Onitsuka Mexico 66,yo what up sneaker enthusiasts welcome back to my channel where I'll be diving deep into the world of kicks today we have an epic showdown between two iconic sneakers that have been making waves for decades it's the ultimate Face-Off the Adidas Samba versus the onasuka tiger Mexico 66 both in the classic black and white colorway let's jump right to it first up let's talk about the Adidas Samba these kicks are a true classic first introduced in the 50s as an indoor soccer shoe but don't let their Origins fool you the sambas have become a Timeless streetwear sneaker the black and white colorway is a Sleek combination that goes with everything the black leather upper exudes a scent of sophistication while the white three stripes and iconic Samba branding as a touch of Adidas flare these kicks are all about blending sporty Vibes with casual coolness not only do the sambas look great but they also perform like Champs the durable leather construction and grippy rubber outsole provides excellent support and traction making them perfect for everyday wear or even a friendly game of footy in terms of pricing they did a Samba typically ranges from 80 to 100 dollars USD depending on the retailer and any special editions or collaborations that might be available now let's turn our attention to the honor secret tiger Mexico 66. these kicks are an absolute Legend in a sneaker game originally designed for the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City talk about history on your feet in the black and white colorway the Mexico 66 exudes retro coolness the combination of black suede on white leather creates a style contrast that catches the eye the iconic honestly good tiger stripes on the sides adds that unmistakable Touch of vintage charm when it comes to pricing the onasuga tiger Mexico 66 is usually priced around 80 to 100 depending on the specific addition or any premium materials used but it's not all about Lux with the Mexico 66. these sneakers are built with comfort and performance the cushioned insole and flexible soil makes them a joy to walk in while the support of arch ensures that your feet stay happy all day long Alright It's time for The Showdown let's compare these two iconic kicks side by side when it comes to style the Adidas Samba delivers at a Timeless sporty Vibe while the honest Secret tiger mystical 66 brings that retro flare both the black and white colorways offer versatility and easy pairing with any outfit in terms of performance the sambas offer durable leather construction and excellent traction perfect for both Urban exploration and the occasional soccer match on the other hand the Mexico 66 focuses on comfort with its cushions insole and flexibility making a tough choice for long walks or everyday activities in fact when I was wearing the onusuku tiger Mexico 66 the arch support feels great it provides that extra level of comfort and stability which is great for those who require more arch support another notable feature of the Mexico 66 is its lightweight construction the lightweight nature of the Mexico 66 allows for enhanced agility and freedom of movement it's perfect for those who prefer a lighter feel on their feet whether you're strolling around the city or hitting the Dance Floor the lightness can make you feel more Nimble and less fatigued during extended periods of wear however it's important to note that the lighter weight of the Mexico 66 may result in slightly less durability compared to the sturdier build of the Adidas zombas so if you tend to put your kicks to rugged activities or if you prioritize long-term durability you may want to consider the data sambas as a more suitable option as for pricing both sneakers fall within a similar range with the data sambas and the honestly good tag in Mexico 66 priced at around 80 to 100 making them accessible options for sneaker enthusiasts so just remember what may work for me might be different for you it's important to try them on and see which pair feels the most comfortable supportive and suited to your specific needs so go ahead give them a test run and see which sneaker wins in terms of comfort style and weight but if I had to choose one I'd pick the idea to Samba due to its Timeless design and sporty Vibe it just speaks really well to my personal style and the durable leather construction offers a perfect combination of comfort and flexibility and I just like how the Adidas sambas is a little bit more durable than the Mexico 66 and there you have it folks the epic face off between Adidas Samba and the anasuka tiger Mexico 66. both sneakers bring their own unique Flair to the table whether it's a sporty Elegance of the sambas or the Retro charm of the Mexico 66 and to help you guys out I'll link both sneakers in the description below so you guys can cop them after the video remember sneaker heads it's not about choosing a winner but finding the kicks that resonate with your

8fabHYEslWM,Converse Chuck Taylor All Star,"yo what's up guys it's Nathan and today we've got a new review you already know what it is by the title but nonetheless it is of the Commerce truck Tor Allstar 2 the ones that have been given the Luna long soul that is the main big difference with these shoes except a few aesthetic cosmetic sort of things which I will cover in the review so let's get in just a heads up during the review if you do hear banging soaring noises General construction sounds I am getting the kitchen done at my house at the minute and the guy's here now so there you go that explains it so there would have been an unboxing video for this however I didn't order them offline purely because of my issues with convers in the past anytime I've worn Converse I found that they've been really narrow so I was thinking about going half size up but I didn't want to take the risk because I'm not that into mid top high top shoes so I won't show how they look so went into the shop and had a look instead and uh this is the box that you get I don't know what the original box does look like so I can't compare but this is it so as you can see on the box this is a men's eight a women's 10 this is a unisex shoe and it's in the black and white colorway so as you can probably tell this is your standard sort of lift up top box the real classic style without a hinge sort of thing the shoes aren't in the Box I didn't get an empty box just so you know you get a spare lace in here you get the black laces in them you've also got your tissue paper with the two and the Converse logo on it and that's pretty much it so as I've said highs and mid to shoes aren't really my kind of shoe but here they are they're exceptionally clean and I really do like them so that makes a change so to cover a few of the Cosmetic differences between the originals and these these don't have the red line that runs across the top of them I believe it's red uh you don't have the blue one or the black one that runs on the midsole the Chuck tayor B is completely embroidered and I do actually prefer it in all one color like that is you also don't have the contrasting stitching up these parts that the originals do have on a lot of them so down to the kind of performance side of the shoe this is a perforated suede nonslip Tong it also has padding in it uh and I have tried these on as I said in the shop and they are actually preferable to The Originals they are a lot comfier to all you people that hate the tongue of the old Converse sliding to the left sliding to the right that's long gone no more they've got you covered with that I can't get it on camera but you'll have to take my word for it there's two like elastic Parts here that basically keep the tongue centered and it's literally basically impossible for it to slip down the sides when you're wearing them really cool cuz I don't I don't like that on the originals now for the thing that most of the advertisings orientated around and all you really hear about is the Nik lunal Lon soul that theyve put in there um all I've heard is mostly good things about this in regards to skateboarding shoes that Nike have produced in the past I know these are subsidiary company of uh Nike much like Jordan brand and stuff like that so if you're surprised there's a Nike insult in there there you go learn something new every day as I've already said from my experience I find Converse to be quite narrow and uncomfortable mostly because of the narrowness but also because of discomfort on the bottom of your feet so this so it seems like it's going to actually help uh I wouldn't bought them otherwise so I tried these on in the shop because of my past experience with them and I did end up going half size up I literally couldn't get my foot into the 7.5 my feet got to about here and then stopped so I did go half size up it's a lot more roomy at the end but they are tight to the sides of my feet um although they have got the sole and although I have gone off size up I can't imagine wearing these and it's still being comfortable over the length of a day so we will find out though another little thing I did like about these shoes is the choice of the black and white laces they are a very plain shoe in the black colorway but I think they do look really clean I did in fact put the white laces in as soon as I got them and I looked like I going back to about 2008 going through an emo phase so I changed them back to black to give them a more flush black top to the white bottom and surprisingly although these are a company partnered with Nike there are no glue problems anywhere this goes to show night do it on purpose now honestly though I don't know but you've got this premium canvas and if glue got on this it'd be so obvious that it was there so I think they've taken Extra Care with it the only actual glue Mark I have got on these shoes is in the tongue and as you can see there's no need for glue in there it's mostly stitching well done Nik so in my opinion these are a really really clean shoe and with the growing popularity of the kind of like shell toe sort of thing like this uh I think these are going to blow up much like the old ones did if not more so because of the Comfort um stuff like that so yeah uh I do highly rate this pair I can't lie so I would normally do an on foot section here but unfortunately I'm unable to because of the mass amounts of kitchen utensils and utilities outside in my backyard so um I'm going to end the review here if you got any questions about the shoe or about anything I have talked about today just drop it in the comments below and I'll get back to you as soon as as I can um but in the meantime don't forget to like comment and subscribe going to try and

ZqHATun9W1I,Nike Air Max 90,you know i was thinking about this the other day and velcro shoes they're actually a ripoff get it hello there bo skis erk the turk hassan back here with another yes another air max sneaker 2 review and it is my favorite silhouette of all time so i just had to do it on today's episode we are reviewing the nike air max 90 in all white now if you haven't guessed already from the b-roll shots this pair isn't actually mine for this colorway i couldn't actually get my size so in the end i just got my mrs a pair so of course the b-roll shots is her so don't think my feet are shrunk or anything like that now i will leave some links down below as well so as soon as the restocks happen they will hopefully be there nike normally restock when the weather gets a little warmer so fingers and toes crossed that's what they do so the air max 90 where do i start the air max that made me fall in love it wasn't my first air max but it was the one that sparked it all and the infrared air max 90 for me is the greatest shoe ever made i really don't care what anyone else has to say to be honest i just love everything about it the colorway how they feel and of course how you can style them of course this is all about the triple white colorway and this is a very popular one especially for the summer a crisp white tee some grey shorts maybe some white socks even and these bad boys on those whatsit toes for me there aren't that many triple white air maxes out there that look better than this but let's take a look at the box and i know you've already seen it but it's just a formality now of course the box it comes in is your gr red and white nike box so nothing too exciting there but on the product sticker it does say air max 90 and the official colorway is white white and wolf gray now i am currently working on an all white top 10 nike sneakers list and of course this is defo making that one i'm not quite sure yet where these do rank but they are defo up there but with all that said let's talk a little bit about the sizing now i know technically i can't really have my two pence on the sizing with this particular pair but according to my misses these are a true to size fit in my personal experience with the air max 90s in the men's sizing they are a true to size for me as well so whatever sizing i do get with the 90s i go with the dunks the jordan ones the air max 95 the air max ones and so on so short story long these are a true to size now let's see whether this air max 90 might just be for you let's take an even closer look now the beauty in the max 90 is in its simplicity and this one just shows why less is more sometimes the overlays are of course in this level and the underlays are in this mesh so breathability won't be that much of an issue for the summer days we've got the symmetrical look to the air max panels on that tpu material and the same with the nike swoosh on both the lateral and medial sides the only thing i can say straight away is the mesh panels might be a bit tricky to keep clean so just be a little bit careful with those panels more so than anything now the lacing is very traditional to the air max 90 setup here of course we've got the eye stays on those tpu panels again and these do come with flat white laces now the tongue mostly is on this nylon material and just on top of it is the nike air max branding in that white patch now we've got this ankle collar in this soft cotton fill and on the insole it's in white again with the nike gray air max brand in there too now the hill counter this for me is one of the standout parts of any air max 90. it is of course the nike air branding on that tpu panel now the mod guards are in the same material as the other overlays and to be fair it does blend in well on some air max 90s they use different materials so it does change it up here some might say it's a little too plain but for me it's just nice and simple now the midsole of course is in a white and even the air unit is in white as well now the outsole to the air max 90 of course this is so iconic it's got that waffle design that we do know and love in this all white finish in the words of jay z less is more and this is exactly what the air max 90 does need for like some sneakers in white just ruin it with hints of grey or even a light blue but just like walkers these are crisp but broskies we've come to that part of the video where i do have to decide whether these are a buy or a buy now i know we are spoiled for choice when it comes to all white sneakers whether it is from nike or other brands as well and just like a gangbang there is some stiff competition but as an air max 90 fanboy i cannot fault this sneaker at all yes the mesh panels might need some more attention but that's the only thing i can really say these will go with so many different outfits especially it being an air max 19 and the simplicity to the materials used and of course the colorway you can't really say no and of course the only downside is is maybe trying to get your hands on a pair but let's hope there are some restocks closer to when it gets warm overall both skis there aren't many sneakers that can beat this in all whites i am indeed going to give the air max 90 triple whites an absolute but leave it down below what your thoughts are on the air max 90 in triple whites is this a summer essential or do you have a nike sneaker in all white that you prefer leave all down below and i will be pinning the best one anyways my bros keys thank you for watching thank you for stopping by and don't forget to hit me up on the ig as well because i am most active over there and don't forget to like subscribe comment and share and until the next episode see you later alligator

a0HJarVvJzg,New balance 550,you know malls are dying but going into them every once in a while you will find some good hey what's good guys my name is Chris welcome back to the official wear testers.com YouTube channel today we got something that I find to be one of the most interesting Retros in quite a while like we obviously know about all the Jordan brand stuff happens all the time weekly in fact and then we've had some other random Retros from other random Brands like the Feld of Grant Hills the Reebok Pump stuff some of the Iverson stuff even the Shak nosis if you want to throw that in there here or there and even Puma like Puma's got their Ralph Samson shoe and they've done the palace guard OG New Balance though has dug way into the archives 1989 in fact and they've dug these guys out right here this is the 550 originally in 1989 though they were known as the p550 this is an old school basketball shoe that nobody remembers I I think that this is the most interesting retro that we've had in so long because there's like no Nostalgia with this but it's such a dope shoe they just seemed to have kind of slid in by they I mean New Balance just slid into the basketball retro Market unnoticed like no wonder Nike brick right now everybody's going for these things they're hard as to find and like I said they were just sitting on the Shelf at Foot Locker in the Mall there was two others that were just like these but instead of the purple accents there were I think it was like forest green and the other one was a really dark Navy it almost looked black but it was a navy blue I liked all three of them I think that this shoe actually looks great in every color we Absol now as far as the tech is concerned concerned and the quality of the shoe I'll just go over craftsmanship first these are flawless flawless flawless Nike Flawless okay I got some Nikes back here or where are they no they're over there and we will talk about them later quite possibly the worst retro of 20121 stay tuned for that well they had to top that flight shoe from 2020 and it's another flight shoe why do you guys do this to my beloved flights anyways the craftsmanship on these guys Flawless every pair on the Shelf Flawless there wasn't a bad one that I saw crazy now the tech features on this shoe are really interesting because well there are none it's from 1989 this is something that I always think is interesting so this shoe the palace guard OG from Puma the Reebok joints and then there was these all of which were so far separated from the tech that was in the 1989 Air Jordan or Air flight with air in it you know what I mean so it's really interesting to see these shoes and what they're made like because it just shows at least back then how far ahead this small little brand named Nike actually was cuz they were kind of the New Kids on the Block it's really weird that they were the ones that really you know as soon as they got an air bubble in their shoes man that was over so anyways like I was saying these guys really have no Tech you have a rubber cup sole what was the shoe oh it was those back there that video right there and that shoe that Nike shoe above the penny uh those are a pair of Sonic flights from 1992 it was my first name brand sneaker and all that stuff if you want to hear the story click on the video thumbnails right there but that shoe and this shoe damn near identical the only difference is that those have air in the heel and these don't so all of this is a rubber cupsole it's stitched on at the toe it's also stitched on at the heel which I thought was really interesting so extra reinforcement almost like a cupsole that you would see on a Jordan 1 or Air Force and all that stuff however on the inside you can actually see where it's exposed just like the old rebok joints or the Adidas Continental 80s and all of that where there is an Eva wedge inside so that's the tech that's in the shoe that's all the cushion that these guys had in 89 unless you're wearing an air product however this is probably the most interesting thing about these things inside look at this that's not an original feature okay this is ortholite right here they actually have their little branding tag on there letting you know and I thought this was really interesting it actually made me go and look up when ortholite was made or founded or whatever as a company 1997 so 89 to 97 there's a big ass Gap so this clearly wasn't in the originals I do wonder what was in The Originals I'm assuming it was a polyurethane insole but I really don't know so anyways we have the ortholite insole with this kind of like extra additional Eva portion that has a little bit of an art support in there it actually says New Balance art support nice little liner when you put these on they are really comfortable but it is from this so it's not you know the shoe itself it's from the insole itself probably won't last too long despite what their little card says right here it says long-term cushioning and I'm just like I've been using ortholite for a long ass time and that bottoms out pretty fast so longterm my butt but there are plenty of additional insole options these are clearly removable so if you have a favorite insole you could slap it in here call it a day inside though I thought it was really interesting man board last that's cool so Not only was there the extra reinforcement from all of the extra stitching all the overlays on the upper but then there's also a board last in there for tortional support I tried my hardest to find Who would wear these in 1989 did you know that the NBA was filled with Adidas Converse and some Nikes that was it and then there was this guy named MJ and he was flying around wearing his own shoe I only found one dude wearing new balances in the NBA at that point in time that I found that I I gave up looking so that I'm sure that there was more and it was Charles Oakley during this season the 89 it was actually from 88 to '89 he was a bull and then he went over to the New York Knicks a lot of people already know this but in that time frame even as a bull he was wearing these high top New Balance basketball shoes same shoe when he went over to New York for his first year I believe he ended up going with Nike eventually but that basketball shoe was similar looking to this but it wasn't that like I was like staring you know analyzing all that stuff not the same shoe but I did think it was really interesting that out of all the athletes I can find one that was wearing New Balance so that's why I think these are so interesting because they're kicking ass on the Sal side but nobody knows about this like what is it this reminds me of the Air Jordan 4 for me where my Nostalgia stuff with MJ as a fan really kicked off when I started watching him so during the Air Jordan 10 The Comeback season and all the way onwards but the Air Jordan 4 is my favorite shoe why you were so young you didn't watch them I don't know there's something about it they're pretty I really like those that's what I feel like this shoe is for New Balance where it's like why do you like these who wore them I know they look cool though so I think that that's what it is now the upper on these guys that's the part where I'm a little bit disappointed new balance is really known for Quality materials and quality craftsmanship they definitely have the craftsmanship here the materials just aren't great I know that there are collab versions of the shoe that have better materials on them but still new balance is known as a gr shoe that they got good it's not a Nike thing where you're surprised when there's a good material on like a you know what I mean it's not like that normally New Balance gives you the goods right from the jump they are Leathers they're just really thin Cuts really cheap pieces on top of that the nicest leather is probably right here on the toe but even then the word nicest is like used just liberally it's not like really good or anything like that there's a couple of synthetic panels mostly the colored sections like the purple and the logo and stuff like that nothing crazy the nicest material is the toe cap the gray suede this is such a weird look for me I like things to be like really symmetrical so New Balance has always done this weird toe and it doesn't bother me it's just one of those things that like I'm fixated on like it draws my attention in every time now as far as sizing is concerned they actually fit pretty snug but they do fit true to size uh I got my regular size they fit perfectly one to one the way that I like my shoes to fit however if you did want a little bit of wiggle room you might want to go up half a size and again this insole is removable so if you take this out and put in a thinner one or a thicker one that can alter things so if you happen to see these in store and you know that you are interested in them I'm not saying to always carry your insole around with you but if you happen to have you can always swap it out and just see how they fit before you purchase now what do you think these look like a basketball shoe that you would wear they do I like them I like the look of them I didn't even bother though to be like o do they come in my size because I had picked up my very own pair of New Balances the day before coincidentally and so when he like grabbed these off the shelf I was like oh what were you jealous of mine and so I had to explain to her how difficult it's been to try and get a pair of these cuz I refused to pay for these over retail so like I was just like what the hell like they're just sitting here on the shelf I couldn't believe it so I forgot to talk about the traction real quick that does not look like it would grip it just doesn't it feels very sticky though it feels grippy it just doesn't look like it would grip so I just think this is a really interesting shoe very interesting and heavy well it's a full-on cup sole I'm just saying I pulled off a pair of Air Force Ones off the shelf yesterday and I'm surprised they didn't fly out of my hand they were so light those were not real Air Forces okay I was telling him he could be twinsies with Drew so if you want to go check out Drew WI Instagram account yeah I I don't remember what type of air force it was but it was one of the newer ones like with like new tech and Hollow soul and all that stuff no rubber yeah um yeah so those aren't Air Forces even though they are they are but anyway sound off below and let us know what you think about the New Balance 550 also if you remember anybody that actually played in these like and I'm not talking about like friends or family I'm talking about like an NBA guy I'd like to know who hey I'd like to know if your uncle played in them you tell me she's being very factious right now um so uh yeah I would like to know an actual player that wore these that is of some sort of significance you know what I mean so uh but maybe there isn't one I don't know but thank you so much for watching thanks for all the support sound off below and let

ygbBTV6ZuJE,ASICS GEL-LYTE III,you know what's going on guys DDS here I've got a video review for you guys today and this is on some Asics of all things and these are the gel like threes totally forgot I even got these sneakers guys I ended up winning these in a raffle from the beta new store and so big shout out to my riding staff for collective kicks comm one of the people wrote an article and I retweeted his article so hopefully some of you guys saw this and we're able to get these shoes if you guys did get these shoes for my article please leave a comment let me know but he wrote an article about these shoes that I believe they're called the Vanquish and it was a raffle from bait me or bait the bait store or whatever it is and I mean this as much as much as I know I'm super noob to any of this stuff but I actually like this model and I wanted to see what they look like in person because the quality looks crazy I always see all these dope pictures and reviews from other people on YouTube and they look pretty cool so I wanted to check them out filled out the form and ended up winning the raffle and I totally didn't think I was actually gonna win this raffle and and I want it and then it said that I had to check out by a certain time so basically it won the raffle it gave me a link and I clicked that link took me to a checkout page and you had to check out by a specific time well I didn't check out by that time I didn't see the email in time so I totally thought I wasn't gonna get him filled it out anyway and it looked like it submitted that I totally forgot about the release was on to some other Nike releases and whatnot through the week and then these showed up in the mail so I was like dude this is crazy like so I was looking over these shoes and the the quality of these are ridiculous like look at this suede I mean the price point on these were 150 new I'll give you guys kind of a full look it's a six and there's this metal mesh around the shoe along with the the camo and I really thought that was cool I thought it was kind of neat how this is speckled but it's only speckled in the middle area not on the entire midsole and the red the red just pops out to me and I think that's what I like the most about the sneaker is that it's like a camo print shoe and it has a little bit of mesh or metal mesh or whatever you want to call it right here and there and then then you have this this crazy red accent to the shoe and it just really adds a lot to it but the the black suede on here is really really nice as you can see it's really like rugged so I thought these were kind of crazy you could see waxed round laces on here right here and this is the thing that I thought was interesting this is reason why I wanted to get him in person because I've never seen these in person I honestly haven't had that much of an interest there's a couple here and there that have caught my attention look at this tongue it's a split tongue I had no idea and some of you guys are like oh my god hisses such a noob yep admit it I'm raising my hand right now here I'm raising my hand um right here or ismahan uh yeah I'm a super noob with any of this stuff and and I'm not trying to get into this subculture too much I mean honestly there's stuff that looks kind of neat and and I want to know more about it for the most part I don't purchase those things because I don't even know how to purchase that's why the website thing was really cool for me because having collective kicks com lets me kind of wants to explore a little bit more and having the link from one of my other writers who covered this it made it so I was able to get these shoes now they also have the red wax laces and speaking of my writers just a heads up to them and to you guys I'm planning on getting some live chats rolling soon it's for the website called kick casts and what I'm gonna do is host it through YouTube and just do kind of like the roundtable sort of thing that people do usually do for sneakers but most of my stuff is going to be topic oriented like a specific chat about a specific topic and that's pretty much it with one or a couple of people and then I'll definitely have a panel for just my collective kicks staff so look for those in the future here I'm gonna be trying I wanted to get them done in December but honestly I don't know how to do the live chat thing I'm working on that and then I'll get it figured out looking at the box right here you can see the the box is my size 9.5 and this is all the colors they're made in Vietnam as you can see and it says blocking camo and again I really like the camo on this this shoe I thought it was a dope combination between the camo and the red and all in all I'm happy with being able to pick these up um I honestly 100% I'm not sure if I'm gonna be keeping these in which is it's hard to say in and I don't even want to admit it because I might have somebody that wants these more than myself and I might be some of them to them so if I do a collection video and you know I don't have these don't be like oh my god has to sell I just being honest I'm not sure if I'm gonna be keeping these ones in the collection or not if I had to am I definitely would but somebody else has expressed a lot of a lot of interest in them and and it would probably do more you know more good in their hands and in mine but it is cool for me at the very very least to see them in person and get an idea of what these shoes are all about and what all kind of hype is one thing I really like is this the mid tools in here are so squishy and it reminds me of like an old Nike midsole how it's like really like the old what was it like the bo Jackson's and stuff like that's I mentioned there's some previous videos and how I like that the bo Jackson's were like really squishy and on the midsole area and it made me feel like it's air even though it really wasn't but I like the cushioning but that's pretty much it I just want to give you guys a video review of these and expect maybe to see some more I mean I'm definitely curious about this kind of subculture I haven't tried these ones on the next pair I actually get so 2014 is gonna be a year where I kind of open up a little bit and explore outside of Nike and Jordan Brand a little bit you know and I do want to try a pair of aged six and I do want to try a pair of New Balances and I want to be to wear them more than just a couple times as a daily runners and see how the comfort is leave a comment if you guys have any specific models that you guys think are the most comfortable because really I'm not looking for aesthetics I'm looking for comfort I'm not looking for eliminated I'm looking for the quality of the build and in comfort so if you have an a6 or a New Balance model that is your favorite please leave a comment below that's pretty much all we have for this video I also like these these are Christmas colors got that green and red going on

QGdUtnXkVyc,Nike Cortez,you're watching suture Shot TV and today we have the Nike Cortez these are the Nike Cortez one of Nike's most iconic silhouettes of all time they feature a nylon tongue with this white Nike Swoosh on the top of the tongue tag that's stitched on they come with flat black laces that have a metallic Nike Swoosh dubray at the bottom they do have suede overlays for the eyelids with the rigid outline going around it that extends to the suede on the toe box taking us to the side panels you have this nylon upper and over that you have these giant white Nike swooshes and synthetic leather taking it to the back of the heel you have the synthetic leather overlay with that classic Nike logo embroidered on in black on top of the swoosh underneath that you have more suede for the heel cup taking this to the midsole you have a two-tone foam midsole in white and black and then taking us to the outsole you have that classic Cortez herringbone traction with the Nike Swoosh in the middle the Nike Cortez is one of Nike's most iconic sneakers of their entire history for those of you who might not know they were designed by Nike co-founder legendary Bill Bowerman with the intention of Designing something that was going to be durable yet comfortable they originally released back in 1972 in the Olympians of the time really loved them because of the Comfort level that they provided they Rose to popularity in the mid 80s due to the combination of Southern California's gang culture and legendary rap group NWA producer of the show c-rock has a Viv memory back in grade school when he remembers classmates kicking the ball over the fence during kickball and the common denominator between all the kids was that they were all wearing the Nike Cortez he wanted to do the same so he's been looking for this specific colorway ever since fortunately they came back out in 2023 and over the years we've got countless collaborations with artists like Mr cartoon and Kendrick Lamar they've even collaborated with other brands such as clot where they did the overlay on the red white and blue pair and then Sakai where they even added some see-through visible air unit and we even got Union Los Angeles collaboration with some crazy colors you guys might remember remember some of the iconic moments of the Cortez and pop culture we already mentioned NWA Easy E was always seen in a pair of Nike Cortez you might remember the movie Forrest Gump where Forrest Gump ran a 15 000 mile marathon in a pair of Cortez the red white and blue pair that he was gifted from Jenny or you also might remember Whitney Houston wearing these during the halftime show or the 1991 Super Bowl the Nike Cortez seems to always be readily available they have a bunch of versions with the leather upper but the version that we really love over here at shooter Shot TV is the classics with the nylon upper these released on August 4th in the black and white colorway and the Navy and white colorway they were exclusive to women but they did go up to a men's 10 and a half the bigger sizes sold out pretty quickly but if you do your due diligence you might be able to find them for retail or a little bit over retail hopefully Nike brings them back in full men's sizing children as well would love to get these for my kids it's a great shoe they retailed at a price point of 90 dollars as far as comfort goes the Cortez tends to run a little narrow so we did go a half size up you can definitely feel the cushion from the foam midsole and the thing we love most about the nylon version is that it gives a little bit more flexibility in the forefoot compared to its leather counterparts where your foot feels a little bit more restricted the nylon version does feel lighter as well and as far as style goes we already mentioned how classic how iconic the silhouette is 1972 was 41 years ago but it's still something that holds up to this day classic design by Bill Bowerman rest in peace and it's crazy to think that this shoe is still popular 41 years later back in the day they were a little problematic depending on where you lived now in 2023 you know less press ratio in a world where everyone's just trying to get along can't go wrong with the Nike Cortez but how do you guys feel about the Nike Cortez were you waiting for the nylon version to come back out like we were or do you prefer the leather version let us know in the comments below and if you haven't already be sure to like And subscribe we appreciate all the support let's go ahead and try these on [Applause] if you enjoyed this review on the classic Nike Cortez make sure you check out all our other vintage Nike reviews as well we got a bunch for you guys make sure you hit that like And subscribe as well and we'll catch you on the next episode and on a snap don't,2025-06-23 11:22:06.498950 UTC
8lLDNK_oq-M,PUMA Suede,zakaboo sneaker reviews welcome to the channel my name is zach you can call me zackaboo and i'm here for you and any sneakers that you might be curious about no brand snobbing no shaming whatsoever now before anything else i gotta give credit where credit's due puma's been enjoying somewhat of a resurgence over the past couple of years in the sneaker scene with the recent models such as the rsx and some of the newer basketball stuff some of said newer stuff might just be classics in the future but you can't deny these might just be the most iconic sneaker that pumbaa's ever put out this my friends is the puma suede there's so much history with this particular model man it's insane if i were really to get into the details of the history behind the shoe i might end up making a 30 minute video and really that's just way too long so i'm just gonna give you a quick version of the background story behind the shoe and we'll be taking a look into it as well with over 50 years of life in a shoe the suede became a classic while going through several names beginning as the puma crack the shoe evolved into the clyde then puma states and finally globally adopted the name puma suede to shorten the story the suede was first named the crack because it was a popular term used back in the day to describe someone who was you guessed it absolutely cracked at something in gamer terms it basically means someone with far superior skills when nba player walt clyde fraser signed with puma understandably that was the time when the shoe was named the puma clyde basically making walt frazier the first basketball player to have a signature shoe it was said he wanted a new colorway every single game which eventually prompted the folks over puma to use suede since it was easier to make several different colorways at the start of the 80s though it was mostly break dancers and the hip hop scene in the us which carried on the legacy of the shoe which resulted in puma renaming it yet again to the puma states but eventually puma just decided to name it the suede with a little help from the skateboarding community and i think that name's probably gonna stick moving forward i told you man long history i tried to shorten it as best as i could but if you fast forwarded that part of the video and now you're here that's perfectly understandable let's go ahead and take a look at the shoe i think the name puma suede is pretty self-explanatory it's an all suede upper is it the best quality suede you'll ever see no but for what it's worth it looks great and feels really good little to no break in time needed as is the case with classic shoes like this don't expect cushion to be anywhere near the shoes you'll find today it's a rubber cup sole which basically means pretty stiff a little bottom heavy but durable enough to last you quite a while which is probably why i was favored by dancers and skaters back in the day going over the fit and i feel like these fit true to size i wore a 9.5 for most lifestyle shoes and a 9.5 worked well for me wide footers might want to go up half a size but if there are any wide footers watching this video then please please leave your experiences in the comments section so we can help others who want to try these and that's just about it for my review of the puma suede it's a classic model what can i say and it's right up there with the likes of the adidas stan smith the adidas superstar reebok club c85s or the nike blazer but you guys get the picture i think the closest possible shoe you can find to these guys would be the adidas campus same build same materials different logo and i'll tell you what these guys have daily beater status affordable stylish durable not the most comfortable shoe but they do break in pretty nicely matter of fact i don't think there's even any break in time with these things at all my personal favorite part about these guys is that you can literally walk into any puma store or find them online and they won't be sold out at least in my experience i think these go for somewhere around eighty dollars that's a little over four thousand pesos so i will try leaving a link for it in the description box down below but i'm pretty sure you can also find them in store just please remember to stay safe now if you found this video helpful or if you just like the content in general then by all means please hit that thumbs up button it really goes a long way consider subscribing if you haven't already enable post notifications and share my videos with your friends so we get a nice community going on and yes there will also be more giveaways in the future as long as we keep this channel and its subscriber count growing so please help me out my name is zach you can call me zakaboo thank you so much for watching and i will see you next time you,2025-06-23 14:42:13.609183 UTC
CnD5Uk8qEdQ,New Balance 2002R,zakaboo sneaker reviews welcome to the channel my name is zach you can call me zakaboo and i'm here for you and any sneakers that you might be curious about no brand snobbing no shaming whatsoever i'll be honest with you man before this channel even started i only ever had one pair of new balances in my life and that was actually a hand-me-down pair when i was about nine years old fast forward to today and my respect for the brand is at an all-time high but it's mainly because i really really appreciate quality and consistency matter of fact that's what i got for you guys today this is the new balance 2002 r in the og gray colorway okay let me be even more honest with you guys this particular colorway of the 2002 r might make it look like a slightly less attractive younger brother of the 990 but that's not to say that it's a downgrade in any way or at least for the most part going over the shoe and the first thing that i can say is quality as per usual new balance has given us great craftsmanship with attention to detail and didn't skimp out whatsoever on the materials up top is a mostly suede build that's so damn velvety and soft to the touch paired with mesh underlays for added breathability in other words it's built very similarly to a new balanced 990 which i personally would consider as the flagship or top-of-the-line shoe for the brand difference being the 2002 r won't cost you as much if you get the normal color ways like this instead of the more hyped versions like the protection pack also not that it matters all that much but these just come in your standard gray new balance box and not a made in the us or made in england type of box which leads me to believe that saving on production costs was one of the reasons why this shoe is cheaper than the 990. there is a difference though and that has more so to do with the actual cushion setup of the 2002 r while the price point may be lower than the 990s and i'm talking about the most recent version the v5s and also the v6 that's coming sometime this year new ballots didn't actually skimp out on any cushion or comfort whatsoever jumping right into the cushion and it appears that new balance went with their absorb cushion tech which is foam based and very similar to something like bounce from adidas not too dense not too bouncy but light and great for all-day comfort matter of fact absorb was also used in the 990 v2 as well as a few other top tier models from the brand in addition to that these guys also have new balances energy on the lateral side of the heel which is on the more plush side just to absorb any shock or impact while it may look slightly similar to nike shocks best believe it feels so much better but given that these have a very early 2000s vibe it's understandable why they'd share that design language it is important to note though that just because they're named the 2002 r and look like shoes from the early 2000s doesn't mean these guys are based off a shoe from that time period matter of fact they're actually a modernized take on a shoe from 2010 which was named the nb 2002 if we're going over the fit and support it's pretty straight to the point while these do have a torsional bar with adequate arch support and while they are mentioned to be very wide foot and flat foot friendly i'm going to leave that part to any viewers out there who have personal experience with these on my part though i went with my usual 9.5 so these do fit true to size for me with just a little wiggle room up front but i'm assuming that's mostly for toe splaying while running because yeah while we may use these as casual or lifestyle shoes they were actually meant for running as well or rather based off a shoe that was meant for running would i say that these guys are a top running shoe honestly it would depend on your needs as a runner and i'm not an expert at running or anything like that so i'm just going to skip the whole performance part all together but i will say that these feel great especially if you're just going to be walking all day long which is what i would personally use them for lifestyle and because a lot of people watching this video are most likely going to be wearing these for lifestyle as well let's talk about the colorway real quick i said it once and i'll keep saying it man i really do think new balance does a grey best i'll even go as far as saying across all the different shades of grey but this particular colorway may not be for everyone it's sort of like a dirty darker shade with a sort of brownish undertone which honestly has me thinking it looks a little bit like a wrap the mauve laces don't help either but hey the rest of the shoe does have some very dark somewhat midnight blue hits along with a few reflective hits as well again this colorway might not be the easiest to style but the good news is there are plenty of other colorways out there whether you buy from your local reseller or from the website if you're somewhere else not named the philippines now these are more widely available around the world but if you're a viewer from the philippines then resale might be your best bet but even then at an average resale price of somewhere around 6 000 philippine pesos which is like 120 bucks it'll still cost you a lot less than any version of the 990 but that is of course if you go for the general release colorways and not the more hyped colorways such as the protection pack in the u.s though i think that you can find these ranging between 100 to 140 bucks again depending on the colorway but i was just basing it off the website and a couple of other sources as well would i choose this over the 990 i'd probably still go for most versions of the 990 just because i love that entire line but the 2002 r will definitely be worth your money and that's really all we could ask for comfort quality and a fairly decent price point for what you'll get let me go ahead and set these down real quick because i actually have a comment nay a complaint slight nitpick if you will i really wish that new balance in asia and the philippines in particular would carry more of the 2002 r or other silhouettes just so consumers don't always have to rely on resellers as it is today buying sneakers is already hard enough and you kinda don't know where the resellers are gonna strike at least that's the case over here but then again how they approach the philippine or asian market it's not for me to decide i did get these from a guy named rom over on facebook marketplace he's sort of a well-known reseller for new balance sneakers especially those that are hard to find matter of fact he's actually my go-to for new balance sneakers as well as good souls ph they don't actually know that i'm mentioning them in this video i highly doubt that they know who i am as well but the reason why i'm mentioning them is because i want all the potential consumers out there to at least know that there are a few sources here in the country in my country yes they are resellers but their prices aren't too far up the app and the service is great in my experience now as

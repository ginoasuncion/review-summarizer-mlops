# YouTube Product Aggregator

A Cloud Run service that automatically aggregates multiple YouTube video reviews of the same product into comprehensive, unified summaries. This service is triggered when new individual video summaries are uploaded to the storage bucket.

## 🚀 Features

- **Intelligent Product Grouping**: Automatically identifies and groups videos reviewing the same product
- **Multi-Review Synthesis**: Combines multiple reviews into comprehensive product analysis
- **Brand Recognition**: Recognizes common shoe brands and product models
- **Comparative Analysis**: Provides insights across different reviewers and perspectives
- **Structured Output**: Generates organized summaries with key insights and recommendations
- **Automatic Triggering**: Listens to Cloud Storage events for new summary uploads

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Individual Video Summaries → Product Aggregator → Unified Product Reviews
```

1. **Individual Summaries**: Generated by the transcript summarizer service
2. **Product Aggregator**: Groups videos by product and creates unified summaries
3. **Product Reviews**: Comprehensive analysis combining multiple perspectives

## 📋 What Gets Generated

For each product with multiple reviews, the aggregator creates:

### Product Summary
- **Product Overview**: What the product is and its main features
- **Consensus Analysis**: What most reviewers agree on (pros and cons)
- **Key Strengths**: Most commonly praised aspects
- **Common Concerns**: Frequently mentioned issues or drawbacks
- **Price-Performance**: Value for money assessment
- **Target Audience**: Who would benefit most from the product
- **Comparison Insights**: How it compares to alternatives
- **Overall Recommendation**: General consensus on whether to buy
- **Reviewer Credibility**: Diversity and expertise of reviewers

### Product Metadata
- Product name and identification
- Total number of reviews analyzed
- Total and average view counts
- List of reviewers and video IDs
- Processing timestamps
- Search queries that led to the product

## 🔍 Product Recognition

The service uses intelligent pattern matching to identify products:

### Brand Recognition
- **Nike**: Air Max, Air Force, Jordan, etc.
- **Adidas**: Ultraboost, Samba, Stan Smith, etc.
- **Other Brands**: Puma, Reebok, Converse, Vans, New Balance, etc.

### Title Analysis
- Removes common words: "review", "unboxing", "test", "comparison"
- Extracts brand + model combinations
- Falls back to search query or title keywords

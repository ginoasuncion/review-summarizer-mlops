45kpKPcixfw,smells like leather that's awesome and moth balls No never they were found in the back of a warehouse somewhere there has to be moth ball smell like mold not moth balls hey what's good guys my name is Chris welcome back to the official wear testers.com YouTube channel today we got a detailed look and review on these guys right here are they bad boys not my pair but this is the Air Jordan one on sneakers they're calling them Chicagos even though they've been using the promotion and everything to say lost and found so what is their name but anyways this shoe is one of my favorite shoes of all time like the air Jord one is just awesome the Chicago colorway is my favorite colorway of the shoe I think that these are really really cool kind of like overall I think that the overall presentation and packaging is pretty much fantastic like this is like none some of the best storytelling that they've done even though I don't completely agree with the story that they are telling but you know you got a mismatch lid here because these are supposed to be shoes that they just found in the back room which still happens to this day there's so much shoes especially it happens probably more today than it does back in the day but anyways you go into the back room and you're just like oh I found a random pair of whatever this is yoink so that's what the whole concept of the shoe is I do think that it's awesome because I've been in stores like this like where like there's like the main store and then you go to the back and there's other stuff and it's like a time capsule it's amazing but inside the Box they come double wrapped you've got two types of paper one's the regular plain paper the other one is really really cool it's got a ton of original ads from the80s for the Air Jordan 1 it's really dope though to see like how cheap they got you know what I mean like this was not an easy sell back in the80s shoes didn't look like this this was one of the first ones to truly bring like crazy colors outside of the dunks and things like that to be true to your school stuff so it was one of the first ones to really like be wild like that on top of that it was a signature shoe the guy hadn't even played a game in the NBA wow they signed him to a signature deal gave him a signature shoe before he even played in the leag everybody was like why am I going to buy this guy's shoe so it wasn't an easy sale they had to really play up on these mom and pop shops and really sell the shoes to them which is the part of the story that I dislike sorry what was that turn the phones off lady I know I'm sorry I was going to chime in with something but I wanted to verify was it a in life meme no it's about how you're saying how hard a sell this shoe is and I follow a lot of mommy bloggers and this one her daughter just had her I don't know if it's a bar mitzvah or a bat mitzvah anyways she posted pictures from the party and every single kid in these photos was what year was this like last weekend oh okay I thought was you're going to be like it was from the ' 80s no but every kid in this at this party is wearing Jordan ones to match whatever fancy outfit and I'm like there wasn't a single van not a single Converse they were just all Jordan Ones yeah that's cuz of Our Generation we made this Beast oops sorry something that I find very interesting though again like I was saying the story of the whole thing is like they come with this fake receipt and stuff the Sandy Bros it's not a real shop but it's really cool there's tons of Easter eggs in this thing by the way so if you can list them all do it I'm only going to give you one that guy right there is wearing a pair of airships that's sick I do like that the receipt it reminds me of like growing up and oh dude like the way that you used to like do a credit card with the like I said the packaging presentation everything amazing they'd never done it better than this it just sucks that the story that they're telling talking about Mom and Pop shops and stuff like this is the same brand that has killed many M and pop shops because they're trying to go direct to Consumer whereas back in the'80s they had to really sell this product to a mom and pop shop and be like no trust me this is going to sell like this is going to be a hot item this is going to be this this is our best thing whatever I was just in one of those meetings I've never been in a buyer meeting before where a brand is pitching to retailers like why you want to carry their product it was one of the most fascinating things I've ever been in you know what I mean I had no like say in anything cuz it wasn't my deal or whatever but like I was just kind of like a fly on the wall I was in the back of the room it was super interesting and that's what Nike had to do back then they had to be be like no trust us you're going to want to carry this product people are going to want it from this guy and so without these mom and pop shops taking a chance on this brand and on this model right here Nike wouldn't be where it is today you know what I mean like it's just it is a fact and then they've pulled their accounts from multiple mom and pop shops some of them The Originals that they used to sell to it's up that this is like what they're celebrating when they've literally killed fam's businesses Once Upon a Time Nike was like Scrub Daddy is that what this spch is called on Shark Tank oh yeah yeah yes that's that's exactly what it's like like it was such an interesting thing to be part of like in that buyer meeting I'm not going to say what brand it is it was a smaller brand because that's not how Nike operates now I've been part of those meetings as well again fly in the room like just in the back and Nike and Jordan tell you what you're going to get they don't even let you pick it half the damn time it's wild and then they give you all the other crap that doesn't sell just to carry this one they're like oh if you want to carry this you've got to buy all of these from us and it's just the way that the power structure has worked is completely flipped on itself that's the part that I don't really like this is the part that I don't hear anybody talking about which is unfortunate but I mean most people are new let's be real and these shoes are amazing oh the shoes the shoes themselves are gorgeous like look at this this left this left pair is so good this right one is leaning so hard like this toe box is so crooked can you see it it's perfect it's literally been like giving me some kind of Elvis look bro I get these in cuz there's two problems here there's a manufacturing issue right so that's a Jordan brand problem but then there's also this whole like goat verified checklist quality control is a whole section like you're telling me that this passed really and I'm not a fan of resellers but I'm going to be on your side for this time because I know damn well if you had this shoe and you're trying to sell it on that platform they're going to take it in and they're going to reject it from you they're not going to let you sell it because it looked like and if you do they're going to be like no you got to note that there are defects but if it's goat selling it directly to you cuz I bought the instant ship pair prever verified which means that it's part of their stock they don't give a their rules don't apply to them I think that's up there was somebody who commented on I think yesterday's video the Jordan 2os and he was saying that he tried to sell something on Goat I can't remember what Jordan it was but because it looked like there was Heavy creasing in the toe that's not even a defect that's just leather and but he he was adamant that he had never warn them oh no that's the thing though I've seen that stockx does it too these companies are shady as so yeah there's all kinds of that problems in the world obviously these are first world problems like there's much worse things going on all across the globe right now but we're here to talk about shoes so that's exactly what I'm doing now as far as the shoe itself is concerned Everybody Knows by now what this is this is an Air Jordan one it's part of the new batch or the new shape we saw this previously with those uh Gorge greens it's supposed to be kind of in that same line and everything so we've got slightly different different outsole this one is vintaged which I think is funny because when they tried this the first time man it was almost a decade ago and it was with the first retro release of the AJ K's the canvas ones people fing hated it hated it and now everybody's like yeah it's prev vintage this is awesome I'm like wow this is so weird the soul is slightly yellow that's not too bad so this I can deal with you know what I mean when it's like weirdly piss yellow like the vibe remake lab shoe which bar none is still one of the best Jordans I've ever like just seen and a guy like crafts the shoe by hand with love and care but the SS is gross I don't like that I don't mind when they do that on their own I just don't want to buy it like that and then the materials themselves like I was saying earlier man these smell like leather they don't smell like glue it smells like quality so there's not a lot of bad things here it's just this is one of those be careful pick your pairs you know what I mean like if you're able to look at them in store just do it obviously I got these online I can't do that like you get what you get now the tech specs are just as you guys know they feature the greatest traction of all time in inside the rubber cupsole is a polyurethane wedge inside of the polyurethane wedge is a heel air unit one thing that I was a little disappointed by besides the right shoe is that uh the insole is the black polyurethane I thought it was going to be a white one cuz it's like an OG OG you know what I mean but I guess they're going to save that for the 85 cut version whenever they release that next awesome wow a lot of people don't like the crack leather I am one of those people the white portions don't bother me as much cuz I can't really see it like it's very very fine uh this one is a little bit more distressed than the other one one uh this is going to be one of those things where it's just kind of I don't want to call it inconsistent just because they're cracks like they are inconsistent by Nature you know what I mean like they're not going to be able to do that like perfectly every time I don't really like the back part though that just looks weird it looks dirty or unfinished it's supposed to be a nod to when you do find them in the back they're not perfect I thought the originals was like a painted sponge uh some of them are some of them are not there's so many different factories that they manufactured the original Air Jordan 1 in that like they're all a little different so if you see or hear or talk to an OG OG like somebody that was like a teen to an adult back then they'll straight up specify what Factory do you have and like you'll have to like know what it is and they are marked in there and all that stuff they still are now they're on the size labels but yeah it's just one of those weird things where they were all made a little bit differently that's why when they did the whole 85 cut I was like these kind of look more like a 94 and not like an 85 like it looks like more like a mix you know what I mean like almost like a hybrid so yeah that's why I think the vibe remake lab shoe is so interesting cuz that guy was meticulous about making the every panel the shape the back structure everything like all of it was on point something that I love though is just when you pull them out of the box this is what they look like and I found some original pictures from I'm going to try to Source the right person cuz online everybody steals pictures so I don't know exactly where everything originates from I did my best to try to like Source it it'll be on there but this is how they looked you pulled them out of the box they came with two sets of laces they were pre-placed in there and stuff and I think it's really really dope but anyways these guys have the slightly bigger swoosh they also have the 85 style wings logo on there so if you were to match this up with a regular air Jord one highog and the 85 version the highog has the Pressed what the is that called OSS deboss I don't remember I'm sorry you guys teach me every time and somehow it just keeps going right through but anyways this one's more like the 85 cut where it kind of comes off the shoe and everything like that which I think is dope the tongue is awesome it's nylon it's got the yellow like it looks yellow but it's actually just a padding underneath so I think that that's really really cool the overall shape it's not perfect it's not quite like an 85 but it's better than they have been so I like this a lot you can tell that they're fine-tuning things as they go along which I appreciate I just don't appreciate that one like that one's just a lot of people are like oh the SS are uneven but when you put your weight on it it flattens out that's true I have tons of ones a lot of them are like this and when I wear them they do flatten out but the toe is also crooked and it makes me feel like it's forcing my foot to have a bunion and that doesn't feel good it's not comfortable it's not what I paid for this thing looked like The Simpsons character's eyes where one's like straight and the other one's that way nah don't look at me but you're everywhere it's not cool overall though I think that the concept the packaging obviously the color the shoe itself just legendary like there's nothing else to say other than there's a craftsmanship or quality flaw there I hope that a lot of pairs are not like this these are going to be like super mass-produced so check your pairs man like there's going to be more like this than not it just is what it is now as far as their size is concerned they do fit true to size whatever you typically wear in your air Jord 1es that's exactly what I would recommend here I again think that these are great at least this left one this right one needs some work though man but with all that being said thank you so much for watching thanks for all your support we greatly appreciate it and with that being said we'll catch you on the next one so until next time have a good one,2025-06-19 08:40:13.608130 UTC
kRkR0VUwaOA,in today's video we're going to be reviewing the reebok club c85 vintage to help you decide if it deserves a spot in your closet or wherever you keep your shoes on the shelf or on the floor let's go hey what's going on my name is chris ross another channel i like to make content around men's shoes clothes and grooming products as a whole so if that's something you're interested in go ahead and hit that subscribe button i've been wearing this shoe for a few weeks now and i've got some things to tell you let's start off with something that's important to everyone the sizing and the fit now when i first put these on they didn't quite feel like they fit that is they were snug on the sides especially in the toe box area but i got mine in na9 and that's because everywhere i looked it said that if it's true the size which for the most part is true they do fit true to size but it's almost like an exact fit it is a very narrow shoe so for all you wide-footed people out there you might want to take that into consideration whenever you are going to buy this shoe the best way i've seen it described is they fit a lot like vans it's a really narrow shoe and the toe box is kind of pointed so it squeezes your toes a little bit now i personally prefer a little bit of wiggle room in my shoes and i do wish i would have went a half size up just to give me that little bit extra room but i'm actually fine with just the nine for now if you do like that extra space then go ahead and go a half size up on a side note these look like orthopedic shoes i'm not i can't stop seeing it whenever i look at it i see orthopedics even though i did say that these run narrow in the toe box that's not to say that these are not comfortable so we went grocery shopping the other day not like oh just pick up a few things grocery shopping but like grocery shopping to where you don't want to go back to the grocery store for at least three or four months because of how bad of an experience it was grocery shopping but we did spend a solid two hours walking around the grocery store and i could say that i probably could have done another two hours walking around in these shoes these things are super comfortable the shoe sits fairly low below the ankle so there isn't a bunch of rubbing and stuff like that on your ankle or your achilles that's always a plus in my book the break-in time is virtually zero and that's mainly because of the leather and i'll let you know why in just a bit the insole is about a quarter inch thick and it features an eva a sponge and french terry cloth now if you don't know what eva is it's pretty much this like firm foam material that's that they feature in a lot of insoles and midsoles for shoes since we're on the subject of the insole it has the reebok brand on there but it's like faded and kind of worn when you get them to kind of play on the vintage sink which i really thought was a really cool detail there are also patches of foam on the inside where your arch and the opposite side of your arch sit so there's a little bit of extra cushion there as well and it does help a lot and reebok actually took it a step further to give you terry cloth around your ankle so it's really soft around your ankle and there's a lot of cushioning and pad in between that we actually look at the sole right here so this is this rubber it's a really nice rubber it's pretty soft actually too and you can see right here is this exposed eva this is that eva i was talking about before it's firm but soft that's the best way i can explain it and if you slap all that together the insole this midsole and then your rubber outsole you get a pretty comfortable shoe the tongue even has a little bit of tear cloth on it and it's got a thick foam in there wrapped in nylon maybe they thought this was just gonna be like you know what maybe we'll just make this an orthopedic shoe for real i i'm sorry i can't shake it yes the reebok close c85s do come in at 80 that's correct that's what lily wanted you to know so in comparison to shoes that you may be looking at like the air force ones the new balances or even a pair of vans these and 80 dollars sit right in the middle you end up getting a pair of shoes that'll probably last you over the years and i say that because of things like for instance the soles are stitched and glued on the cream colorway usually ages really well because when they do get dirty they're off white so they don't get that dingy look to them because they kind of already are and not only that these vintage base shoes just like chuck taylors and even nike blazers they have that old look to them so as they wear it kind of just goes with the theme of the shoe i mentioned leather earlier and the leather used here is actually a chrome tan leather which isn't anything special because they're used on other shoes all the time but what you need to know about it is that the leather on these is actually really really soft especially compared to those other shoes that i mentioned before i don't know what they did or how they did it to get the leather this soft straight from the factory but it doesn't have that plasticky feel that chrome tan leather usually has and since this is an all leather upper that's what gives you that kind of zero week break in time which i was talking about earlier cool so if you get a pair definitely just take a second to rub the leather and compare them to another pair of shoes that you have that are in the same price range and you'll feel the difference now if you don't want to spend the full 80 and you want to feel like you got a deal then if you shop around a little bit you can probably find these for five to ten dollars off dsw had them for i think 75 packs on at 75 and maybe some other places will have them in that 70 range but you're just gonna have to catch it but outside of that i don't think the price is gonna vary that much and that is depending on the colorway which reminds me there are a few things that you definitely need to know before you buy these some things you need to know if you're looking for a casual shoe to change it up from the regular chuck taylor vans air force ones common projects boom here you go this has pretty much effectively shelves my air force ones for the foreseeable future honestly i'm really not sure why these aren't more popular than they are right now because everyone is already dressing like vintagey and all that other stuff especially if you like that 80s early 90s kind of look these go great with i've been watching these doing a little bit of market research and the search for these has hit an all-time high within the last month so i wouldn't be surprised if these just became wildly popular out of nowhere this is a very light shoe sometimes that's a concern for people so just so you know also this sole although it looks thick it really isn't that thick so you're only going to get about an inch of height with these if that is something that you're concerned about if you want this off-white colorway technically the colorway is chalk paper white you have to get the vintage there are actually three different variations of the club c85 there's the regular ones there's the vintage and then there's the tvs the tvs are actually the most expensive they retail for 90 and i think the regular ones are 10 cheaper than this the vintage and the tvs are very similar uh there are a few differences i think the leather is a little bit different the material on the insole is a little bit different there may be one or two other things to it between these and the regulars one of the biggest differences is the profile of the shoe these are a lot flatter and the top is a lot thinner and more narrow as to where the regular 85 c's have a more rounded toe box and the side profile is a lot more rounded as well now go ahead and click up in the corner if you want to know how to style these too and if it's not up immediately after then just go ahead and subscribe hit that notification button so then you can know as soon as it comes up and then you'll be ready to be like i'm out here i'm ready and as always guys i will see you in the next one,2025-06-19 08:38:04.998048 UTC
RTnyX4YICI8,what is going on gang Eli here today we're going to be talking about the Reebok Club c85 vintage specifically my pair now I love my pair um you wouldn't be able to tell by looking at them but I do love my pair and I've had them for about 4 years and in that four years they've probably seen about two years worth of abuse maybe more but I wanted to talk about how well they've held up over the years we're going to talk about how well the upper held up how well the lower has held up how the Comfort has held up throughout the years and lastly we're actually going to clean them cuz Lord knows they need it and I also think that's going to give us a really good idea of how well they've really aged so let's jump right into it first up the upper now obviously I think the upper is actually held up pretty well it's obviously creased a ton ton but that's really to be expected especially with how soft the leather is I haven't really been able to see any major leather peeling they might actually be too dirty for me to tell but I haven't seen any major signs of leather peeling or any leather tears so that's really good what I have seen is a little bit of separation of the upper and the out sole but thankfully these are actually constructed really well they have a stitched upper to lowerer construction so there's not going to be any major separation thankfully it's most likely just the glue that's separated a bit but the upper has not fully separated the lining on the shoe has also held up really well it's that terry cloth lining that I love and it hasn't ripped or anything it's held up really nicely it's it's dirty obviously but it's held up really well and then the out soole now the outsole is pretty much the same story it's got a little bit of that heel wear and also some somewhere where the ball of your foot is it's obviously dirty as Sin but like I said overall nothing major on the outsole it's still very much intact now let's talk about the Comfort how it's held up this is probably I don't want to say it's my most comfortable shoe classic shoe wise this is probably one of the more comfortable shoes out there that EVA foam rains Superior it's very comfortable on feet and then with the soft leather on the toes makes it a fantastically comfortable shoe that you can wear all day I don't think it's as comfortable as it was when I first bought it obviously the wear and just the age of the shoe is going to make it not as comfortable as it used to be the foam feels a little more worn than it was when I first got them but overall still a very comfortable shoe the Comfort has definitely held up so that's enough talking let's go baptize these shoes to see if we can't redeem it of its sins so enjoy the Montage let's get it feel you Ain welcome back gang it's been a couple days and the shoes are finally clean and they're finally dry and they look good now that they're fully clean I can finally see if we have any scuffs on the leather and I definitely found some there were some scuffs on the toe area nothing too crazy just a couple little kind of scratches and little dings as well as a couple oh my gosh as well as a couple scuff marks on like the side and on the rear area as well like I mentioned before overall nothing major I also you know I wasn't wearing these hiking or anything or maybe I did obviously we still got some crazy creasing that's not really going to go away but I think overall they've aged relatively nicely I mean look look at that they look so clean and so yeah very happy with the way they cleaned up they cleaned up super well uh I probably could have scrubbed a little bit better on the back but yeah definitely a shoe that's definitely going to last you let me know what you guys think and I hope you guys learned something from this video like And subscribe guys and as always see you guys in the next one,2025-06-19 08:38:05.444674 UTC
gI6phQHrSwk,speed is pretty good so i just drove into this empty parking lot which is a church and there was a car doing like donuts over there i didn't think anything of it and i passed them and then they stopped and now they just very slowly pulled behind my car the reebok club c85s in cream not white people say i like your nice white shoes and i'm like try again you buffoon these are cream so hi real quick if you follow me you probably know that i'm usually into like stuff that lasts forever boots and jackets and all that stuff but that's not all there is to me baby so i have two rules well maybe just one a rule that i try to live by to not get set in my ways and get boring or whatever it may be is if you have a disposable product that there's a lot of different versions of you should uh even if you like the version unless you're obsessed with it you should always try something new so the reebok club c85s are my second white shoe ever after my adidas stan smiths which i trashed those i wore those for seven years there were holes on the bottom so i didn't get new white shoes i just stopped wearing them when it was raining outside i'll do a stan smith's video separately so definitely subscribe and follow me on instagram and comment on this video and like it anyways though i want to split this review up into three parts one of them them's gonna be with this guy there's times where i wish i knew more about how to attack someone i think if i turn this way in the video i may be going gray today i'm changing my style so that's what this guy is for i tell people if i'm ever in a fight i'm just gonna try and go the nuts route like if i'm inside and there's a light bulb next to me i'm just gonna grab the light bulb and crush it and be like oh really but i'm not near any light bulbs so i really have no other plan in this specific style this modern style i love and for some reason i just never did it it could be because i was actually permanently banned from r male fashion advice on reddit i'll make a video about that separately because i want to wage war i've never done anything wrong in my life but anyways today i am redoing my entire fashion sense or i guess i'm just getting one outfit that isn't raw denim pants and a raw denim jacket and blunt stones anyways though redoing my style talking about the shoe obviously and then there's one main thing i really don't like i might not like it i don't know we'll talk about that last anyways here we go what are they doing what are you oh okay the reebok club c85s every brand has a white shoe because a white shoe is it adds contrast to basically any pair of pants you have besides white pants but if you're wearing white pants you're probably making a statement anyways that's why i had to redirect from the path and get the cream shoe the more refined subtle hint of i'm not like everybody else i like cream i like cream and my tea looking at the shoe itself obviously i haven't had these for years so i read a lot of reviews and heard what people thought basically the view on reebok is that they're an awesome company that makes high quality shoes for a good price in terms of materials nothing here is crazy you have a sneaker that i think costs 70 bucks with no discounts or anything and it's discounted a lot you have a rubber outsole it is stitched on to the upper probably also glued one thing i do always look for on sneakers is stitching just because if you look at converts that aren't stitched for example when you walk that corner kind of where your toe is it always pops off because the glue wears out or whatever adhesion they use wears out and i just hate that look so in terms of leather quality these are chrome tanned which rose anvil who cut shoes in half all the time any time he sees chrome tanned he seems to hate it but from tan is just a cheaper faster way of tanning leather technically it is not as environmentally friendly as vegetable tanning but it's kind of the world we live in if these were vegetable tanned they would probably cost double this or maybe more the way that you can tell though is that there's a raw self edge of leather basically everywhere where the stitches are which is honestly totally fine it would be weird if the leather was stitched down or rolled or anything like that it'd probably be a weird looking design but you can see that there's a very slight blue hint to it which signifies chrome tan usually unless vegetable tan was getting crazy and some dye fell in there if i had to guess we're totally fine because one it is 2 p.m in the afternoon on a sunday and we're at church so if anything if they were going to come attack me i'm pretty sure god would come down and slice the end goal is to transform myself into someone that you see and you say holy crap that guy looks so relaxed and basically the look that i'm after that a lot of my friends do a lot of people online do is just sweat an oversized kind of cool sweatshirt and then white shoes the goal i'm getting an oversized cape cod sweatshirt today the annoying part about all this is that i can't stand flimsy sweatshirts they drive me nuts i like very thick sweatshirts anything under 12 ounces i'm like get this off of my body they're not my favorite representation of where i'm from but the black dog is the company that i found that makes the heaviest sweatshirts i put my fingers between the sweatshirts and i rub them together and i'm like that feels like a six ounce garment wash like most white sneakers this isn't crazy incredibly high quality leather or anything like that so there is a surface of paint or shine i forget what it's called i'll put it right here plastic there is a surface of that over the leather which gives it that cream or white look and as that scuffs you'll probably start to see the kind of gross color of worn cheap leather like this which again should be expected and in terms of shoes like common projects or something like that 400 white sneakers i've never seen the value in those those age better of course you would hope that they would and now if we look at the side of the shoes you'll see that they're stitching everywhere but this doesn't look like it's different pieces of leather all stitched together at different areas obviously there are different areas of leather but there's also some stitching i think is just used for decoration to give it its look and it looks quite nice there is one part that's not leather i don't know why they did that maybe to give it a different look but if you look right under the ankle there's a little bit of fabric that is rolled so i don't know why they did that maybe they were just like hey you know would be fun i don't think it's to save on cost or anything though i think they were just the designers were getting funky with it the tongue of it looks interesting in the fact that it is more cream than the actual shoe i would say the shoe is like a orthopedic gray i don't know why we'll get into that in a little bit but i would say it's an orthopedic gray but the tongue is truly cream i don't know why that is i hope you can see it on the video but basically you know the trend that's happening right now is that all these companies are kind of reverting back to the 70s 80s 90s people like oversized sweatshirts and different looks and this generation really grabs any generation of style they want but the club c85 is kind of a classic shoe anyway so they never really had to change it but the design on it isn't updated and that's a big plus when we look at the inside of the shoe it's very nice i can see my toe prints i doubt yours will have those but it looks nice it is kind of also raw on the inside things are just stitched they're not folded over doesn't look like they emphasize being super clean which again to me isn't a big deal and then you won't believe it but i found something better than the black dog again black dog makes great stuff but it's just i don't like that aesthetic it's very it's very much the kids that would pick on you in high school wore the black dog anyways though score of a lifetime it turns out this store called soft as a grape has um which my mom actually suggested i go to they have champion hoodies reverse weave which is champion's best sweat material and they have it with cape cod on it breaking news i don't know if i'm going to be able to make it to the field in time because the sun sets at like 1am in the winter the inside is french terry cloth which is ooh i don't know the specific reason to do that french terry cloth aka towel maybe it helps sweat obviously with new sneaker technology it really doesn't matter maybe when these first came out that helped a lot with sweat a picture of towel that you dry yourself off with in those little loops that come out of the towel drink those by like two times i actually didn't even notice that's what it was until i read it online and then i was like oh look at that it is fred's terry cloth did a little run trial of them i can run basically the same speed as i could my stan smith they don't make me go any faster jump height about the same depends on how much i ate that day i noticed is more of a factor than the shoes i found a different field that i will use instead because i'm getting scared it's going to be too dark and also this is probably very bright for the amount of times i've changed in a car you think they'd be for cool reasons or like fun like young youthful reasons they're actually mostly all for videos what is with people driving by me slowly and staring at me oh this feels great bear with me i know you can't see the outfit we're actually gonna do it in two steps one i'm gonna keep the jeans on to the out i say outfit like it's really special the big news is i bought a cape cod sweater thrilled about it but two steps so here we go two things the more i look at this outfit the more i realize it's it's very simple it's just light wash jeans and a gray crew neck with white shoes but i like it and i feel much more stylish than i have been in a while so you need any fashion tips give me a call this is basically just something that people in the 90s wore okay now the the ultimate thing end goal that i wanted which is really simple but it's a big deal for a few reasons the thing that i don't like which again i don't know if i don't like it or not i hinted at it i gave you a little teaser before i have this issue where i need to realize that i basically you essentially have two pairs of shoes you have the pair of shoes when you put them on and you look down and you say that's what my shoes look like and then you have the pair of shoes where everybody else sees them from the side angle and they say oh that's what your shoes look like i think from the side these shoes look great young hip when i look down though i see these these like orthopedic old shoes and i just can't get over that especially because like i said before the color of the shoes is an orthopedic gray and my worst fear is someone runs up right next to me and they go like shoulder to shoulder and they look directly down at my shoes and like are you wearing grandpa's shoes my hair is greying but these are young man shoes and honestly maybe it's just a change in style because as i wore them and walked around with them to film i was kind of like oh these are cool these are cool any way you look at them and i'm sure as they break in and loosen a little bit they're gonna look cooler and cooler would i get these over stan smith's again no because i will probably never get either of those shoes again unless it's for a youtube video because there's plenty other white shoes for me to try it's very simple it's actually painfully simple it's just sweatpants but for some reason i have this mental block about sweatpants where if i put them on i feel like people will think i'm lazy or gross or something but it's very much accepted now that wearing sweatpants as long as you look like you put some tiny bit of effort into your outfit it's pretty much accepted that sweatpants are a fashion statement now i had the toughest time doing that i wore sweats yesterday all day like the first time just as an outfit and what happened was there is this moment where i spilled crumbs of something on my sweatpants and i was just like oh i just look so sloppy and i look like i didn't try today but it's not true i did try i even i was sat on my bed and i was like oh i don't know maybe i'll put on my jeep maybe i'll put on a full suit instead i want to vary up all my looks i want to be well versed so now i'm in a full sweatsuit and i'm feeling good i feel like i'm in my pajamas but also at the same time i feel like a fashionista people that are watching this video are probably like this put on sweatpants and expects me to clap for him wait wait as always i always forget to review this part size i always forget to talk about size i went true to size with these eight and a half i could do a nine i could also do an eight a nine would be a little too big eight would be a little too small so i guess i can't do that eight and a half i typically wear an eight and a half i think my stan smiths are an eight i will put it right here look look at this number that's what my stan smiths are i don't know why i always forget the most important part of the video and i also don't tie them and they fit well they don't fall off when i went this size eight and a half anyways though that's about it grandpa has to go take his vitamins now so his gray hairs don't get any longer i can't lie the level of comfort i feel even versus like my broken in washed jeans it's pretty ridiculous all right i feel very trendy right now and i like it feels really good me,2025-06-19 08:38:05.552649 UTC

kmHMVy_2_vM,my dreams come true starting off with the construction of the shoe the ebo clopsies are a quote inspired sneaker with a classic tennis shoe silhouette embracing its 80s Heritage rebok clsy retains its retro design language with a panel leather upper and a slim midsole the upper is made of the splash genuine leather with seams of stitching across the shoes multiple panels across the T box are three rows of perforations for increased ventilation the model I have here in hand is the REO Club c85 vintage editions and this work version comes with a high quality leather upper and a unique chalk colorway the club C also includes a detached tongue made of soft foam and a terry cloth lining around the ankle collar the sock liner made of thick foam is glued to the foot bed they can be detached with minimal effort if one needs to lastly the outsole is made of high abration resistant rubber with glide Groves throughout the length of the shoe coming to the upper the ebok club c85 in this vintage Edition is made of this soft and pliable leather which is hands down one of the plushest leather uppers have come across in a sneaker in this price bracket the leather feels high quality and luxurious which for a change is so refreshing to see in a shoe at a non-luxury price What drew me initially to the rebok club seies was a classic retro shoe wipe that it gave off with its off-white chalk colorway and the layer construction of the upper it's not ostentatious in its appearance and it has just about enough going on to help it stand apart from other white shoes with a rather simpler appearance I love the chalk colorway on these vintage versions which gives the shoe an appearance of refinement that you often find in luxury products this particular color also helps keeps things understated and they don't create the same sort of contrast a pure white shoe does when match with a pair of dark jeans or trousers I've own the Rebo Club Seas for over a year now and even today I enjoy the feeling of the soft and supple leather over my feet every time I put on the shoe debok does not specify the type of leather used on the shoe and the website refers to it as a soft garment leather in my opinion it most likely is some form of chrome tan G leather but I may be wrong for the Rebo Club c85 I went through to size and they fit perfectly across the length and breadth of my foot even with its round and taper toebox shape the shoe feels quite roomy for my moderately wide feet and I felt no pressure points whatsoever the soft impliable leather upper feels FL and comfortable giving my feet a sensation of being wrapped inside an old and cozy leather jacket I love the feeling of wling my toes and watching the leather upper mold accordingly it's a feeling that unfortunately is rarely found in leather fall of the shoes at this price range the club seies also have a traditional detached tongue made of soft foam the tongue feels light and unobstrusive but it does tend to move out of place when you are walking with a regular evm M Soul the expectation isn't one of high levels of cushioning to my surprise the midsole performs remarkably well in providing adequate levels of comfort even after hours of use the midsole isn't soft and Squishy like the max squishing forms but it's not uncomfortable either the EV foam isn't firm and stiff and it has enough softness to give you above average comfort even after hours of wear the shoe bear is quite flat and the lack of art support can be an isue for flat foots this issue can be partially solved by using custom insults and i' suggest you try these with custom insults if you require our support a year later it's fair to say that the shoe has held up well which also includes 6 months of extensive use as daily work shoes the construction and quality of the upper has surpassed my expectations and I'm yet to see glaring signs of cracks or creases that one often finds in lowquality leather uppers as you can see the upper is quite pliable and does not suffer from any major signs of cracks or creases around points of stress the creases that have developed are minor enough to not appear glaring and add character to the Fine age appearance it has developed over time the club Seas also pass a tolex test with flying colors as highlighted earlier I daily the club sees as my work Paar shoes and this use case often involves extended durations of toe bends while am on my seat while this can be the downfall of many leather shoes the club Seas remain unfl fluttered with this kind of stress test with the club sees on my feet I no longer care about the way my feet are planted on the floor that's not to say that the shoes are in Min condition like they were when they first arrived over time there are signs of wear and air which you will see in a bit on the lateral side there are some permanent stains which I believe are down to some unwanted rubbing against an abrasive surface on the InStep of my left shoe there is also a minor discoloration near the last eyelid there are marks that may have been caused by my shoe accidentally brushing off against the wall or a concrete the construction of the shoe is quite solid and it is quite evident in the way the sole looks after one year of extensive use the outsole 2 is in great condition with minimal wear on the outsole tread on number of occasions I have accidentally bumped the front of the shoe either against sidewalk or a race platform despite these stress test there are no visible signs of damage or dents on the exterior of the Mido overall the club Club se's are a durable shoe and I can't recommend them enough the club se's fortunately don't have many cons to start with nevertheless there are certain limitations to the rebok clsy which are down to the category of the shoes they belong to as expected they cannot replicate the comfort of Max cushion shoes and there are certainly better alternatives for people who are on their feed the whole day in spite of these limitations the club sees do punch about their weight and I have used these extensively at events and long AO days without any sort of discomfort in fact the Eva midso provides above average cushioning for this class and I experien no sort of heel pain or ankle discomfort Club se's do have one short coming which is noteworthy in my opinion with the multi-panel construction the leather panels overlap one another leaving exposed edges at the point of seeing with extended use these exposed edges tend to darken and create a sort of distraction that make the shoe appear dirtier than it is unlike the leather upper the raw EXP post edges are harder to clean and as a result the shoe will never look as fresh as they did out of the box unfortunately this also means that the club Seas cannot be used for occasions that need a reste outfit and a spotless pair of shoes in conclusion the EB Club se's rank amongst my best purchases so far and they have been a staple of my wardrobe since day one they look great especially in the chalk colorway and the multipanel Stitch uper gives the shoe a distinct character and depth that you won't find in other shoes I don't see them being replaced anytime soon and they would always remain my go-to pair of shoes for more circumstances so if you're in the market for a casual white sneaker look no further than the rebor club c85 vintage editions you won't be disappointed you're watching fast forward and I'll be back with my next long-term review,2025-06-19 08:38:07.456426 UTC
Qn5PsauO9-A,welcome back everyone to another episode of sh TV my name is morissa Hill and today we're going to be taking a look at a rebok club c85 vintage let's take a quick seat feat welcome back everyone to another unboxing and review if you're joining us for the first time welcome in be sure to hit that subscribe down below and give this video a thumbs up if you enjoy these unboxing and styling segments today we're going to be discussing the rebok club c85 vintage which is pretty much one of the most popular sinkers I've been seeing on foot here in New York currently so we'll go through the overview of these jump into size and fit and then we'll talk about how I style this really vintage looking sneaker then we'll conclude with how much these are priced on the retail Market so let's jump right into it if you are looking to just start your sneer collection you don't know where to start what brand to go with I feel like right now price point wise look and feel this is a great starter sneaker that you can really just pair and wear with anything and everything and what's crazy is the sneaker was created back in 1985 and it is still a hot and trendy looking shoe uh so as far as the color scheme goes on this it is all aged in the color and tones throughout so we've just got this off-white finish and the leather is premium and tumbled and soft and nice and Squishy which I really love about uh as far as the material goes for the upper of this it really feels good on the toes one of the things that does frustrate me a bit though with the reok club SE 85s is I just wish there was a little more width on the toe box cuz I feel like my pinky toes tend to rub for some reason on these and it doesn't get broken in to the point where that rubbing doesn't make my foot feel uncomfortable but other than that I do love how malleable and soft this leather is on the toe as far as laces go we've got some off-white laces a peachy tone for the mesh tongue which is outlined in cream and then we've got re box branding in green and red let's take a look at those details then move along to the side paneling all right so wrapping around to the side paneling we've got that same just lovely textured leather in that off-white tone and then we've got Reebok in green on the back and then the same color combination on the lateral side except we have the Reebok branding in green as well the interior has rebok in it and then it's fully covered in this beautiful just nice terry cloth Chenille uh finish which is very soft feels nice and gentle like a towel and then Reebok has kind of had that worn look as you can see on the insole but the insole also is that same texture as you see on the collar so super soft inside and then when we work our way down to the midsole it is in this nice beige finish which gives it this kind of worn effect which I really love I think it brings the sneaker together and then you've got the rebok there which blends monochromatically quite nicely and then the out soole is in that same exact color way all right let's take a look at those last and final details [Applause] he as far as size and fit goes I stuck true size and these do fit me perfectly although again I do have that subtle issue which just the toe box being a bit on the narrow side I do have narrow feet so if you actually have flatter wider feet I would actually recommend sizing up to just give you a little bit of extra space in the toe box region all right so now let's talk about styling this again this is just such a great vintage looking sneaker this is going to go with pretty much everything and anything and would be a great beater shoe just because it already kind of has this worn look I literally was in the mall when I picked these up and I feel like so many people were trying these on and buying them so I kid you not this is hands down one of the most sought after Seekers right now that I feel like a lot of people are buying uh as far as styling goes I decided to just keep it simple for the first look with a white tank and a denim mini skirt then for the second look I went with a nice simple yellow T-shirt with some great biker shorts for a more casual at leisure look and then for the last and final look dressed up a little bit with a vest that had a nice light brown tone and it was outlined in black with a matching maxi skirt so this is a great sneaker that you can definitely dress up you can dress down uh this is definitely just going to be a great allaround lifestyle sneaker God please protect me I'm halfway home take the wheel right now I Let Go thinking about the ones I let go I thought by now you forgive me no it's not easy forgiving founding new reason for living n says making noise all all the the hand I was got to let it shuh huh tell me where the sign I'll give it all away for some pce of mind cuz life f is all as far as price point goes you can't beat it this is retailed at $90 which is probably a huge reason that a lot of people are going after these just because not only is the quality really nice it's also easy to sell sneaker but the price point is under $100 all right everyone that is it for this unboxing and review if you joined us for the first time thank you so much be sure to hit that subscribe on your way out if you're not already subscribed to the channel give this

YxxKwCe5lkY,hey what's going on youtube today we're going to be looking at three different versions of the club c85 we got the regular club c85 we have the club c85 vintage and then we have the club c85 tv we're going to be looking at some of the differences and then i'm going to be giving my opinion on which ones i think you should buy and the reason i'm doing this video because i feel like there's a lot of confusion surrounding like um which shoes what's the difference between all three models especially these two there seems to be a lot of confusion as to what the difference is between the vintage and the tv is because they look so similar so before we actually take a look at the differences i want to look at the boxes so the box for the regular club sees it's just your typical reebok classic box it's got the navy with the red just your typical box nothing really special about it um and then for the vintage we have the union jack because it's part of the vintage line so we got the union jack on the box and then for the tvs it's the same box actually as the vintages for me they came with the sleeve um i bought them on end clothing because unfortunately they didn't have the tvs in my size on reebok.com and they sent it to me with the sleeve i'm not sure if it comes with the sleeve directly from reebok or and clothing actually put it on themselves so you know do what you will with that info all right now let's talk about the price differences because they actually all have different price ranges regular eclipses retail at 70 the vintages retail at 75 and then the tvs retail at 90. so obviously there's going to be some differences between them all right moving on to the color of these shoes the differences anyways for the regular klepsies they come in quite a few different colorways um you have obviously this one's the white with the navy and then there's also a white with the green accents and then there's an all black one so there's a couple of different color options for the regular club c's now for the vintages they pretty much only come in the chalk paper white with the green for the men's they do have some special editions of these shoes but they're obviously they're not readily available to everyone and you can only really get them on their party sites like stockx the women are a bit luckier they actually do get um a blue version of the vintage shoes so you know good for them but other than that it's pretty much only this one for the men's in terms of color waves and then the tvs it's the same colorway as the vintage is to my knowledge there's no special edition colorway for the tvs at all it's pretty much just this colorway all right now let's talk about the leather so the leather for all three is actually different for all three of them for the um regular eclipses the leather is a lot sturdier and it feels more synthetic-y but it's not like it's not a bad leather it's a pretty decent leather i i like the leather but like i said it's stiff and it feels a lot more plasticky and then once we get to the vintages the leather is buttery smooth but it creases very very easily but it is a nice leather and then lastly we do have the tvs now obviously it's genuine leather you even get a little charm that tells you it says the little charm says the original garment leather athletic shoes so very very nice um but you are paying a higher price and the reason for the higher price is pretty much the leather leather does feel better than the leather on the vintages i wouldn't say it feels like amazingly better um it obviously still creases pretty easily not as easily as the vintages but the tvs do crease obviously it's and the leather is still very soft all right so now we're going to get into some of the little minor differences between the shoes i'm only really going to compare these two from now on just because the tvs and the vintages are almost identical except for the leather really and also because the my vintages are they're pretty dirty so when they're using these are brand new so for the lining on the tvs you get this terry cloth lining that feels really really nice and it feels almost like a towel like material and then for the uh regular club sees you know it's not a towel-like material it's just it's it's a soft material it's pretty much just a regular cloth on the vintages and the tvs you actually get a reebok stamp on the regular club season you don't get anything i'm sorry if you guys can hear the uh lawnmower in the background um i never decided to cut his grass right now so or no it's not a llama it's a blower he decided to blow his yard so um you guys can hear it my bad also the reebok stamps on the back are a little bit different it's kind of hard to tell the differences but they are a little different same with the stamps on the side the reebok logos are a little bit different so i mentioned the lining so the lining in here you it's just a plain lining i'll show you guys in the b-roll but on the lining for the vintages and the tvs you get you know you get a little more detail you get some nice reebok all over print which looks really cool so the tvs and the vintages feel a lot lighter than the regular ones there's a pretty significant difference between the weight also i noticed that the on the vintages and tvs you get an exposed eva but on the regular ones you don't get such a thing it's just straight rubber and also worth mentioning profiles the silhouettes are a little bit different this one has a lower the tvs and the vintages have a little bit lower profile than the regular ones insoles are a little bit different when you compare the tvs and the vintages and then just the regular eclipses they have the same gray eva insole but on the vintages and tvs you get this extra little yellow padding on it so it's a little bit more cushioning than your regular ones um but it's nothing too significant however what was significant and what i found out is i remember trying both of these on and i remember them feeling a little bit different and i was like wow you know like the eva be hitting a little bit different on these it feels a little stiffer in reality is that these have no eva midsole like none at all the rubber i thought it was just i thought the rubber was just covering the eva when in reality there's just no rubber found out when i was comparing the phone the insoles i cut my shoe a little bit i'll show you guys the b-roll but i basically cut this little lining on the bottom to kind of reveal what was under it and under it it's just straight rubber that's it you don't you don't get anything else there's no eva midsole or anything so that pretty much explains why these feel heavier than these ones and why just the regular eclipses they they have this rubber basically so it all started to make sense which is kind of disappointing i really thought they were pretty much all the same except for you know slight differences between like the leather and stuff like that which means objectively that these two are going to be more comfortable so yeah there's that which brings me into my next segway comfort so the regular eclipses you know they're comfortable you know just because they don't have the eva midsole doesn't mean they're oh they're going to be uncomfortable now they're still comfortable they have a very thick insole so it's comfortable and the rubber on the bottom isn't like this super hard rock rubber it's a it's a little bit of a soft rubber and the leather on the toe cap um because the leather is thicker on these ones on your toe they're gonna feel a little bit stiffer so these shoes overall are stiffer they're just a little more sturdier and then when you compare the these two the tvs and the vintages it's just more comfortable just because you have that eva midsole you got the extra little padding on top of the top of the insole and then because the leather is so soft it feels really nice on the toes it doesn't feel like this hard shell when you compare it to just the regular eclipse so objectively these are more comfortable these two versions anyways are going to be more comfortable than the regular reebok club sees all right now on to which one i think you should buy i would buy the regular club c's if you're just looking for more uh color options or if you just don't like this colorway because like i said for these ones you're pretty much only limited to this colorway so for these ones there's a whole lot more color options and they're a little bit cheaper than both of these i mean it's only five bucks cheaper than this one like i said more color options and they're a little bit cheaper just because they don't have the eva midsole doesn't mean they're going to be super uncomfortable or anything like i said they're still going to be very very comfortable and just a just a great shoe overall all right now for the vintages you know obviously if you really care about comfort you should probably get one of these too or if you really also just like the colorway you know this colorway isn't available in this version of the shoe it's literally only limited to the vintage and tvs so if you like the colorway of the shoe you like that old-school look to it definitely recommend this one prefer the klepsie 85 tv um this one i wouldn't really recommend it to a whole lot of people i would only really recommend it if you're that type of person who just really really likes to have that genuine leather shoe you know you really you really you have to have that you know good leather because the leather like i said it is better than the vintages but i don't know if you know it's worth paying 90 or 15 extra dollars when the leather feels a little bit better really it's up to you if you can if you don't mind paying 90 bucks for a little bit better leather for the same shoe then go for it but other than that i think most people they had to choose between this these two they would mostly pick the vintages just because they're gonna be they're gonna be cheaper these are 75 these are 90. that's pretty much it for the video for the differences and everything i hope you guys found that very helpful let me know if you guys have any um suggestions on what other shoes i should compare and do the differences on but other than that

g1Rdrgm1eAY,hey y'all today I'm going to be talking about these reox sneakers that I got I've worn them a few times now and so I wanted to tell you my experience with them one they are super comfortable and I like the look of them they're great for like outside of work or wearing to work I actually wear them to work with like dress locks or a pair of jeans and they look so cute they're neutral colors there's a variation of colors but I wanted to go over the color that I got because I absolutely love it the details are really gentle this isn't white it's like an off-white and ivory so you can get it like a little bit dirty without it being too noticeable additionally this bottom is like a super gentle pink you really can't tell unless you're up close it's really light and really gentle and then the back has like this fun cheetah print it's a little bit of a metallic so it has a pop of color but not too much so I can still go with everything I like that it's neutral because it matches all of my outfits work and both outside of work casual um and like I said you can dress them up with a pair of black dress slacks or you can dress them down with a pair of jeans a pair of leggings right now I'm going to style them with a pair of leggings and show you what they look like so they're really cute and Casual like I said I'm just wearing them with a pair of leggings the other thing I wanted to knowe is they're true to size I'm I'm normally a size 7 and A2 and these are a size 7 and A2 and they fit me perfectly so no need to size up or down just go with whatever your normal size is,2025-06-19 08:38:08.051823 UTC
pegU9blg1vQ,hey guys today I'm going to review the Reebok Club cat5 vintage in the gray color way I managed to hunt down a pair of decent size so I co-taught UK plus 65 pounds which is around so few euros at a time and these shoes are delivered in three days when you cater to Jimmy and I'm pretty excited because these are my first pair of Reeboks and because I've only worn Nikes my entire life the upper of the shoe is made of a really soft leather which is very flexible comfortable and effortless walking the letter crease is quite easily as it is very soft but I don't really mind since it's the aesthetic of the shoe on the side we have two Reebok logo in grey along with a Union Jack and on the medial side it's just plain leather panels with no wordings or logos on a heel of the shoe you do find a Reebok logo in grey there are also a lot of details on the upper such as a thin piece of fabric sewn along the heel multiple layering of letter elements and a lot of non-functional stitches that make the shoe look very defined in terms of support the base is really flat and it does not give you the high boost like you get on an arrow max plus there's a small hue contr which provides more stability on a heel as it locks your heel down to the shoe as you strike and in the toe box area we find three rows of perforations to allow ventilation the tongue is made of a really thick piece of yellow foam which is lined with fabric on the outer side and line for the resolve and microfiber line fabric inner inner side of the shoe the sights are also seams shut so that no foam is exposed on the top of the tongue we also find the Reebok Burma in gray and the classic Reebok logo in grey and red which are all embroidered onto a piece of fabric that extends all the way to the back of the tongue and are stitched together on the same spot the sock liner of the shoe is made of the same material which is found on the back of the tongue and Pat it with a yellow foam underneath it is soft and has a texture of a microfiber cloth the sock liner is relatively thick as well which Nestle's your feet really well and is very comfortable where the insole consists of two layers the upper layer is the microfiber like material which is really soft and the bottom a heart of foamy material which provides most structural support moving on to the midsole the midsole of the shoe is made of a hard foam which is lined with rubber in a darker shade of chalk you can find a rebuff Logan Mira Q and small bumps covering the whole midsole of the shoe on the medial side we have a recessed midsole near arc of the foot and you can see the two layers of foam and rubber the soles are relatively basic which consists of shallow ridges in a diamond crosshatch pattern and a circle surrounded by two concentric circles near the toe area you can also find the Reebok logo around the area where arc of the Fidesz so that's it for the review I'm really happy that I got these shoes because they are really nice I've been looking at them for a long time and they're really comfortable thank you all for watching and I'll close this review with a couple of on foot footage,2025-06-19 08:38:08.256534 UTC
_xdfoeQ9qLo,why rebba club c85 called 85 I was wondering it could be the 85th version because I saw it everywhere through my whole life I Googled it and share you the answer the reason is that club c85 was introduced in 1985 utilized its slightly older sibling the Revenge plus as the base for it no fuss design with pretty straightforward that can be used for varied Fitness activities Reebok took over the gyms and fitness Studios with their simple yet very effective all leather designs from running to tennis to aerobics Reebok absolutely smashed the 80s by introducing classic Styles like the Revenge plus the phase one the workout the classic leather and the club c85 all literally within a few years of each other the rebot club c85 trainer was Reebok's own take on the classic tennis shoe it's one of their most well-known tennis shoes of all time hope,2025-06-19 08:38:08.770266 UTC
i50nq7Ty0io,what's up YouTube for this video let's talk about two very iconic sneakers here we have the Adidas Stan Smiths and here we have the rebok club c85 both of these sneakers are very classic and iconic they've been around for many decades now and they are still arguably some of the most popular shoes to still exist so in this video I want to compare these two shoes and put them head-to-head we're going to talk about price comfort and materials style and then at the end of the video we might have to make a decision as to which between these two shoes are better so you'll want to stick around to the end of the video to find out but hopefully this video will help you with your purchasing decisions if you're considering buying one of these shoes or if you're just wanting to learn more about some of the most classic sneakers of all time so that being said let's get into it so first let's compare the price the reason I wanted to put these two shoes together in a head-to-head battle and compare them together is not only do they have a fairly similar shape and Silhouettes but they also run in a pretty similar price range the St Smiths technically retail for $95 according to the Adidas website but I was able to manage to catch these on sale for about $70 on the contrary with the club C 85s uh these retail for $85 on the website but I was also able to get these on sale for about $70 as well so technically the stand Smiths are a little more expensive at retail for $95 but most times between these two shoes you should be able to find a fairly similar discount on them pretty much for me I was able to get both of these for right around the $70 range all right next let's compare the materials and the Comfort between these two shoes first off starting with the Stan Smiths the upper is mainly comprised of a vegan synthetic leather not too long ago Adidas has made the effort to transition into utilizing more sustainable materials so now based on the website they utilize about 50% of recycled materials uh for their uppers so you pretty much got vegan synthetic leather throughout the upper here and through the tongue and then as we move to the bottom portion of the shoe the out soole is pretty much a rubberized outsole and then the midle here although it's kind of a bit on the firm side that will mean that it provides its standard Arch stability and support now as for the club C 85s the upper on these is made of more of a nice soft and plush pebbled leather the toe box is nice and soft to the touch but moving on to the tongue and the inner lining of this shoe it's made of more of like a mesh type of material for the midsole cushioning you have the Eva midsole and then the out soole of these is also a rubberized outsole just like the Stan Smiths but personally for me I would choose a Rebox over the Adidas in terms of comfort for a few reasons reason number one is that the upper and the leather on these is a little more soft and plush to the touch and it also gives the toe boox a little more flexibility reason number two is I also get a little more rear foot stability in the club c 85s as well given the mesh inner lining and not sure if you can see it but there's also a bit of a divot or a support in the Achilles area in the back heel part here whereas the rear foot part of the Stan Smiths is the inner lining is a little bit more of that smooth vegan leather uh so it doesn't quite hug my heel as nicely as a Rebox and reason number three is that I tend to have a little bit more standard maybe even narrow feet the club c85 is run a little more narrow which means it hugs my foot a little better so on the contrary if you do have wider feet I would suggest you go with the Stan Smiths over the Rebox I actually made a video sometime in the past regarding how to choose the proper foot wear for your foot shape I'll leave the card up top somewhere over there but uh check out that video after you finish this one if you want to learn more about the science behind finding your proper Footwear all in all even though I personally chose the club c85 over the Dan Smith's for Comfort uh take my advice with a grain of salt the differences between the two are actually pretty negligible and you don't really notice it unless you actually wear both of these shoes time and time again but either way it's always best if you can just try the shoes for yourself in order to make the most Sound Decision for yourself all right next let's talk about style between these two shoes now this part is very subjective as each person has their own personal style and taste but here is my personal take both of these tennis sneakers have a lot of similarities to offer from theow top shape and Silhouettes the mostly white uppers you have the flat laces you have the stitched in moles you have the rubberized outsoles and even with these two pairs in particular you have the subtle green accents for The Branding but where I feel like these two shoes stand out in terms of style is their utilization of their materials as well as the consideration of where these shoes stand in the fashion scene so what do I mean by that let's talk about the Stan Smiths first in terms of the Stan Smiths I feel I feel like in general these shoes are a little more popular and they tend to cater more to the high-end fashion industry from my research I feel like there have been more celebrities that have endorsed and been caught wearing these shoes out there have been photos of like the Jonas Brothers Kendall Jenner Jessica Alba Haley Bieber Justin Timberlake the Kardashians and even Kanye himself so not only has more high-end celebrities been caught wearing these shoes but I feel like the high-end fashion brand FS have also caught more inspiration from their designs off this dance SMS so for some examples you have Clay Footwear making their shoe called the Bradley's which run for about $150 you have the common projects with their retro lows which run for I think $400 and then you have the Alexander McQueens which run for about $600 and I don't think you can deny that although they're different shoes they have some similarities and they probably drew some level of inspiration from the Stan Smiths on the other hand with the club C8 I in my opinion they just don't seem as popular this is not at all to take away from the club the 85s they're not any less stylish than the St Smiths are but just in terms of society and the industry you just don't see the club C 85s having as much traction as the Stan Smiths do all in all both shoes have a lot of similarities to offer in terms of style they've both been worn by all types of people they're both very versatile and can be dressed up and dressed down so really you can't go wrong with either option in terms of style but over overall my take in terms of style is that if you want to be a little more trendy if you want to follow more of the high-end celebrities or if you want to look a little more upscale in terms of the fashion scene then I would go with the stance SMS if you want to be a little more low profile still have a good quality sneaker without the popularity and The Branding behind what everyone else is doing I would go with the club c85 so after briefly comparing these two shoes here are my overall thoughts when it comes to price the St Smiths retail for9 $95 but the Rebox retail for $85 which technically makes these the more affordable option on the list personally though I was able to attain both of these shoes for around the $70 range but if you are trying to buy these at full price rebok are the more affordable option when it comes to comfort this is subjective but I personally feel like I prefer the comfort of the club C 85s over the Stan Smiths the uppers on the Rebox are just more plush more soft more flexible in the toe box and I do get a little more rear foot stability in the Rebox as well compared to the Stan Smiths lastly in terms of style I might have to choose the Stan Smiths over the club 85s the Stan Smiths have technically been around for a longer period of time but although both of these shoes are very classic and Timeless for years to come I think the Stan Smiths are generally a more popular and respectable shoe they have a bit of a richer history and I think that does speak volumes when you see higher-end celebrities and high-end fashion brands uh show their appreciation for this shoe in particular all in all both of these tennis sneakers are great options to have in your sneaker rotation and you really cannot go wrong with either option I would love to hear your thoughts in the comments below which between these two would you choose or if you've already tried these shoes how do you style them I'd love to hear about it in the comments below if you made it this far in the video please do me a huge favor hit that like button it'll help me out a lot and

3aM1mUg9rf8,okay so here we are talking about shoes yet again and this time i want to talk about my top four vintage inspired shoes so if you've been here before you know that i am enamored with minimal shoes that's my thing i love minimal shoes i'm always seeking them out i've done quite a few videos on them so i thought i'd change it up a little bit and something else i love here is vintage style throwback stuff and so i came across a bunch of shoes that i just really liked and made me hanker back to a different time and i want to showcase those for you but first my name is timothy sands and this is fashionable father if you're one of the lucky early subscribers welcome back if you're new here i present content to inspire men to present their best selves that intrigues you subscribe if you're so inclined okay so first up is cariuma i think that's how you pronounce it these are made in brazil they're a skater shoe so when i first saw them i was thinking oh yeah vans all day but since they're made in brazil they got this cool style to them yes look at that branding it's pretty bold but also just sleek enough and cool enough for me the cream color that throws back it has this like very utilitarian like canvas on them that i'm loving now yes they are a skater shoe through and through like the soles are built for skating they have um a reinforced like flip i don't skate so does that make me a poser do people still use the term poser i don't know anyways um i love it i like the concept of it i think they would look great with cropped pants they have again this awesome vintage throwback feel to them they're also a cool company they claim that they take care of their employees that the work environment is good and also they plant two trees for every shoe they sell so that's pretty cool okay so up next we got another tennis shoe you can see where i'm going with this and these are clay deans i've featured clay here before i like their shoe i like the company they're based right here in la what i love about these though is i feel like they got this adidas feel to them or adidas i should say but yeah but just cooler and sleeker and i like the color on the back you can get different colors i think there's blue i got the green the cream sole is so so cool and again it's kind of got this vintage feel to it not a gum sole which is really popular right now i feel i actually really really feel in that cream the details on it are nice and refined and i think that's also what's cool about this is it's got a vintage feel but it's also sleek and and pretty nicely detailed with the suede and of course amazing leather that you could really dress this shoe up you could wear it with a nice pair of trousers of course you could wear it with some jeans and maybe even rock them with some slacks i don't know if i'd go as far as with a suit maybe maybe a casual suit these could go well with okay next up i went a little rogue got a little different and got me a slipper that's right look at that now this anchors back to my minimal shoes it barely has a sole on them it literally is a slipper but you know how things are right now they're wearing these out and about it doesn't have enough of a sole that you can wear them you know in the streets don't don't wear them in any weather but i know what you're thinking vintage what's vintage about these these remind me of you old man wearing his slippers around the house and of course i know you gen z norm core fashion types are going to love this concept looking like an old man and dressing dressing down but this also such a sleek cool slipper that you can rock with anything if you ask me now you know me i love me some minimalism and i love this minimal design it is deer skin so that's ridiculous and it's ridiculously soft and ridiculously comfortable but yeah i feel like you can rock these with a lot of different things obviously as i'm alluding to rock it with some norm core but you can also rock it with a suit you can rock it with some trousers you can rock it with some slacks you can rock it with a robe i don't know okay that was weird i just lost power in my house and then turned all back on okay so what was i talking about you can rock these with trousers you can rock these with slacks you can rock these with suits you can rock with this with a robe i think i said that earlier anyways um yeah i love these i think these are a cool very sleek shoe and i like the vintage feel to them i i think these slippers anchor back to what your old man would wear up next are my favorite might already know what i'm talking about if you paid attention at all but i had to do a little journey to go get them i decided why why buying them online when you can go maybe find them in the city so let's go back in time and join me on my journey into la over two that's right the grove we haven't been there in a year probably plus yeah are you excited i'm excited to get out of here so [Applause] so do [Applause] we got some shoes we got makeup i was trying i was really trying to get her to try something on in northern gyms she refused so terrible she's refused they're awful they're holding my size right aren't these just so cool so unlike the other shoes in the video these are definitely full on vintage these these shoes i feel like my brother owned a pair when i was growing up yeah reebok club c85s now they come in multiple colors the really cool color is the cream with the turquoise and um i couldn't i don't think they had those well they didn't have those at j crew so i just wanted to make sure i got a pair and i loved them i fell in love with him as soon as i saw him look at that badge on the toe that is so cool that is so cool and i just reeboks were so they were the shoe like nike was passe like no one was even wearing nike and everybody's wearing reeboks and then like michael jordan descended from the heavens and got jordan errors going or whatever they were and nike just took over at that point and reebok didn't have a chance but for a while man these were the only shoes on the block and i love them i think they're really cool i love the style of them i actually was kind of shocked how much i was going to like them i thought it was like eh they're cool they're a throwback shoe nah i'm loving them i think they're sweet i love the style of them i love all the stitching and the design and it just you know does bring back memories and i feel like these were more of like a late 80s shoe not exactly into the 90s so i kind of miss the boat on these and and i love them and and i i love the style on them they're just cool you can wear these with shorts you can wear these with jeans you can wear them with some trousers i would not rock these with a suit that's for sure blue trousers with that right there i mean come on you can't go wrong with that and i love the design of the of the suede right here the gray suede you can tell i'm enamored and it's all right so so those are my top four vintage styled shoes for this spring take a look at them i'm excited by them i think they're gonna be shoes that you're going to want to rock coming out of this crazy last year and and having some fun times out there and enjoying your fashion for the first time in a long time right all right so my name is timothy sands and this is my story of fashion and fatherhood if you've been watching this long you gotta hit the like button it helps me out and also helps with the algorithm and if you like this video probably like this video right here this has to do with my top sustainable shoes and that one is pretty entertaining too and it kind of goes rogue and it doesn't you know not one of my normal shoe videos about minimal shoes and always remember never forget style first see on the flip side,2025-06-19 08:38:09.748352 UTC
JItQ5lFEnlA,now this video is probably going to ruffle some feathers but just remember this is all very personal to me in no way should my experience with these sneakers put you off wearing them or stop you buying them if you love them also my taste changes over time so who knows I might love them again at some point but right now these are the sneakers that I regret buying the most part two if you like this video at any point and it doesn't make you too angry then please feel free to drop it a like and now that's all out the way let's get into the sneakers so so first up we've got my Marella gats so where do I even start with this one this one's a mess okay so the first pair I got of these were too big for me and rather than sending them back for another size I got scared but basically when I was trying them on in my house I was walking around in them as you do when you're trying on shoes and I put some tiny creases in the toe box and because of this I felt like I could no longer send them back so instead I sold them for a loss on Depot I then used the money I got from those plus more to get smaller size and after all of that I've worn them about twice in the last 2 years I love the look of the shoe and I love how they look on others but I can't make them work for me in the way that I want and whenever I see myself in these they don't match up with the look that I've got in my head if that makes sense and coming in at £500 and wearing them twice in the last 2 years does that sound like money well spent to you because it doesn't to me anyway let's move on to another pair of sneakers before I start crying over the amount of money I spent on these next up I've got the Adidas gazelle in the blue colorway so the Adidas gazelle indor is one of my favorite sneakers so I thought it was a good idea to pick it up in multiple colors the first pair I got were in green and I wore them so much I decided to pick them up in the blue color way as well now I actually prefer the color of the blue pair to look at but they're just so bright that I never want to wear them for me the green pair are a lot more subtle and a lot more versatile so if I'm going to wear these sneakers then I'll always wear that pair in fact I've never worn the blue pair out inside the house so they were a waste of money for me but I think the other reason I bought these shoes is they were selling out like hot cakes and because I love the look of them so much I didn't want to miss out on them so I didn't think too much and just bought them but yeah even though I love the look of these sneakers they're just not that wearable for me so that's why they're on this list next up I've got the Adidas sber now I wish these sneakers weren't on this list but they have to be because my feet have never got on with them at first when I was breaking these in they ripped my heels to shreds and they were so painful I looked like an extra from 28 Days Later or The Walking Dead Walking Down the Road in these it wasn't a great look and then after the whole heel shredding phase was over I just find them a little bit too tight and uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time and when I own a pair of shoes like the Adidas gazel that give off a similar look but are a lot more comfortable I'm going to go for those every time it's a shame because I really do love these sneakers and I know a lot of people find them really comfortable so maybe they're just not made for my feet and next up I've got the oniska tiger GSM so if you've been subscribed to my channel for a while now you're probably a bit surprised to see this sneaker on this list because I absolutely loved them and I still do but I think this shoe suited my old style really well when I was into the whole clean cut scandy streetwear kind of look and I've since moved away from that these days I like to go for the more darker and edgier looks and I find this sneaker is too clean cut for that and when I first bought these I was just coming out of my old style and into my new style so they never got the we they deserved and after holding on to these for a good while I finally decided to let them go and give them to a home that would enjoy them more than I would and hopefully they're having the time of their lives with their new owner and getting the love and wear that they deserve but yeah a great pair of shoes and excellent quality too but just not right for me right now but let's move on next up we have my pair of oniska tiger Mexico 66s now it sounds like I don't like onuka tiger sneakers from this video but you couldn't be further from the truth I love their sneakers I think they're incredible but I just think they might not be right for me right now but anyway I picked up a pair of their Mexico 66s in the black and white colorway last summer and since then I've worned them a grand total of zero times whenever I try them on with an outfit I always think to myself yeah they look all right but I think another pair of sneakers would look better or a pair of shoes so I end up swapping them out for whichever pair I think would look better on the plus side I find them really comfortable they feel great on my feed I just can't put my finger on why I don't love them on me anyway unlike my other pair of onx tigers that I thought I would never wear so I sold on I do think this pair will have their time for me so I'm holding on to them but until these do have their moment for me I think they're going to have to go down as a regret next up I have the van skate high and even though I still love them they're going in this list I swear I've said I love every sneaker on this list so far but it's true I wouldn't have bought any of them if I didn't love the look of them in the first place but sometimes things just don't work out as you'd hoped anyway these fit me well and they look cool but there's something about Vans at the moment that's stopping me wanting to wear them and I have two theories about why that might be which I'm going to tell you about now so firstly these remind me of my Converse Chuck 70s and if you didn't know already I'm a massive Converse fan so I'll normally choose to wear those over these every time the other thing is I grew up wearing vans so I kind of associate them with my younger self and I'm not sure if I want that I kind of feel like I'm going backwards whenever I wear them and I want to wear new things does that make sense but on the other hand or foot because I wore Vans growing up I've still got a soft spot for them and that's why I bought these but for the other reasons I just mentioned I've barely worn these and that's why they're on this list now the next one is probably going to upset a lot of you but just remember this is all very personal to me but it's the rebot club c85 now I've had a few pairs of these over my lifetime and I used to absolutely love wearing these shoes and I think the pair I've got currently are my fourth pair but unlike my other pairs I've hardly worn these I still think they're a cool shoe and I still like them but I don't get excited about wearing them these days I think back in the day I used to see this shoe as a slim profile shoe that goes with everything that's really Sleek but since then I've owned so many other sleeker trainers that I don't see them in the same way anymore I think they look a little bit clumsy and a little bit bulky at times and I suppose you could say that adds to their charm but it's just not doing it for me at the moment I'm not really a fan of the way these age either they crease in a way that I don't really like and yeah I probably would have been better off not buying this pair is anyone else with me on this one or are you all screaming at your screens calling me an idiot let me know how you're feeling next up I've got the Adidas hble specials now when I first got these shoes I absolutely loved them and I wanted to wear them all the time they were really comfortable they fit me well and they went with everything but ever since I got my gazelle indoors I feel like all my other Adidas sneakers have taken a bit of a back seat and I don't really need them anymore and I think that's the problem when you buy things that are so similar to one another there'll always be one pair that you like more than the other pairs so whenever you wear the other pairs you think to yourself well these look good but the gazel would look better so I'm just going to wear them instead well that's what I think anyway but then I look at this pair and I think they look absolutely delicious so maybe I'm just bored of my pair in the black colorway but these are too similar to my green gazel so I'm going to have to stop myself buying them but they do look good don't they but after all this would I recommend any of the sneakers on this list yes I would 100% I'd actually recommend all of them providing that you love them and that you'll actually wear them they're all great sneakers they're all classics but I just didn't need to buy all of them I think with the job I'm in I've definitely got carried away with buying more than I need in the past and this is the result of that I'm a lot more careful with my purchases these days and I don't think I bought a pair of sneakers this year yet but I hope you enjoyed this one if you did please do leave the video a like don't forget to hit subscribe and thank you so much for watching see you later,2025-06-19 08:38:09.903097 UTC
b2dJvSbiWvI,uh finally for the late nights hey what's going on youtube today we're going to be looking at specifically the club c85 revenge shoes and the club memt shoes and we're going to be comparing them to the club c85 vintage shoes and the regular clip cd5s so this is pretty much going to be like a part 2 to the original club cd5 comparison video where i compared the club c85 club c85 vintage and the club c85 tv definitely go check out that video if you guys want to know more about the club cd5 tvs because i'm not going to be including them in this video so just like the last comparison video we're going to be comparing the price some visual differences leather quality color and lastly comfort after that i'm pretty much going to be giving my opinion on which ones i believe you should buy so let's get into it so starting right off the bat with the prices the club c revenge shoe retails for between about 70 to 80 depending on the colorway the club me and t shoes retail for 59.99 so they're actually the least expensive out of all of these seeing as the club c85s retail for about 70 dollars while the club c85 vintage retails for about 75 now for some visual differences starting off with the revenge shoes the most obvious difference is gonna be that striped colored underlay going across the shoe that's like the main difference but there are smaller differences like for example the leather on the regular club c85s actually looks like it is a little bit thicker than the one on the revenge shoes it's just a little bit thicker but in my opinion it really contributes to the club see having a little bit of a bulkier look than the revenge it could just be maybe it was made in a different factory and that's why the leather on these shoes seems a bit bulkier it could also just be that it's my pair that you know has a maybe thicker cut of leather uh i'm not really sure so definitely take this with a bit of a grain of salt but overall like i said bravenchu actually seems to be a bit sleeker while the club c85 shoe tends to look a little bit bulkier the opening of the revenge actually sits at the same height as the regular club c which i mentioned in my previous video that actually sits higher than the vintage shoe i feel like the overall silhouette is more similar to the vintage than the regular clip c also similar to the vintage is the fact that it has the terry cloth lining so the main difference pretty much is going to be that this one has the same cut as the regular club sees except the material seems to be a bit thinner so the overall silhouette is more like the vintage and this has the stripe going down and also the terry cloth lining so that's to be the main difference between this shoe and the regular eclipse now for the club memts the main difference on this one is going to be the fact that the upper actually has a different cut from the rest of the shoes for example it does have a similar stripe just like the revenge but it also does include a heel counter that the rest of the shoes don't have and it also has little notches on the end of the toe overlay also the rubber outsole is going to be completely different from the other club c85s it's completely absent of the little dotted pattern that it has on the other clip c85s and instead we get this kind of striped pattern on the heel also the tread pattern is completely different as well we get a nice hexagonal pattern with some stripes i also forgot to mention that the toe perforation pattern is slightly different as well also the leather is the thinnest out of all the shoes thus making it the slimmest and sleekest out of all the shoes as well now i'm not a leather expert or anything i'm just going to be explaining how i think the leather feels in my opinion on the revenge shoes the leather is pretty soft but it doesn't feel as soft as the vintage leathers these ones have a extremely extremely soft leather but it also doesn't feel as kind of stiff as the regular club sees so it really kind of feels like it's you know that middle ground so it's right in between the leather of these two shoes as for the leather on the club memts it definitely feels a bit more synthetic which is pretty much to be expected since the leather is the thinnest and it's also the least expensive out of all the shoes here if you guys want to know a bit more about the leather on the tvs like i said definitely go check out that first comparison video now on to the color for the revenge shoes the colorways definitely seem to be a bit more colorful for these ones when compared to the regular club seas they definitely use that stripe to definitely add a splash of color and to kind of help color block the whole shoe which is very different to something like the club c85 for the memts the colorways are actually a bit simpler they're very similar to something like the regular club cd5s on their website they pretty much just have kind of the basic colors colorways that are very similar to the regular eclipse 85 so the revenge has the most colorful colorways out of all the models while the club me and ts are going to have more basic colorways similar to the regular eclipses for the comfort of the shoes all the shoes are going to be comfortable but i'm obviously still going to rank them so the most comfortable shoes in my opinion are going to be the vintage club cd5s they have an eva foam midsole that's lightweight and really helps with the comfort of the shoe it also has this buttery soft leather that feels really good around the foot especially in the toe box area after that surprisingly i wouldn't pick them emts with the memory foam insole in my opinion the revenges and the regular klepsies are going to be more comfortable than the memts reason for that is that the memts have this thinner outsole so you're going to be closer to the ground and you're going to feel more of it also the memory foam insole really doesn't help much just because it compresses so easily the other two have a thicker outsole and a responsive insole so they just feel overall more comfortable kind of disappointed in the memts i was really hyped about that memory insole but maybe after breaking them in they'll feel more comfortable but for now they're gonna be the least comfortable out of the four so which one should you buy if you really like the kind of old-school styling of the club c85 the kind of original styling and you want the shoe with the most comfort you really can't go wrong with the vintages you're definitely going to want to pick up this pair if you want more kind of like the basic club c85 just pick up the regulars they come in more color ways than the vintages so the colorways are going to be more varied and these are going to be at a good price they're going to be 70 bucks so i suspect that most people are going to choose you know these two these these two are the more popular models now if you want a shoe with more varied color ways and you like that stripe down the side definitely the revenge shoes these are a solid pick and for 70 to 80 dollars depending on the colorway they might be more or less expensive but a nice plus is that you do get that terry cloth lining now if you want the most bang for your buck i would definitely recommend the memts they have a very similar styling it's not identical but it's extremely similar styling the leather quality is going to be a bit lacking but for 60 bucks it's really a good value for the shoe especially if you can get these on sale so that's gonna be it for the video i really hope you guys enjoyed the video and found it helpful let me know down in the comments if there's any other shoes you guys want me to compare or you guys would like to see on the channel i got more shoe content coming in the future so definitely look out for that and i'll see you guys in the next one let's reebok slogan be more human for real that's a pretty horrible slogan could have been something like uk's finest block whole lotta buck any of the slogans would have been a thousand times better than be more human they definitely need to change

9efeyruWZ24,today I'm talking about one of Adidas most iconic shoes the Stan Smith's and I'm comparing the Stan Smith's to the Stan Smith luxes what's the difference which one is better should you buy either of them well that's what I'm talking about on this video right here hey it's Kurt welcome to my channel where I review Fitness Products through a cost analysis on them and then give them my own rating from my own rating system to see if the item is worth purchasing or not I buy all my products with my own money for unbiased reviews although sometimes I am given a product for free if that's the case I will always let you know at the beginning of the video now I bought these Stan Smith's about eight months ago nine months ago because I just wanted a simple everyday walking shoe and they've worked out great there are a lot of things I liked about them from their comfort to their old school style and their price I also get a lot of compliments when I wear them from people in their 20s all the way up to their 50s they obviously still have that cool aura about them in my opinion they are low-key understated and have a sense of style and class that are unreplicated by any other shoe I think the closest iconic shoes to the Stan Smith are maybe some old school Air Jordans so this is what I got in September they were 95 five dollars back then now they are a hundred dollars inflation of course they have a vegan upper and an outsole made of rubber waste it is also made with prime green a series of high performance recycled materials fifty percent of the upper is recycled content with no virgin polyester it seems like Adidas basically has changed the Stan Smith's for the better of the environment and I can't fault them for that but what if you didn't want to wear a shoe with all this recycle stuff in it and you just wanted to wear a pure leather version what could you buy then these the Stan Smith luxes like I did the Lux is crafted with buttery soft leather from the inner lining to the extra leather patch and the heel that provides heightened comfort and durability in addition the foil branding on the tongue has a simple yet elegant finish it's billed as the classic Stan Smith shoe with luxury details and premium leather I opted for the crystal white off-white core Black Version because I want to make sure that the two shoes look different enough when I was testing so you guys could tell the difference I also wanted a shoe that was a different color so I could wear them along with my green ones the price 145 dollars but I did notice there was a 160 dollar version of the same exact shoe and that's if you got the cloud white Wonder white chalk White Version so what were the parameters of this test kind of simple really I've had these for like I said about eight months I've had these for about a week I wore these every day last week I've worn these for eight months so is it a fair comparison not exactly but enough time to give you at least my first impressions of these shoes now let's look at each shoe individually so you can kind of get the whole picture first the Stan Smith's vegan upper outsole made from rubber waste the Stan Smith Luxe leather upper outsole made from rubber as well the outsoles of both shoes actually look the same as well as the bottom of the shoes I'm not sure if both shoes outsoles are made the same but they look really similar back to the Stan Smith's the pull tab looks like it's vegan as well and the top line or color kind of looks like this now the tongue is made of one piece with no stitching and appears to be made of vegan materials on the Stan Smith luxes the pull tab looks like it's made of leather also on the top line or collar it looks very different than the Stan Smiths it looks like there's a lot more detail put into it the pull tab black leather almost folds over into another piece of leather that separates the outside of the shoe from the inside of the shoe now the tongue is also one piece but it's got stitching around it which makes it look a little more premium the insole of the Stan Smith looks to be made of something other than leather and it's got the prime green and plastic waste logo in it this is a funny thing to say but the laces look a little puffier almost like they're not as nice as the laces on the Luxe model and then of course on the back of the pull tab you've got the white Adidas logo here's where the Stan Smith luxes kind of start giving you those premium things that add to the whole Allure of this shoe it has an inner extra leather patch that's off-white for more comfort in the heel an embossed black logo on the rear of the pull tab the insole appears to be made of leather with the classic Adidas logo and it has the brand with the three stripes brand copy line in it and the way the shoe comes together at the back is different as well you'll see that there's only one stitching line in the luxes and there's an extra piece of material back there with three stitchings on the Stan Smiths and in the Luxe model you'll see on the outside of both uppers that the name Stan Smith is printed on them after that examination both shoes let's get to some questions I had about them and you might have about them as well which ones were more comfortable this was a lot harder to decide than I thought at first I thought for sure the Stan Smith's would be less comfortable than the Stan Smith luxes I was kind of wrong about this they do have slightly different feels but they're both comfortable I did notice that when I was wearing the luxes they were incredibly comfortable and I would probably give them maybe I don't know one more point for Comfort after wearing them all day at my office I totally forgot I had them on they're just so comfortable they just mold right to your feet and they don't have this huge Heel To Toe drop but they have enough padding where your feet aren't going to get sore through the day walking on concrete so slight Edge and comfort to the luxes but not by much are they an everyday shoe yeah I'd say both of these are an everyday shoe and that's what I said before I got two different colors because I could wear these every single day with different outfits if I wanted to and I really like them a lot I don't think I need any more of these Adidas Stan Smith or else I risk being named as the Stan Smith dude how did you keep them clean well I've had these Stan Smiths like I said for about eight months I just washed them with water today I do have a few Marks here that I can't get out with water but I'm going to use isopropyl like 99.9 percent and that usually works pretty well but that's the great thing about not having a leather shoe when you get marks on it you just get some isopropyl wipe it off no problem you don't want to do that with leather shoes that's for sure because it might do something weird to the leather you probably want to get some nice leather shoe cleaner which I will buy for sure for the Lexus when they get kind of marked up do you see a lot of people wearing them incredibly even though this is one of Adidas most popular shoes I don't see them around that much and that's what I like about them as well and people still make comments say hey nice shoes they are literally the only shoes I have that anybody's ever said anything about that doesn't really matter much but it does make me feel slightly cooler any weird things about the shoe here's something that maybe you don't think about but I think about or maybe you do think about but there's something about the smell of a leather shoe it's really nice I mean you don't smell the shoes when you're walking but when you get them out of the box then you smell that leather wow that's a that's attractive I had nothing weird happened to me with the basic Stan Smith but the Stan Smith luxes I did have something weird happen sometimes leather shoes develop some sort of squeak when you walk and it's really annoying because they look really nice and you'll be walking down the hallway with somebody in here this kind of ER so I did develop a slight little squeak in my luxes which I'm totally bummed about I don't even know how to get rid of that it's kind of like having squeaky brakes on your car impossible to fix by the way the normal stance Miss no squeaks whatsoever is there anything to watch out for when purchasing I know a lot of shoes have weird sizing so like if you're a 10 you might be an 11 another shoe or if you're a 10-1 shoe you might be a nine in another shoe I wear a size 10 shoe and I ordered a size 10 shoe and it fits perfectly another thing to keep in mind is since the Stan Smith shoe is so popular they're coming out with tons of different models of them so be very careful before purchasing make sure you're buying the right shoe with that being said let's get to the pros and cons of both of these shoes first the pros for the Stan Smiths they're comfortable they're a great price at a hundred dollars easy to clean and they stay white for a long time on their own they're made of vegan leather and made of 50 recyclables here's a Pros for the Stan Smith luxes all leather great subtle accents on the shoe that give them a premium look and they're very comfortable now the cons for the Stan Smiths not as nostalgic looking don't look as premium here's the cons for the Stan Smith luxes they're higher maintenance to keep them clean I got a little squeak from them when I walked and this is a personal peeve of mine I don't like a lot of branding on shoes I like them clear of branding and on the luxes they put the name Stan Smith on the shoe as if to say hey everybody remember these are Stan Smith's and I don't really like that I like just things a little more subtle but hey that might not bother you so what's the verdict which pair would you choose if you could only choose one believe it or not I'd have to give the regular Stan Smith a slight Edge and then right them as an 8 out of 10. although I love the Stan Smith luxes they're just a little more high maintenance and that squeak kind of bug me so I'm going to give those a 7 out of 10. both shoes are very cool though and you can't really go wrong with either one all right I'm gonna end this video here thank you so much for watching if you like this video do me a favor hit that like button and of course

ecTFwGItbJE,for episode two of the white sneaker series were cut in half the shoes that might have started the whole white sneaker trend Stan Smith's before we get to the sneakers I want to tell you about the father's day sell I'm doing on the wallets and the re-release of the Clayton wall it's been on hiatus and I've slowly been redesigning it over the last couple years and this is one of the wallets I'm more proud of because where most people would do a stitch line I figured out how to fold it so this seven pocket wallet only has four stitch slides throughout the whole wallet and for Father's Day you can get 10% off any of the wallets including this one and a free set of matching coasters until the Father's Day with the code leather dad now to the information on these sneakers so the brand is adidas the style is a Stan Smith's the colorway is the triple cloud light they retail for $80 on their site and they're made in India and the backstory in the shoes is pretty interesting and if you want to see a full video on this nacho average finds does a really good video but all started about sixty years ago in the early 60s when this shoe was released and became the first widely successful leather shoes made for tennis tennis shoes and it was originally under a different tennis players name his name was Robert Hale it but after he retired they needed a new spokesman for the shoe that's where they found Stan Smith and Stan Smith took the shoe to the height of its professional success but as the shoe sneaker technology kind of evolved these transition to more of the street where we're going to have everyday tennis shoe and they've kind of just been popular ever since and you kind of see a lot of the design elements and lines of these shoes reflected in the more modern she was like the common projects so kind of an interesting story now let's talk about what we know about these shoes and the construction before we start cutting them in half starting with the leather so we look at the cross-section you can tell it's a chrome tan leather because see that bluing on the inside and we also don't see any grain structure on there and what does the grain structure it's that top layer of the cross-section of whether that's a really tightly knit fiber structure that gives you that smooth leather fill if you were to look at this shoe from the outside you say hey that's pretty smooth I don't see any fuzzies on there looks like there's some pores on there but that's not the grain that is a layer of plastic with a leather looking print embossed into the leather or into the plastic and the reason they call this other splits is at the tannery leather in its natural state is pretty often too thick for whatever application they're wanting to use it for so they have to split it down into thinner thicknesses and they do that by putting it through machine that's literally just splits it in half and that top portion has that highly sought after grain structure that gives you that smooth fill and then that bottom part is the splits where it's all that fuzzy stuff and that top portion with the grain usually goes the more expensive high-end leather products that split portion is usually processed one or two ways it's the left fuzzy they call suede or they refinish that top fuzziness with a fake looking grain structure or top layer of plastic like what we see in these and it kind of just makes it look like a grain leather so split leather is usually cheaper and usually see in Cheaper products and it's not as strong and because they have to put a plastic coating on top a lot of times that plastic coating is gonna flake off and kind of split before a grain structured leather would and looking at these shoes I don't think this tongue is leather I don't think the linings leather and I don't think it's a little cap around the back is leather I think just the side panels or whether but we'll see when we cut in half next we can see this is a cup sole construction that's cemented and stitched just around the toe I don't need I don't really know if this is actual stitching or if it's just a faux stitch I guess we'll see we cut it in half and then the insole I can get it out this has a little piece of double-sided tape holding it in there and this is a north and light foam which is a little higher quality foam than just like a cheap open cell foam that feels like camping pad and then we can see that there's cattle weaved you know know what actually it looks like there's two separate so I think there's actually with this particular shoe two different insoles in there because this right shoe is kind of a fiber board and this left shoe is kind of a weaved material so that was unexpected so yeah I guess next we'll cut them in half to see what's going on inside hearing that's really weird all right I've got a cut in half let's see what's inside now let's go through the layers starting with the leather first so which piece is our leather in which part so the toe these side panels this little strip on the back here are the leather and then the liner the little heel cap here and the tongue or not leather now that we've got a nice clean cross-section let's see if I was right about the portion the leather it comes from if we take a really really close-up look I think I might actually be wrong I think there's just a little teeny sliver of grain in there so let's do a little bit test cut test think and see and if I cut just a little teeny bit off you can see there is actually a little bit of grain in there so I was wrong just like every video so it looks like the this is I doubt it's a calfskin based on the price point so it's probably what they call a top grain leather where they buff off that very top section of the grain and just leave a little bit in there makes they do that to make it and really even and consistent finish it just doesn't have as much grain that's why I love doing these actual cut in halves because you really get to see what's really going on inside these shoes now for the layers starting with the outsole so I've got this cup sole and it's surprisingly thin and the little cells on the inside of here are really loose and floppy so that's why when you put these on they're squishing it first it's not because there's lots of foam in there it's because these cells are super loose and after a while these are going to compress and break it's gonna be a little uncomfortable that's probably why these we're out faster than a premium shoe and then we move up to the insult which is kind of a surprise question this episode is is this the same insole on the left shoe as the right so I'm going to cut a little slit route of this one to see if it's the same material okay we got the little sliver taken out and after looking at it I can see that it is the same material from the left to the right shoe ones just put the one way the others look the other way so I don't know if that's a quality control issue or if it's a way that they do the manufacturing from the left shoe to the right shoe I definitely know and then to the last question I had before cutting these in half does this stitch around the toe a real structural stitch or is it just like a postage for looks if you look inside here you can see the stitching does stitch the upper to the sole so that's good to see so the last thing what is the difference between the Stan Smith's and the premium shoes that we have done and probably will continue to do the three main things that I noticed was the first thing in the Stan Smith's are going to get a cheaper a leather one that's gonna have a plastic coating on top and you're gonna get some fake leather the next thing was the way that it's built so on the Stan Smith's you guys really really thin matted material that as you wear this these little cells on the inside alright don't have the structure to compress evenly and you're gonna get some high spots and low spots in the heel and it's just not going to it's not going to mold to the shape of your foot like a fiber board and a compressed cardboard is going to do like in the premium ones and then do the final thing so that is the construction so this is mostly a cemented construction with some stitching on it versus the more premium ones are going to have a stitch line all the way through and a higher-quality sole so those are the three main differences it's kind of up to you if you are ok with those things 80 bucks you can usually get them on sale for a little bit cheaper not a bad price not a bad shoe got some leather in it but they're not gonna last as long so that pretty much wraps it up and let me know what you guys think do you think they're worth the money do you think I missed something in here and let me know what other shoes you want to do and let the companies know which shoes you want to see if there's on this channel cuz it helps me get sponsors and helps you see the shoes you want

8f5UrOGvDqA,what is that my friends welcome back to your average jens my name is evan if you watched my video on things that will never go out of style you'll probably guessed that i love white sneakers because they look clean they're super versatile and they are easy to pair with anything and i especially love the converse Chuck Taylors I've been wearing them since secondary school that's more than ten years ago my goodness this pair is more than two years old and since it's gonna fall apart soon and I really want to try something new I've decided to get a pair Adi does Stan Smith which is on my wish list for quite a while already but don't worry Chuck's you'll always be my first look anyway I ordered this pair of Stan Smith about two months ago and I've been wearing it regularly recently and in today's video I'm gonna be giving my review of this pair of sweet kicks my review will be based on its aesthetics comfortability affordability durability and versatility first let's talk about is aesthetics how it looks undoubtedly one of the most iconic sneaker design I gotta say I really like the design and its silhouette it has a really slim profile although not as slim as the Chuck Taylors but it definitely does not look chunky at all I love how the design is really clean and minimalistic and even the adidas 3 stripes are just perforated at the sides I also much prefer the all-white version because the logos on the tongue and at the back of the shoe are much more subtle and this makes the shoe much more versatile which I'll get into later so for the all version is clean is minimal for aesthetics I'll definitely give it a solid 9 out of 10 next let's talk about its affordability you can find this for about 80 to 90 USD and in Singapore it retails for about 140 Singapore dollars I bought it for 100 Singapore dollars during Chinese New Year when there's a promotion so it is a steal for me but and 140 Singapore dollars I wouldn't say it's super affordable but considering that it is a pair of well-made shoe and it has really decent quality I would say most people can't afford it so for portability I'm gonna give it a 7 out of 10 mixed is is comfortability I'm not too worried about its comfort ability to be honest I mean it doesn't have any nike air max or adidas boost technology so I don't expect it to be super comfortable but it's decent it has a very standard insole and your feet wouldn't really get super tired when you wear this for the whole day the leather upper will get softer the more you wear them the comfortability is pretty comparable to the Chuck Taylors so for comfort ability nothing special pretty standard so I'm gonna give it a 6 out of 10 let's go on to durability as I said it has some pretty decent quality it has a leather apple and a rubber sole I really like mary has stitching's around the front half of the shoe to really make sure that the so stays strongly adhered to the upper a kind of which Congress did that overall if you look at the stitching's it is a very well constructed shoe and I hate to say this but I'm pretty sure it's gonna last longer than my converse converse you can step up your game speaking of durability I'm gonna talk about its maintenance since it's all White's you really have to clean it regularly to make sure that it is clean and fresh always because a dirty pair of shoes just looks bad and unstylish but since it's made of leather you can easily wipe off the dirt and the stains with a wet tissue or wet cloth so that's good but anyway for durability I'm gonna give it an 8 out of 10 pretty solid lastly its versatility is definitely the best for the summer you can wear it for spring and fall as well be somewhere for winter winter is for boots baby anyway this is definitely one of the most versatile pair sneakers even more versatile than the Chuck tailors in my opinion the Stan Smith is a little bit more classy so you could dress it up a little bit I like to wear this to a smart casual setting with a pair of chinos or trousers so he can really dress this up and dress it down so for versatility I'm gonna give this an 8 out of 10 so overall drumroll please I'm gonna give this an 8 out of 10 I'm really sick pair of speakers I really love them cannot wait to wear them more regularly I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking to buy a really nice and classic pair of sneakers which is very versatile as well it can be worn with any casual - smart casual outfits but just remember to clean it regularly and that is it for this week's video hope you find this review helpful if you like this video make sure to smash that thumbs up button subscribe if you haven't done so already and as always I will see you guys next week don't worry I still love you,2025-06-19 08:39:24.366197 UTC
zWVBeWuyZ4s,[Applause] hey what's up everybody welcome back to another shoe review and today I have the updated Stan Smith shoe in 2024 so you can see the box right here it says in plastic waist a traditional Adidas logo shoe boxes right here right there and this is a lifestyle shoe so it's a size 12 stand Smith this thing retail for $100 so yeah I got this at the outlet so yeah so I got it for a good deal so let's open up this the most iconic shoe you can get from the Adidas so where you can see and let's take it out nothing special it just says n plastic waist Globe right there very hard to see but yeah nothing special with the box of this shoe and this shoe speaks for itself so you look watch my other review of this shoe I had the navy blue one and I have like the vegan leather kind of uh stance smth so I'm going back to with the traditional uh leather type of um stance SMI and you can see the quality is not the same anymore I think the old one the quality is pretty good until they do the end plastic waist one I don't know because the Plastics mixing some kind of thing inside the shoe but yeah you can still see the the design you can see a little um circles on the bottom for traction with the Adidas logo right there and this is the lifestyle logo okay so St Smith say St Smith in the back and yeah St Smith the guy and he's famous for his tennis skills just like Michael Jordan is famous for his basketball shoes so we're saying right here endorsed by Stan Smith with his face right there and his signature so that's pretty cool I think the green one is the most classic one you could find and yeah this thing is expensive $100 they go up to $100 now so you can see this is size 12 us and yeah let's look at the insole of the shoe and they kind of glue it down really well but you can see it's just a foam shoe and it's really stuck in here the glue really well you can see this blue foam and if you're not used to the cushioning system uh or you guys used to the modern cushioning system uh they have Boost they have zumax zoom Nike Air Max if you're into like cushioning shoes this is not sh the shoe for you these for a reserve for people who are into the lifestyle no technology whatsoever in the shoe so yeah it's a lifestyle shoe and look at the shoe laes so I about the shoe is for the iconic look not for the performance so yeah it's pretty thick flat shoe lace right here with the flat tip and let me see if I can take the inso out of the shoe it doesn't feel like the classic one it feels like they mix the leather it's feel more plasticky now not as leathery like before and you can totally feel it and yeah so if you guys look at the Adidas right now now they got the shoe retail for $100 but right now it's on sale for $60 so that's pretty cool and it says it's like best seller on the website but the size are very limited you have small sizes but the larger size like me size 12 were pretty much gone so you want the Sho you have to go with some weird colorway like you can see right there it's kind of hard to get like the bigger SI size so everything's bigger size you can get a size 13 which is too big for me but yeah and yeah then Adidas change the shoe you know they try to be more sustainable save plastic and everything but this shoe have been around for like 15 years you believe that um very iconic and it's fresh um you know it's fresh no matter what you look good in white shoes and they these committed to um recycle polyester so they mix it with the vegan stuff so yeah the shoe is not the same and yeah but this is the only thing you can get now so you know not the same shoe as before but yeah I'm not complaining I'm just stating the fact but you can see the Stan Smith very iconic right there but yeah I really love this shoe so this is my third pair and compared with the other I iconic shoe which is the fast break Pro this is more of a por performance shoes than a lifestyle shoe because it's made for basketball and for skateboarding and I love how this shoe has this thick foam inso compared to the Adidas stmi let me try to take it out and show you guys look how thick the insole is compared to the Adidas you see that how thin this one is and how thick this one is look at that big size comparisons and yeah um if you stand for a long time if you work in the shoes you could probably be fatigued so I'll go with like um another insole more something with more polyurethane for the shoe so I'm going to put the shoe on and see how it looks like on my feet all right guys you saw on my feet um yeah the shoe uh doesn't feel the same but um it has the touch from the outside but the feel of putting the shoe on is still the same just like the Original Classic because of the same design and everything um yeah it's true to size the width is perfect so if you size 12 just go stick with your own size so you don't have to go half size up or down or anything um yeah I like the thick shoelaces and the iconic look but yeah um the traction is pretty good um this this used to be a tennis shoe I guess you can still play tennis with this but uh it's more of a lifestyle shoe now so yeah um of course you can do other stuff like going to gym walking exercise with it no problem at all the only thing is there's no cushioning system uh years ago I believe they had the Boost St Smith which I couldn't get which I really wanted but I couldn't uh the mid on the bottom is like boost so it's pretty good um too bad I didn't get it um that's my regret but yeah this shoe is um pretty good the the panel when you feel it's made with recycle um material so it's more vegan now so it's not leather anymore so these trying to move away from animal uh products and material so yeah the feel is not the same if you with the touch so if you like the original leather I think you just have to find an old pair and do a soul swap or something and uh yeah and uh the bottom is made with 50% um recycled content because adid is trying to end plastic Wass that's why it is and my last pair of um vegan Adidas this all this start cracking because I don't know why um I didn't wear it that much and I store it when I start wearing it started cracking on me so yeah which is too bad and the white shoe like this is easy to get dirty so what I um thing you guys should do is spray some clear protector for shoes just to protect your shoes from getting yellowing and getting dirt on there because I don't know how this thing will stain will affect the shoe cuz I know the leather one's pretty good with the stain but I don't know about the vegan so yeah and what you guys think of this shoe and this is the only thing we can get so yeah I can't go back to like the olden days where you get like premium product but uh yeah this is one of the best iconic shoe ever I really love it and this is my third pair and yeah I can't go wrong with it but yeah right now it's on sale so just go to Adidas and grab a pair or a Foot Locker or other shoe store that you like yeah so if you like my video please smash the like button if you haven't hit subscrib please hit the Subscribe button don't forget to hit the Bell icon to get future

AWphcGq4BVo,hey guys welcome back for the channel my name is Dorian this is Ashley hello hello today we're gonna talk about whether the adidas Stan Smith's are worth it yep so so we just get into it yeah I think so this is a new series for us we've done a couple other videos about it related to white sneakers as well so if you're interested in these you might want to check out the other one we'll link it below but ash I think we just get into it let's talk about the pros of the adidas Stan Smith's like what makes them so great why are they such a big big big part of all of the shoes you recommend if you're recommending a sneaker specifically a white sneaker it's always going to be these yep tell the audience without fail tell them what because price price comparison to the quality of the shoe that designed the shoe it's just it's unbeatable it's crazy inexpensive they're like what 80 it depends yeah it could be like 70 to 80 to 90 days you can find them on sale so the put the price is super super inexpensive under 100 bucks it's a pretty clean design it's all white pretty much and then you can also the back of it this is it all white this is the triple white but you can also get it in green blue they have like a Stephen King red a bunch of different colors that you can kind of just personalize it to your personality into your sense of style but it's a really clean silhouette slim profile round toe not too bulky not too slim so ass I think it's safe to say that pound per pound dollar for dollar these are gonna be the best value you're gonna find as far as white sneakers are concerned certainly there's cheaper options out there but they're gonna have downsides and the design and comfortability and wear and tear on them so really what are the downsides of Stan Smith specifically so I would say the downsides I mean it's pretty minimal but I think it's really important to find an essential item that has the cleanest design possible so I would my wishes are that obviously the perforated holes here which represent the three stripes for Adidas were gone I wish it was just cleaner um and I mean that's really it what has the name you're not a victim yeah it was the name wasn't stamped into the rubber sole I don't necessarily mind that it's on the back of the shoe and on the tongue of the shoe it's pretty minimal but I would say those are like my two biggest things it's it could be a cleaner design and I think that that's what you should always strive for when you have when you're filling your closets up a closet up with essential item closets mini all the closet fill them all one or two whatever so I would say that's the biggest downside it could be a cleaner design so comparatively ash how do they stack up against everybody else in the white sneaker space I guess is a way to describe it I mean you have your common projects which super clean design very minimal and then these fit into the more inexpensive versions the more fast fashion and so I would say they go they can go toe to toe with any of the more inexpensive white sneakers out there these are one of my favorite ones just because it's a it's one of the cleaner designs but sometimes with your white sneakers you want a little bit of uniqueness to it so if that's what you want if you want to if you're adding additional white sneakers to your closet then that's really great but I think that for your first here I love this dance myths I think you should go with them for your first pair it feels to me a little bit like you're implying that they're cheaply made and not quality no I'm asked fashion stuff let's get real it's not gonna last it's gonna look great for a couple of weeks and then it's not gonna do well hmmm forever21 white sneakers yeah so Stan Smith leather you've got the this whole leather upper you've got the white rubber it's a really really good shoe I've had mine for you yes you've had yours for years and I've had mine for years just give him a nice clean off every now and then or taking to a tennis a sneaker shoe cleaning place they'll look pretty damn close to as good as new I've done that two and three times at least with one of my pairs and they look great so that's not to imply that they're bad for the price actually I would say the value is really high like you get close to common projects level value out of these without paying common projects level pricing which i think is extremely good and the reason why I personally love and wear these all the time as well so you were implying a little bit that these were well why don't you ask me are they worth it that is the question that I need to answer and I will say 100% without reservation without hesitation they are definitely worth it I think that regardless if you can afford more in a more expensive sneaker or not you should have this sneaker in your shoe closet at the end of the day if you really just mess them up like you really get them dirty and you just worn them and like to the point where there is no no going back they can never look like new again guess what you can easily buy another pair and it's not gonna break the bank so that's why I think that you should definitely have them regardless if they're your first pair second pair third pair fourth pair definitely have these in your closet that's it I don't know what else to say alright guys thanks so much for watching we'll see you the next one bye,2025-06-19 08:39:24.665332 UTC
1fgb7uW-l4E,the Adidas Stan Smith sneaker is undoubtedly a forever classic even men who are not into style or fashion conscious know about this iconic shoe and probably have at least one pair in their sneaker rotation I've had my Stan Smiths for a bit over a year and a half now it's not an ordinary pair of Stan Smiths though it's the special edition Kermit the Frog design that dropped a little bit over a year ago and so in this comprehensive review I'm going to quickly touch on the Stan Smith history cover the style and design of the shoe quality and craftsmanship comfort and durability shoe sizing pros and cons and finally wrap it up with the price to Performance let's get started so for a quick history of the Adidas Stan Smith it goes back over 50 years and counting the shoe has its status as the very first leather tennis shoe with the most popular version of the Adidas Dan Smith being the OG Cloud white and green which debuted in 1965. originally named Adidas Robert Hill it after the brand endorsed the French tennis pro but in 1978 it was renamed named after Stan Smith an American tennis player Fresh Off winning the U.S open in 1971. now I'm not going to bore you with any more details of the history here so if you want a deeper dive on Adidas and the lore of the Stan Smiths you can go and check out the article on my blog now let's Jump Right In with the style and design of the sneaker so the Adidas Stan Smith is comprised of a white leather upper and soft cotton laces and it's a simple minimalist sneaker design the clear difference between the Stan Smith and other Adidas shoes is the lack of the three stripes angled across the shoe side instead there's three rows of these perforated ventilation holes on both sides there's sometimes a sketched picture of Stan Smith on the tongue of the shoe that says endorsed by Stan Smith with his signature in the case of my kermits the sketches prominently displayed in the same lime green color as the green on the back tab all in all the design and form of the shoe has basically stayed the same since it was a originally introduced but a myriad of new versions and colorways have appeared throughout the years so let's delve into more specifics of this special edition Kermit sneakers so my Kermit Stan Smith sneakers have an identical design to the current Stan Smith model but instead of the classic Kelly Green shade it's a much a lighter shade while I'm green almost neon green color and it's the same color as the Beloved Kermit the Frog for details you're going to find a sketch drawing of Kermit down in the right lower right hand corner of the shoe with Kermit all in caps angled in the middle of the upper between two of the perforated stripes with all of these small details it's not as minimal as a pair of plain stand Smiths but it pays homage to the equally as iconic Muppets character additional details to note are on the left shoe tongue you'll again find Kermit proudly displayed and finally the colored tab along the back of the shoe is the same lime green color but instead of the Stan Smith logo type the left shoe has printed it's not easy in quotes and the right shoe being green in quotes and it's an obvious playoff words calling out the color green and sustainability and of course the trefoil emblem is prominently displayed as well now on to the styling of the sneaker so the Adidas Stan Smith is a superb shoe to be worn casually which is no surprise since it was originally a sports shoe meant to be worn on the tennis courts with the connection to tennis the shoe naturally Vibes well with the preppy aesthetic think collared shirts or polo shirts for example here I'm rocking a super light fit for the warmer spring and summer climates with the light washed jeans heather gray PK polo shirt and round sunglasses simply put the Stan Smith's shine with simple outfits like this okay so if you want access to content that I don't share anywhere else be sure to subscribe to the Gent within newsletter where I'm going to send you a weekly dispatch on all things style self-development dating and confidence I'll have it linked down in the description so go ahead and sign up now back to the video so now let's get into the quality and craftsmanship of the Adidas Stan Smith so it's Stalin design is impeccable but it's the Adidas Stan Smith a well-built shoe let's find out leather upper so the Stan Smith's all leather upper is made with vegan alternatives to the animal derived ingredients with their Prime green which is their own proprietary high performance recycled materials so the leather is relatively soft and it's got a subtle pebbled texture when you're looking at it close up and it features a relaxed and flexible leather shoe tongue and a rounded toe box now for the lining and the insoles Adidas Stan Smith shoes they're lined with a thin half leather lining along the back of the shoe and a light synthetic fabric lining for the rest the insoles they're pretty soft cushioned and they display the Adidas and Disney logo along with the prime green lettering which likely means that the insole is made with recycled materials as opposed to synthetic like it used to be now for the outsoles shoes have a basic rubber outsole just like any other shoe around this price point nothing special like margam or anything like that the rubber is pretty grippy on all surfaces from concrete to wood flooring and it doesn't get all that doesn't get dirty all that easily too which is a plus and there's that Adidas a logo type and the trefoil leaves emblem printed along the side of the outsole and finally for the laces the laces are a soft cotton with a crisscross lacing system with plastic eyelets for added durability and now quickly the comfort and durability so how comfortable is the Adidas Stan Smith so in three words pretty damn comfy the fabric lining is just as soft as the leather lining and there's nothing inside of the shoe that causes discomfort even when wearing the shoe for long periods of time additionally I've worn them all day many times last summer when I was in Las Vegas just for fun and this year when I was traveling to Boise Idaho for a comfort friends and just casually wearing them all day so they've been holding up just fine the soles are still grippy and intact nothing's falling apart like with a pair of cheap shoes then you'd find at your department store and finally the shoes are pretty easy to clean you know you can simply use one of those Lysol wipes or a wet towel mix it with a dash of soap and you'll be good to go alternatively you can get those disposable shoe cleaner wipes for white leather suede or mesh from rejuvenator or simple shine you know they're convenient to use when you're in a pinch now onto the shoe sizing so I usually get size 8 sneakers for most brands and it's a pretty safe bet though there's always a small gap of excess room behind the ankle and so since Adidas offers half sizes I decided to go for seven and a half which usually fits me well too at seven and a half it's a perfect fit for me when I go either cyclists or I'm wearing thin no-show socks but with thicker wool socks for winter becomes slightly snug though not to the point that it's uncomfortable they do not offer wider sizes and so it could be a problem area for those with wider than normal feet my feet are normal though narrower shoes like The Kill Shot twos worn for lengthy periods of time can cause me a bit of discomfort these Stan Smiths however are comfortable worn all day they fit me normally like my Nike internationalists Nike Air Max and shoes from other well-known Brands like grates coyo Oliver Cabell evasia and Beckett seminar now let's get on to the price to Performance so in the current economic environment a pair of data Stan Smith retails on our website for under a hundred dollars at about 95 as of the moment the classic white cloud green colorway is on sale for 67 which is a price that you can find it at at various points throughout the year at the 67 price point this all leather sustainable sneaker is more than half the cost of some other entry to mid-level sneakers like the direct consumer favorite Becca Simon read which retails for 159 and it's more than three times cheaper than a pair of Oliver Cabello ones which are currently on sale for 1.99 they're even a good deal less expensive than affordable Thursday Premier low top sneakers which clocks in at about 129 and finally it retails about the same as the Wally popular Knight kill shot twos sold out on Nike's website again which is currently available on Amazon for 79 which is still more than the Stan Smith which is currently going for 67 on Amazon as well and so with a comfortable step a quality builds and a highly affordable price point this iconic sneaker punches well above its weight while graded on price to Performance so are the Adidas Stan Smith sustainable that's a commonly asked question so you've got to commend them Adidas they've been working towards making their shoes particularly the Stan Smiths with more sustainable materials today the Stan Smith is made with vegan alternatives to the animal derived ingredients or materials and is also made with that Prime Green Technology that I mentioned before which is a series of high performance recycled materials and the upper is made with 50 recycled content with no virgin polyester by 2024 Adidas said that they're committed to use only recycled polyester in all of their shoes which you know it's a great statement but let's hold them to it now some of the pros and cons of the sneakers so the Adidas Sam Smith is a renowned sneaker that is culturally relevant as it is the style icon it's available in over 30 colors on the Adidas website for ultimate versatility it's got a sharp and stylish silhouette it's sustainably made with an affordable price point and it's always in stock fill up what to purchase on their website and Amazon and now some of the cons you'll be following the crowd by wearing the sneaker and the special edition drops like this one sell out really fast and it can be hard to find in the resale Market alright so I've been wanting to put out this review together for a while now and it's always fun to write about products that have permeated the Fashions like Zeitgeist and our rooted in sports history like like kill shots and so you can check out another sneaker review right here or another video right here and so that's all I got for this one cheers to your style and I will catch you on the next one peace,2025-06-19 08:39:25.099616 UTC
VjMF68yxpKw,it's time to purchase a new adidas sneaker hello youtube and welcome to the site today we will be talking about these stan smiths that i kept in the trunk of my car for a year but more importantly these are very symbolic and i have a story to tell you about stan smith's so we will be doing that today also i promise this lines up today is my three year anniversary with taylor taylor and i basically have a standing appointment to hang out every single weekend and we have for basically three years straight and on thursday she dropped a curveball and said hey i'm going to buy pants in soho with my friend sasha you have something to do on saturday right and i was like yeah so i figured you and i could go get a pair of shoes and i told taylor i was like yeah i have a friend to hang out with too i'm gonna hang out with stan she was like stan do i know stan and i was like uh well you've been around him a lot he's been in the trunk of my car for a year but today is a story and taylor stiffed me dear taylor you suck all the negativity out of my life today i am wearing reebok club c85 shoes and i'm really getting into shoes and i made a video a few videos ago saying that i was becoming a minimalist that is still the plan i know it may seem odd but i i have a plan it's a really simple plan obviously right now this channel is all about reviewing stuff so i can't just not have stuff or i don't know what to post although as it gets warmer i want to do regular vlogs i cut this out of every single vlog that i do but i say it every single vlog what would the thoughts be if i just did a vlog on like new york city and not about clothes would you all hate that and unsubscribe anyways today i'm wearing reebok club c85s a lovely shoe compared to the stan smith so they are an okay shoe because the stan smiths are the greatest white sneaker of all time and they are very sim as i said they're very symbolic and they helped me become who i am okay so quick intro to the story i consider there to be two very distinct parts of my life bs before stan smith and a.s after stan smith my life didn't change because i got the shoes my life was changing when i got the shoes for a very specific reason but i need to go because taylor and i we do have a dinner date today at 6 30 and it's 1 37 so i should really get this kraken during the bs stage of my life i was very happy go lucky but like too happy-go-lucky like kind of crazy happy-go-lucky hey what's up guys it is mike and okay super nerdy but at the same time like super oblivious to the world and like ignored it so this story involves people it's on the past it doesn't matter everything's good we're very young and it's all okay so during the stage of my life i dressed in yu-gi-oh graphic t-shirts graphic t-shirts in general but that's the period of my life the best way to say this is i didn't have an identity yet at all i just kind of followed things i didn't like think about who i was or how i presented myself or anything like that that's what i'm trying to say our generation is going to be one of the coolest generations ever and while i was this gelatinous blob still i got into my first relationship my first real relationship and when you're in the relationship and you're still a gelatinous blob you think this is probably gonna be the person that i marry to be fair the other person is also a gelatinous club so really your relationship is just based off of what you've seen on tv you're not really thinking about it too much so it's a bit odd the relationship's going great everything's going according to plan we're planning our wedding date everyone's super excited i'm starting to find out that i like theater and improv and we are having a ton of fun together and we're having so much fun together that the person dating decides it would be probably even more fun if they dated someone else on the side and didn't tell me so i was a little pathetic i didn't really know what to do i wanted to stay together i was like we could fix this with that now if that ever happens it's kind of good but at the time i had no idea so what was interesting is that that relationship was a pretty long relationship and it kind of kept me as a little blob in a box and i didn't change at all and i didn't like look up or anything i just stayed my little blobby wobbly self until that event happened and it took a little bit but it did happen i was walking with my camera and this guy said take a picture of my trunk and i was like i don't really want to do that he's like no take a picture and i looked in the trunk it's just a single baseball cap so the situation itself just kind of sucked in general i found out in probably the most public setting you could and met the person as i found out so that sucked but what was weird is that at the time i never really like looked at anything i was wearing and like a few months after that happened i looked like in the metaphorical mirror and was like oh i think i need new shoes like now so i went to savers a thrift shop and i found a pair of stan smiths they didn't look like this at the time they look like basically someone bought them and then scraped them somehow and then immediately donated them so i got them for seven dollars and that was the first time i ever made a really conscious decision of i want these shoes because they are white tennis sneakers and i think they'll go well with a lot of my outfits and that marked really the first time that i started just to think i don't i don't know what i started to think i guess more autonomously like for myself and at the time my fashion change from like the graphic tees and cargo shorts and shoes tied too tight to like perfectly fitted trendy stuff i feel like that's the cycle you go in you don't think about how you dress then you go exactly trends and then you start to branch out and do what you like and i lost that kind of like hunky dory everything's amazing g willikers at that time i feel like i just became like an actual person with thoughts okay so i got the stan smiths the new ones but i am running it very close to when i have to meet taylor are you a lace to the top type person or are you leave the top eyelid open wasn't a good thing to happen but i do think it was the catalyst to a lot of things happening so i don't know maybe it was a good thing to happen it was to really say at the end of the day it's been so long and all that i really could absolutely care less now and if someone said if you can go back in time and not have that happen i would say nope i this is i'm too happy right now to risk that changing anything because i think if that didn't happen i would have confused happiness or fulfillment with contentment and that's not something i want to do because after that incident i i didn't like boyfriend girlfriend date anyone for a while but i did date a lot of people in the meantime and met a lot of people and found out like which i believe everybody finds out after you date the first person you're like oh every this isn't my old relationship was way different than this one and my next one was way different than those two and you kind of slowly begin to shape what you want in a relationship and you see that the first person you've been with or the second or the third isn't how every relationship is and you learn a lot more so i think either way bs michael would not exist i think something would have come along and taken the globby blobby me that's whistling and singing down the street and shaped them more to have an identity it just so happened to be this and i think it's probably the thing that has shaped me the most because there's a few other things but i think this is probably the biggest thing where i was like okay that's how life works but also obviously i've made a ton of mistakes while dating i wasn't the best person that i could have been a lot of the times and i think that's just kind of how it goes you learn from both sides of the coin and then get happier and meet someone and keep meeting people and then you find someone that kind of checks all the boxes and you hope it works out happy

FEWtuMI_tFI,"welcome back to Cape Critiquers everybody Today we are talking about the trial of the Incredible Hulk from 1989 Bill Bixby Lou Farerigno Yep Right off the bat I noticed that they just kept calling him [ __ ] David Belair the whole time because he see the whole premise of the show was that he just walked from town to town city to city and always had a madeup name because he was a man on the lamb cuz he was really accused of a murder Mhm as I remember in the beginnings of the uh thing So he assumed his own death and off he went So even on his tombstone though it's David Bruce Banner David Bruce Banner Yeah that's that was just a little bit I searched it up The the studio thought that he would sound too gay if his name was Bruce Banner That's what you're talking the 80s Yeah Not like maybe a little earlier right when when did the show The show was in the 80s 78 to 82 Yeah it was late Yeah late 70s 78 Yeah So like I don't know just different time I watched this show religiously I actually loved this show as a I mean if it's anything like this movie it's pretty decent show especially for the time And they would never admit that Yeah They only admitted that recently because comic book fans of course were saying but we always thought it was Bruce B Where did David come from and that was kind of the they gave whatever [ __ ] excuse It's just so Yeah I know It is what it is But it's just like okay but I grew up with that David Bruce Banner being you know I mean I knew Bruce from the comics from the TV show I mean I grew up like sort of with this with Bill Bixby was Does he ever like call himself Bruce at all or is it like only on the show never No never No He was always a mildmannered guy intelligent He was always the kind of actor that you you wished was your next door neighbor you know always had that very pleasant pleasantness about him And uh and then Lou Ferraro came along and actually was found the perfect acting role for him Ligno is [ __ ] huge He's I I don't know if he's 6'4 or 6'6 but the difference between him and Schwarzenegger Schwarzenegger was the bodybuilder so Schwarzenegger had all the cuts and and big man too but Fignno was a powerlifter Yeah So he was there to lift the five 600 lb And of course like you said he just looked like a big brick wall It's just in like actually insane to look that way Yeah But it's just so funny cuz after this and you know years later comes a uh a comedy show a sitcom comes and Lou Fargno plays a neighbor on uh Yeah No Yeah You want to hold Look looking back on this though the it's just so 70s 80s 90s style television It's just absolutely you know it's just amazing Honestly like for the most part I found it all pretty straightforwards and like easy to watch and like there's times when like it's like oh this is like actually pretty good And then I was saying to Jack there's times where it's like unintentionally like the funniest [ __ ] thing I've ever seen Just like the whole there's like a dream sequence in this where he's just tearing up this [ __ ] courtroom Well the name of the show is the trial of the Hulk but how are you going to put the Hulk on trial for real it had to be a dream sequence but they advertised this whole thing of him turning into the Hulk I remember this being advertised I didn't watch this show when it came out but I remember it cuz I was a big fan of the original show but then ' 89 I sort of aged out of that I guess that type of TV And um I I just I mean watch this just put me right back to the Incredible Hulk television show I watched the series and like you said you're talking 78 to 82 So I was 16 17 years old Again it's it's corny in its own way and they're limited to what special effects they could use Most of the practical stuff Yeah I thought like Hulk [ __ ] like throwing people around Great Yeah that that was marvelous A lot of the stuff that he breaks you could see almost that it's it's not real woody Yeah you can see But hey it worked for me back then I honestly thought it looked good even like when he busts out of the jail like that whole those uh well the way they did that that sequence when you heard the sound and then they show the broken wall and or the twisted bars or what have you I thought they did that pretty well in there For me it was interesting cuz at first you know the first time I saw him Hulk out I was like oh this is hilarious like what the [ __ ] is this um cuz I'm so used to the great what our Hulk our generational Hulk But then I I started thinking well what if I was a kid back in the 80s and I was seeing this i started thinking about it a little bit more and holy [ __ ] it was actually awesome It was awesome I mean they I even say they nailed like getting the shots of like the shirt ripping and the shoes expanding and the eyes turning was cool I think this is like Eric Bayana like said this is like a major reason he wanted to play Hulk So yeah I mean I thought he did a good job as the Hulk That was just an oddly directed version of that I don't remember anything from that other than [ __ ] wolves that get progressively bigger Hulk wolves by um the Asian director Yeah The guy who did Brokeback Mountain Yeah Yeah I I really like the transition from like in the dream sequence when it turns to Matt like [ __ ] hammering you must do this or whatever Just answer the question Yeah Just the like lawyer or whatever in court I don't know Just an interesting cut there Mhm Another one You said it but uh it's another one just shot really well Yeah Where like I I just was not focusing on the story at all You know I I have like four [ __ ] notes here I mean the the story probably isn't too far off of like a 70s to 80s Daredevil And this is like a twoshot comic probably Um but I sent you one where it's just Kingpin like sitting like that and he has his [ __ ] mirror glasses and you can just see the reflection of the screens I wonder why they went with the dwarf kingpin I Well I didn't even really notice that I I was just more so interested that he was like a man in the chair Yeah Mhm Well you're saying the actor to play him Yeah Well he's not like a dwarf in real life No no no But I just had a cl Why they didn't go with the the the big kingpin You guys know him better from that I know him as Sal from Indie Indiana Jones Oh yeah I mean I I thought he was actually pretty good in this He's like definitely he was actually pretty good in it His motiv his motivation is kind of funny when you just think that he's like if I [ __ ] show people I've beat up Daredevil they'll give me a big company but he actually played like a true like eccentric kingpin I thought he did pretty well Yeah he was definitely like the cool king I don't know Like he was just the guy in the chair for me the guy felt like he literally was in the chair telling the guys exactly what to do Like kind of like not a bad kingpin though Yeah I don't It's interesting to do that But I don't know It's weird Like he's looking at the screen He's like ah how nice Like what are you going to do for the rest of your life 24 hours Also the [ __ ] one part [ __ ] like so funny The one part where he's like I want a big screen right here So he he got the essence of the kingpin Yeah Yeah without the physical attributes of the comic book kingdom He is kind of big Yeah I didn't honestly notice that Yeah the hair slick back 80s style Like something about the beard really threw me off about Kingdom and it's like the Oakley glasses Yeah the glasses are weird but like they were big back but they were big back that was like cool glasses back then you know so you have to remember it sort of did age you know It's funny when we do this We remember it first runner We live through it Exactly This is like kind of pre uh I I do think the glass is like made for cool looking shots but it's just like funny to think about you know you have to remember like going back to the TV show itself towards the end of it like the Hulk had interactions I think with Sasquatch Was it him or was it the $6 million man the $6 million man did like they did some weird things on this show and he interacted with Thor I know that Yeah that's right Thor he had an interaction with Thor on this show The comic where Hulk meets Wolverine Isn't that Sas Saskatch or Yeti or something the Wendo Is it the Windo yeah I think It's right up there But like it's not [ __ ] Native American lore accurate Windendo at all Just like that monster Yeah it just is a Sasquatch pretty much Sasquatch Sasquatch He's No he's he's he's pretty supernatural Well I'm just saying like it doesn't look like a windo at all but doesn't [ __ ] have horns or anything [ __ ] furry monster Yeah Well that he's like also like a relatively big Wolverine villain now Yeah One of like honestly there's like a female Wendo or like Wendigo researcher that he's like a love interest and then like she becomes the Wendo in front of him and she Yeah I kind of like vaguely know what you're talking anyway I thought the Daredevil action was pretty good Yeah I did too And like actually kind of good way of showing his powers I thought a little bit overdone but like in theory interesting I guess Kind of cool cuz like I mean like how else do you show sonar in the [ __ ] ' 90s or '8s even yeah Even just the idea of actual [ __ ] loring him into this place and then just like blaring this [ __ ] sound into his ears But they didn't know that he was blind They didn't know anything about Yeah that was weird I mean like weird I guess he is always like ""Oh that's [ __ ] too that gun's too loud to me or that knife."" So like it's not It can't be the least obvious thing You're I don't like the sound of your knife [ __ ] just yelling at Turk Yeah I thought it was funny that they had Turk in it and he's not black Yeah cuz he is in the comics I It just probably is one of those things where it's like this is a character we don't even give a [ __ ] about Doesn't matter what we did make him Turkish No that he really wasn't notable in any way He look more Irish I don't know [ __ ] the scene where Kingpin like has the glasses full of diamonds instead of champagne and there's just like [ __ ] you can just see like for like 10 seconds just a guy like pouring the diamond pocket I was thinking like that's going to [ __ ] fall out and go everywhere It's a [ __ ] like I guess this is what I'm doing during the scene Yeah cuz nobody else did it Just Yeah he just kept [ __ ] like pouring him in [ __ ] Fisk escaping on a fantastic car Oh my god That was like the [ __ ] last thing I expected to happen And it just took off so slowly and then like the Daredevil's like right in front of it and he's just like you're going to pay like is this like the last thing in the Incredible Hulk show universe cuz like it just probably then just [ __ ] fisk escaping They should have made a Daredevil show I like feel like that would have done well back then Yeah probably I mean like most probably would When was the Captain America movie that we watched uh 90 Yeah So this is a year after This isn't that isn't the first Captain America movie by the way Yeah There was like an 80s TV movie cuz they were trying to do the same thing Two of them actually I don't feel good Could you pull over twice yeah I still can't believe that the fact that that came out a year after this and like this is just so much better Yeah H I mean like it look I I'll rewatch Captain America before this really for sure It just [ __ ] like I I'll get more laughter out of it [ __ ] I don't there is like funny sequences in this just like insane [ __ ] [ __ ] that happens Nothing will beat Captain America's transformation sequence when it's 90 shots in 2 seconds I was kind of I was kind of getting like that during the part when he like first transforms into the Hulk on the train and just like this woman [ __ ] punches like the guy's arm and then she he just shoots a [ __ ] random old person out of the train and then like the doors blow off because he punches the guy halfway across the [ __ ] subway It's insane I I did like the camp elements of this I guess but also just like you just got this [ __ ] guy like who was about to rape that woman I guess just [ __ ] like why would Kingpin ever hire him type thing that that guy and then like he was just like still a part of the team and then like went to do it again and then just like [ __ ] Germa that was there that just like sometimes I do good Yeah he goes to like hit uh [ __ ] the Hulk but not like the David not Bruce Banner over the head with a pot and just bashes the guy and I don't even [ __ ] know what that whole thing was about Yeah the redemption arc from the assistant was weird And then he just went with him in the end anyway Yeah they don't Did he Yeah he was flying the the car I almost like What they don't tell you is that he crashed in on purpose First time we saw the assistant guy it was almost like [ __ ] implied that they were like gay lovers cuz like hey yeah go into the bedroom or whatever He was like ""Are you sleeping 7 hours a night?"" Yeah I don't know It It was weird Like something about sleep [ __ ] go to bed or whatever I don't know I think he wanted him to to rest that he would be well rested It's just funny that they all live in the same building I guess Yeah And then like something weird at the end when they're like ""Yeah the building's shorter."" It's like ""Yeah the the voltage box."" No I don't know The thing that the car was in Yeah but it was like a fake voltage box No it was a big part It looked like a part of a building but like high voltage Yeah it was it almost looked like electrical [ __ ] was going on in there I don't know That was weird to me too That you would even like really hotel used to have the greatest view in the city than a Yeah skyscraper [ __ ] rundown hotel that he's still paying for Slept in it once maybe Not even Didn't even sleep there honestly Yeah you might be right Used to have the greatest view in the city The one thing that I always wondered about him though is like this this is a guy who has a small bag on his back no money except for what he's making I think and he's tearing out of his clothes every at least twice in an episode Where's he getting all these new clothes these brand new sneakers and everything else i'm still lost at the beginning why that random guy threw him into the mud He was just picking on him Yeah I didn't get that scene either Kept like throwing him down He's going to bash him with a shovel and then come on come on And then walked away That was that And that was enough for him to be like I'm not staying here I'm going to the the city Yeah Weird I don't know why he would go to the city cuz that's like dangerous He was like ""I can't [ __ ] be near people."" Yeah Yeah That's even worse So let's go to a place where they're compacted into a small concrete area and where people can be [ __ ] to you constantly Yeah And get me angry Does he ever wouldn't like me when I'm angry in the show does he ever like go to like just the wilderness to live like has he ever tried that cuz I'm pretty sure that's like a thing in the comics Not that I remember No No Not that I remember I think that's when he meets the Wendigo is like he's in Alaska or some [ __ ] Maybe not Alaska Canada Yeah Wolverine Yeah of course You know at the end of this they almost made it like a cliffhanger like he was going to come back cuz now I I'm my doctor I still have it You have a brother I have a brother Brother now But and then it just I guess it didn't have such great ratings and uh going to come up with a actually interesting that they made the connection between like Matt's like radiation accident even though like I think that's a redcon in the comics but still I actually didn't like that that he got the same he got his powers from Bruce Banner's toxic waste Well I don't think it was the same toxic waste [ __ ] when he like checks out his eyes and he's just like immediately no you're blind forever I thought that was funny He's not coming back So why be able to see you no No 5 seconds Like I'm a doctor Just like Okay Also like I don't think he's not like a medical doctor No he's like a [ __ ] Yeah He has like a doctorate in [ __ ] nuclear physics and nine other things [ __ ] gamma radiation Yeah Blind forever Hulk his beard goes away I don't know I I didn't I did not put down a favorite least favorite Yeah I I think you got to especially when the series was running late 70s early 80s most of the stuff people were watching on TV had very little to do with making sure there was quality story Yeah It was what can we put on the screen to keep people's attention And and it worked 90% of the time just to keep people interested Story-wise like you could always look back and go ""Oh [ __ ] horrible story."" But back then entertainment was entertainment I honestly feel like it was kind of just like fine right like this one Maybe not I haven't seen every episode of the show Yeah And you're going to find stinkers on everything There's probably one where it's like he's got to fight like a [ __ ] gargoyle man or something There's just problems everywhere he goes He just never has a good day But like even like you said like the idea of just being like the trial of the Incredible Hulk back then [ __ ] watch it Right Exactly Nothing to do on whatever Friday night or whenever they showed it Exactly Um TV was interesting Yeah And like I said you had Bill Bixby who was like a fan favorite Always had that that essence about him you know And Fargno big man Oh yeah big man Let's see what he can destroy this week Yeah An actual giant human And then I thought um I think it's Rex Smith Great as like Matt Murdoch Daredevil Weird that like they wouldn't just name the like assistants [ __ ] Foggy and Karen Yeah No I have no idea if like they're supposed to be anybody because they were like pretty hyper specific about the the guy being like a former like like a war veteran Yeah I don't know I also had a question When Matt Murdoch gets out of his apartment and he's walking to the cab how do they did they do this i don't know if they do this in like real life I understand like the cab driver helped them Yeah Like grabbed them and then just basically walked them to the Well it almost seemed like they had a some type of agree like an arrangement or something where he picked them up every day So maybe that was part of the Sometimes they still do that Yeah Nowadays when uh like my disabled people call for accessoride or something Yeah Yeah Yeah They'll pull up get out and make sure they Nowadays most of them are rotten rotting up If you can't get in [ __ ] you Pay me anyway Also did you guys catch the Stan Lee cameo i did See it was in the courtroom That was cold God he was young Yeah he looked good I don't know I watched this at four times speed You missed the jury Um Oh just like the Speaking of the jury like this guy just [ __ ] watched uh the courtroom officer get launched across the room and then takes it upon himself to just [ __ ] launch a chair at the whole and missed completely Totally missed And then just like ran away like what the [ __ ] are we doing funny like oh my god But how many times have Lofig know that's like 90% of the paycheck But the thing is like this is all just a dream Like he's putting into his own dream That's a good point [ __ ] getting like sprayed Yeah Pepper sprayed I Yeah like this I it it wasn't bad It wasn't a bad watch at all I enjoyed it And like I said I probably watched a semi bad Daredevil show with this guy Do we do we have a favorites and least favorite scenes i don't know Not really My favorite's probably the courtroom or honestly like the jewelry heist I thought was really well sequenced That was well Yes that was interesting And that's when you got the first thing of the man in the chair you know They actually did that pretty well though you I mean it's just also just interesting like the tech they used just [ __ ] like speaker phones I don't know [ __ ] better heist than we got in Born Again Um least favorite scene is definitely that car taking off at the end It was just going so slow I wanted to push it Yeah I think I was just too like bewildered to even just driving through the the city What about when like Daredevil's like talking about his relationship with the sheriff or whatever and it's just like such a funny scene in a meeting and he's just like I don't know It's weird Yeah I like I was I watched that and I was like ""Okay so that's how he remembered it going cuz you can't see."" Like oh boy Yeah Like he just knew in that moment He didn't [ __ ] think he was getting mugged He knew that he called out a man to become the Daredevil So forget it I mean what it's going to be one of the 15 also insane [ __ ] thing for a sheriff to say Mhm Yeah Yeah That was [ __ ] inciting Just like a a vigilante essentially But like even when I don't I guess think about that part of it too much The underground corruption elements of this were actually like pretty interesting and done well Like Kingpin has the doctors He's got just everybody kind of in the palm of his hand The doctor coming in with the uh needle the whole thing And then he comes out of just behind the curtain in the room That's another moment for me that was close to Cap where it [ __ ] pushes this woman into something and just blows up the like whoa And when she's just trying to insert an air bubble I guess there was nothing I thought she was going to put something in her neck There was nothing in the syringe I think it was just supposed to be an air bubble that will kill you Yeah She tried to kill me and he saved me Daredevil Yeah This lady the other doctor or whatever it was Yeah kicked across the [ __ ] room too Um his suit looked good Daredevil suit It was It's the black suit Ly I don't think it's like ever used in the comics I mean it's the black suit Like not I don't think it's a homemade black suit I mean like I think that's really only a thing from the shows Black yellow and red but it's like the one from the Daredevil the Netflix show and like he has the thing tied around his head Yeah Yeah We have them right here You can open them up Oh look what one he's wearing Well anyways moving on I don't know It's almost just kind of like a weird Black Panther suit to me Yeah I thought he just went to a party city just bought one of those like fully colors Yeah And just got a like one of those night cap things that you put on a black version Just did that and that's it It's pretty much what it is Exactly what they did Yeah I don't know I thought it looked cool It worked It worked We have to stay within budget Yeah Uh what are we going to rate this one i don't know It's four three Really i don't know Yeah For what it is I'll give it a five I mean like the cinematography was fine but honestly going with like a six I was even maybe thinking like six and a half but I'm pretty content with a six Also like I feel like most of why I like the cinematography is just cuz like it's a thinner aspect ratio so like you got to fit more on screen I guess Just makes it you got to think about it Yeah I don't know I I felt like for the most part it was well sequenced and pretty straightforward as far as what it was trying to do I mean obviously there's some like corny and just silly elements but we're also talking about a man that turns into a big green [ __ ] monster So and 36 years ago Yeah Right So I thought it was pretty good Six Seven I'll give it a seven Okay Nice Enjoyed it I'm in the five area myself but that's okay Yeah You know but it was it was television back then you know i think like Jack said you're going to get more entertainment on a rewatch out of like a cap 1990 But as far as like really trying to make something I feel like this one is closer to being an actual movie That was our review of The Trial of the Incredible Hulk Next week on Cape Critiquers we have Superman and the Molemen from 1951 Nice That's before my time You believe a man can fly maybe And also happy birthday AJ Yay Let's do the birthday Do the birthday Happy birthday Mr AJ And

RDES7MHCQjc,what's the deal with the new Vel Smiths how do they stack up to the velas and what does some guy on the internet think about these I'm Dustin Klein Cadence collection founder and former cycling product designer here to give you my honest opinion on the new Adida Stan Smith Vell I am glad to see Aida's continued commitment to cycling Footwear respect this shoe has some interesting Design Elements but first let's talk about the use case this category of Footwear thrives in the city I like to call it performance commuter pruter conformance it's the perfect blend of style and function you could ride cross town efficiently while at the same time not looking like a complete bike dork after you get to your destination it's brilliant and it took people a long time to figure out the stylistic and cultural icons of this category are the bike messenger were you ever a bike messenger which brings me to the silhouette the Stan Smith iconic shoe classic colorway it makes sense but most of the messengers I knew either ran sambas which they've got covered or the superstars so both of those are very City Centric shoes the Stan Smith just feels a little country club plus this is very white have you ever ridden a bike it's filthy it's like one step cleaner than digging a trench with that said these are still cool full grain leather same silhouette as the original the tongue has just a little bit of padding some elastic on either sides to keep it properly in the middle plus this cool elastic lace saver is just a nice touch it's helpful and I suspect a vegan version of this coming down the line it's exactly what they did with the Vel Samba a couple interesting notable details the gold foil stamp on the tongue of Stan Smith riding a bike that's a cool touch if you're into the cycling Footwear feel free to subscribe it's completely free and fits even better than this shoe thing that makes this and the veloma so special is the integrated nylon insole which stiffens up the shoe making it ideal for cycling plus there's a knockout for two bolt C compatibility it's awesome now the reinforced nylon insole has some texture and horizontal lines which I'm assuming are to help cleat placement on the shoe which is a nice touch it doesn't hurt it shows they care fit I'm a US1 and these come in for me true to size as a US1 something that's kind of interesting about these you can absolutely run them with a cleat they work great with clipless pedals but if you don't have clipless pedals you only do flat pedals or toe cages you don't don't have to put cleats on these for these to be beneficial that nylon outsole does a lot for helping you on the bike and if you're going to run a cleat on these walking around is pretty good you're not grinding that cleat on the ground like you do on more of a performance cycling shoe they they strike a good balance and honestly they're not even that heavy with these and the velosa there is a bit of a Breakin period they're a stiff shoe which is what we want but they get even better if you stick with it you know I think the stand Smiths are just a little bit more comfortable I personally like the look of the Vel Samba although I'd have to say the Comfort lies in the Vel stand I'm curious for you which way do you go style or Comfort when it comes to Footwear I've been wearing these for last week and ultimately I'm impressed on the bike they're fantastic and when you're walking around they're a little weird at first to get used to but you adjust and then you kind of they just feel normal I mean they are a cycling performance shoe so if you're doing a lot of walking maybe not the best but if your life is a balance of the two you'd be fine like if you worked at a bike shop rode to work worked at the bike shop all day and rode home you could absolutely wear these all day well this is a cool detail I just realized this middle section on the back of the shoe is reflective ultimately there's not much I would change about this shoe which is great I think I would prefer it to be a superstar or come in Black whichever comes first if you're curious about their gravel shoe a more performance shoe you should check out this video but if you'd like to know that much more about the Vel Samba I got you covered that's right here yeah ultimately I think the velos samb is my pick just cuz I like the way it looks that's just me,2025-06-19 08:39:27.138947 UTC
uW-OsKpQncM,YouTube what is that what y'all today this isn't he'll be a fella this is Neoga fella good fella Neil coming through guys had a brain fart brain hiccup only reason why I said my name front were some backwards like that is because it was supposed to be just like how my channel is good fella Neil basically that's me on IG button on Twitter I end up putting my name in Reverse because I end up something end up happening to my original account good felony oh man so I ended up coming up with Neoga feller so every time I say good fella now when uh you know when YouTube you know above a block y'all get it plus - I'm just a good fellow man not like mob but excuse me guys not like mob but you know what I mean just so I got a pair of kicks today guys oh man where do I get these from adidas itself that whole April deal where you can put in the April code and then get 20 or 30% off definitely worth it to me I think damn yeah already been walking around in these though cuz y'all know how I like to do it man I like to I like to walk around the kicks are give you guys a better review and you know I like seeing a kid kicks crispy white or whatever y'all know me man I don't beat my kicks or anything but you know the the bottoms are do got the dirt now but when I first got him it was crispy clean all white but more into this though this is not like the first review of the Stan Smith or whatever so that's my kick I got right here and the color right here I know it get kind of funny you know obviously it's white and it's lush red and reason why I'm saying the actual exact red because they got a scarlet and they got a varsity red or something like that too so with my Stan Smith I end up I suggest going at least a half size down minimum because they do fit kind of big I'm gonna just say this whatever you wearing adidas superstar to that's what you should get for the Stan Smith personally I like a snug fit this sneaker is one of old school sneakers that that that fit kind of like big and that's from back in the day you know this kind of like oversized in a way so you know it's definitely essential to get your size easily one of the top of tennis sneakers of the summer and spring and stuff like that I'm gonna try to get a countdown out for you guys though I might do a small spring um and then do the summer one separate cuz me I like the way different colors hitting off that stuff you know what I mean so yeah that's how I feel about it but y'all know how I do man if you're already building this channel and stuff got two of my life so in a day so that's why I was looking like extra bright white but imma hold this up to the camera so you guys can see the full blown detail but um y'all know what I do man imma just go over brief review overview of the sneaker as far as the materials and what I think and then you know we could talk a little bit about it afterwards you know I'm making my two cents this one shouldn't be too much longer because this is like an instant classic there's a no-brainer a lot of original ones you know got the gremlin but they got so many different colorways now they got the royal blue navy blue everything man so they even swapped out the sold on the field actually put boost at the Bible of a few of them or whatever if you can actually find them in they have the velcro one they just like ramada five this shoe a lot if you can't find those so first thing first just for the people in my channel you got those throwback cotton laces now this is not the typical lace that we're used to this is like that throwback 70s 80s kind of like based lace and I think these came out in the 70s or the 80s don't quote me on that guys I only just looked up a little bit about it there's not that much information you know a lot of you know a lot of blogs is real basic or whatever they just say oh yeah get these adidas that's coming out they white and red here guy was on one foot and that's basically and maybe I saw what people are into but since I'm were so like the history of a sneaker and the reasons why you know what I mean the cultural significance and the difference and the progression or we made them create this stuff you know so I I personally like that kind of like stuff but uh so of course you got to endorse by Stan Smith and I always think about the Stan Smith from American Dad - I know they made a version with him as well so yeah I don't know if you can actually see that but yeah this is face right there and that lush red and then going to the leather right here you got like a tumble leather it's not like super premium but it's good enough that like if you wear this leather long enough it will break it and be nice and plush and in due time with this kind of sneaker fellas one of the things that really happened with these kind of sneakers especially these older sneakers like this is that this this will actually start to lemonade down here this minute so we actually started yellowing I welcome to character with fly colors guys I mean it makes the sneaker look more better I like that vintage look you know long as we just keep the uppers clean I know some people can't stand it you know they want to see that crispy white to each's own but I like that crispy off-white eggnog colorway with a clean up or two so it could give us some character man nothing's more better than character on it most cakes not all not all some of them do look hideous once the characters start coming in I say like something like the Concours I know those get like yellow in the mesh park and I know a lot of people they do look kind of you know like they've been pistol in a little bit or somebody spilled lemonade on them but it's quite possible that those can aged okay if they start the hill with just a little bit but other nectow like older sneakers like this though look beautiful once they start they look beautiful now with the all-white but you know once they start aging it's gonna really look fly going to the inside those on the end so we do got the lush red as well obviously you guys could see you got a clean tic-tac white toe box preparations on the side obviously to the back you got that leather Stan Smith and that's basically it going to the bottom of the soul you don't have too much traction now I've read up about this as well and you also got the that embossed or engraved adidas with the trefoil side now I've also read up about this being tennis sneakers as well probably for the 70s and 80s obviously looking at these because the tech is not that advanced on this one compared to later retros the sneakers late 80s 90s and stuff like that going to the inside though you do got like a leather sock liner this is one of those everybody sneakers like the sneaker kind like the converse allstar joints like the adidas superstar twos almost damn near is this sneakers almost about as common as a canvas sneaker so and this is where I feel like the Jordan one is gonna be if they keep pumping out the colorways eventually it's just gonna be that standard household name sneaker now everybody know what the Jordan Whitney is now but like with them coming out with all these crazy colorways it's gonna get down like this you know I don't want to say watery in a bad way but not water down in a bad way but it's gonna be no no but not too much else though guys do got the size on the back and do got my adidas superstar 2 right here just as not necessarily a too much of a comparison because I got these some time ago years ago probably in the early 2010's barolay Steve's or my sneaker Channel when this channel rather and yeah and that's probably one of my this probably one of my most popular videos and be bar lacing I have to turn the comments off on that because some people that can't bar lace or they you know they can't do it they you know they get pissed off and start up to you know start messing up the video you know what I mean they get mad after you know they get mad at they get mad at me for no reason it's like I'm teaching them how to do something you know trying to help but anyway as far as comparisons go as far as the leather quality the leather quality when the Stan Smith feels better than an adidas superstar she'll toe joints these are classic and as you can see at one point they were all yellow and cameras probably looking all yellow but when you actually see these in person Mies in particular are starting to get off-white welcome to color but the only thing about this I actually got these in a size 10 instead of a size 9 so I don't know guys might be up on the chopping block soon I like the sneaker it's just that sometimes it's just a it fits a little too too boxy long like you know because this older sneaker with like that old mold from like the pink to 80s the whole Run DMC I honestly think about with this so so yet so these sneakers are damn near the same but as far as like weight and everything this is a little bit more lighter and this is a little bit more heavier obviously I think people actually use the hoop in these and these obviously with these being tennis sneakers it's a little bit more light footed you can almost run in them and as far as comfort guys before I get up out of here the comfort when these are actually pretty decent straight out the box I'll probably give up oh wow seven and a half to eight I know right kind of high for the older sneaker but they didn't pump the tech up with this or you know the quality in this is definitely there as far as cushion I don't really too much have the aches and pains or anything walking around in this I've only walked in these for maybe like a few days but the break-in time I think was they breaking it gonna get a lot more comfortable and getting more emotive to the foot as far as rating I give these two just overall rate in as far as like being classic 10 being like the highest of 1 being the lowest out of 10 I'll give these because I think I'm I like them even more in time which they break in out of 10 I give them a solid solid 9 this is one of sneakers that you can actually wear with a little bit of everything dressing up dressing down whatever whatever even shorts if you want to go that route you this is one of everybody kind of like sneakers again like I said you could wear some prep clothing and still pull these off it's not like a big chunky boxy sneaker obviously you guys can see but this lower cut there's more low subtle cut a place that doesn't even really too much allow like sneakers all like that like as far as like a corporate environment now I'm not talking about soups or everything but I'm saying like more so like a casual environment you don't want to you know you probably don't want to wear a high tops or nothing like that but these are more Soto and more like low key so expect to see these on like one of my list soon but uh definitely worth it for the dollars you know you can always get these for a little less than $60 $50 $40 sometimes 30 if you can find a deal these too much never go over like a hundred unless there's something special in them or something but yeah so again you could wear this low you know low key prep casual I know the PO prep thing not in right now but uh if you dress up for work for those people that are still going to work around this time you know and you're allowed to actually wear casual clothing or whatever this is definitely be a nice pickup comfort level is there you won't have to kick these joints off you you know in case you got to walk around the office not the biggest deal you can go to the water cooler all that and come right back and everything could be fine man you won't be in pain so I remember I were somewhat um Bose at one time when I was working a corporate at one point not to get in trouble or anything but when wearing a sneaker like this versus of my Tumbo you know you know that sneaker is a big you know it's a hot top that you know that's heavy rather I'm gonna just say that it's more so heavy so tell me what you guys think all day classic the classics are still out there fellas you can steal Venessa deal Vanessa fit all that stuff guys different colorways so don't just subject yourself to only just one you might want to pick up multiple pairs regular people that's not sneakerheads also like these as well definitely a nice pair of clean kicks you know this go up there with bands converses adidas superstars those timeless odor kicks that's just really not gonna go nowhere because they're already staples and regular people Footwear in their closets and stuff like that so enough of my rambling guys rate comment subscribe I like to thank everybody's been watching my videos and you've been watching this to the end we're coming to subscribe I'm out peace,2025-06-19 08:39:27.397999 UTC
b-BeHYmiNfk,hey what's going on youtube today i'm gonna be giving some reasons on why i think you should cop a pair of stan smith we're also gonna be doing a review of the stan smiths that i've had for two years it's coming up on like three but yeah doing a quick little two-year review with that being said let's get the culprit out here let me take them all i have them on my shoe let me take them off so here they are i know i know they're pretty beat and i definitely abuse these look at me like that don't mind all right so now that we've gotten the uh the old boys out here let's uh let's take a look at the new yeah nice crispy adidas box brand new pair i mean there's nothing better than a brand new pair of shoes look at that difference what a difference two years makes this is me before kovit and this is me after coving you know first thing i want to talk about with these ones is pretty much the durability so the durability has surprisingly been pretty good especially after two years the upper has held up pretty well of course we got some blemishes in the front and then some scuffs around the upper but overall definitely pretty good the leather kind of has the leather on this one it's not the best i started to peel a little bit in the front and the leather has started to kind of crack by some of these holes she's also got a little bit of wrinkles you know she she's showing her age but overall not too bad onto the lining the lining is also held up pretty well normally normally especially with like canvas shoes that have like the canvas lining after you know two years at least for me anyways the lining will usually start to rip but that was it wasn't the case with these shoes so i'm really happy with that and that obviously because of the leather lining so it hasn't worn down at all same with the insert the insert has not worn down still the same old insert it's a little bit dirty but it hasn't really worn down or broken down as is the case with other shoes so overall pretty good on the inside as well on to the outsole the treading in the common areas has obviously started to fade a bit like on the heel and on the toe area the yellowing on the sole hasn't really been that severe either i've seen other people's pairs and their pair tends to yellow really really badly i'm not too sure why mine hasn't yellow that bad i mean maybe maybe it has yellow i was texting me i don't have any friends or else i wouldn't be doing this it was my mom it's time to go eat why am i housing over that maybe maybe it it has and it's just so damn very you can't tell but but overall outsole has held up pretty well let's talk about the comfort with these so with the comfort wise they really just have this insert it's this eba foam it is really thick though which is really nice i really like that and then on the bottom we just have kind of a fiber board and then a and then it's just a rubber on the bottom the comfort has been good on the shoes i really can't complain too much on the comfort even though it doesn't have any crazy midsole like a like a you know eva midsole they're still very comfortable just because that insert is so thick so yeah comfort definitely good no problems at all with comfort next reason why i think you should get a pair of stan smith it's because they're so they're just so damn versatile the shoe is versatile and then the outfits you can wear with these are versatile the shoe they come in tons of different color ways and tons of different like graphics on them you know adidas is always coming out with like a brand new different pair of sand smiths that you could buy i got the uh og colorway they're also versatile in terms of like what type of technology they use a couple years ago they released a lot of the boost version of the adidas there's ones that have the boost outsole someone had the primary upper and then they released a version that had both so really versatile in terms of like what adidas does with these shoes and what type of technology they incorporate into the shoes so yeah they do a lot of crazy things with these even some not so great things like the adidas slip-ons that just why why adidas why why did we need a stan smith slip on uh let's not talk about this same with the super stance what was up with that just absolutely horrible that shoe looks like it was built in a lab by some crazy mad scientist and you know they created a freaking frankenshoe with the super stamp and now it goes around haunting little kids who just wanted a superstar imagine being a kid who just wanted a pair of superstars and then your parents come at you they say hey little timmy here's your present little timmy opens up the box and this ungodly contraption of the super stand comes out you know how terrifying that would be those shoes are horrible on the tongue they freaking used they overlapped the logos on the tongue they freaking they painted the toe cap to make it look like you know they peeled the shell toe off they painted stripes on it it's a stan smith that's dressed up like a superstar it's just horrible i don't know why they would do that i have a theory that they just got some leftover stan smith and then maybe a couple superstars and they're like you know what you know what super stan and then they just combined the things and they just kind of painted it uh let's not talk about the shoe i went off on a crazy engine also in terms of versatility just style-wise right you can wear these with anything i like wearing mine with a pair of jeans you know they also look good in pairs of shorts of course you know on youtube you can see people wearing these with all type of outfits and they're rocking them and they look dope and because you have so many options in terms of different colors and stuff like that your options are basically limitless let's move on to the next point or the reason why i think you should copy pair the history these shoes have such a cool history like if you learn what's behind the face and what went into the design i think it's really cool and i'll give you a new appreciation on the shoe it's kind of like owning a little piece of history i'm not going to go into so much detail about the history of the shoes if you really want to dig into the history of the shoes definitely check out uh nacho average finds video on the stan smith there's a ton of other videos on the history of sneakers so definitely go check that out i'm just gonna mention some of the cool things i i found out about the history that i really liked for example like how most tennis shoes before the stan smith were really made out of canvas adidas came along and basically just added a leather upper instead of having a canvas upper and that really that was really received well by by tennis players they they really liked the support that the leather offered also with the name you know it was it was actually this shoe was originally called the robert haylett he actually was endorsing the shoe before stan smith did and then once he retired um adidas was looking for another person to kind of take up the mantle of endorsing the shoe after robert hayley retired and so that's when stan smith came along and uh yeah basically this guy has a lifetime deal with this face right here this little face right here has a lifetime deal with adidas to endorse the shoe and it's crazy because up until uh 05 it was actually a flat deal he was getting a flat fee to endorse the shoe um and then after 05 they actually negotiated royalties so literally for every pair you buy this guy adidas cuts this guy a check which is pretty awesome imagine having a lifetime deal man that's not too many people could say that so next reason is the prominence i there's tons of celebrities that have worn these and now i'm not saying that you need to buy a pair just because some celebrities or whatever what i am saying is that these shoes are pretty much appreciated by so many people they're appreciated by regular folk and celebrities alike you know and i know they're not as popular as they were before but these are just a shoe that just doesn't go out of style in my opinion this is just a widely beloved shoe both by men and women as well it's a very unisex shoe you know according to google trends as well you know these peaked around the uh 2016-2017 era you know that's when you know kanye was wearing them and everything even though they don't have that level of popularity as they did back in 2016 and 2017 these are still a timeless shoe you know you can't go wrong with these all right last reason is the price 80 bucks for these not bad if you ask me that's pretty affordable for these if you're one of those person who doesn't like spending like over 60 on a shoe or something like that just wait for the sales you know you wait for the sales usually you can get these for or if you even if you shop around you can find these for you know 60 or under usually so definitely very affordable and like i mentioned before the leather even though i'm not the biggest fan of the leather they have versions out there that are you know they're 90 to 100 and with that you're getting a lot better leather so that would actually increase the life of the shoe you know obviously the better quality leather so that is always an option available to you if you want to get a better version of the shoe it's gonna be more expensive but yeah you'll get better leather and your shoe will most likely last you longer than than the 80 pair of the originals that's pretty much gonna be it for the video we're gonna go try these on right now and i'm gonna give you guys a little montage of the shoes so you guys can kind of see what they look on feet so maybe we kind of look with different fits but i thank you guys for watching uh subscribe if you haven't already really appreciate it and i'll see you guys in the next one [Applause] is [Applause] uh earlier is you,2025-06-19 08:39:27.538637 UTC
X1VACUYkYP8,good day there How are you i've got the Adidas Originals men's Stan Smith sneaker here These are size 14 so quite large The Stan Smith line has been going for about 50 years I think So these are like a classic real easy wearing shoe It's got a rubber sole and you've got your stitching around the bottom there You've got um a leather upper as well That's how we're looking around the back The lace ups of course And then on the tongue you've got your iconic Stan Smith logo right there These are of course the white with the green trim but you can get other colors as well It says machine wash but I don't know I just generally use a bit of um soapy water and a cloth and then just dry them off afterwards I think that does the does the job pretty well as well I don't like the idea of them smashing around in the in the washing machine So with the laces of course you can get a bit more of a snugger fit And one thing I really like about what Adidas is up to at the moment or Adidas sorry if I'm saying that wrong is that they are introducing or have introduced and using more recycled materials which um is really important to me and if it is for you then these would be the way to go There's also a we note just saying size down by about half a size as the Stan Smith shoes tend to um be quite a large fit So that's just something to bear in mind as well So there we go That's the Adidas or Adidas classic men's Stan Smith sneaker A a timeless classic look with the uh the planet in mind A really nice simple yet very stylish shoe I love these guys and I'm sure you will,2025-06-19 08:39:27.899597 UTC
bGrSmmn3b2s,what's going on you guys - Barroso welcome to my channel yeah I know this time so for today's video I decided to change things up just a little bit and actually talk about one of the things that I absolutely love her style is actually juice so one of the shoes that I'm gonna be starting off with and well I guess you want to call them sneakers I usually say shoes I don't know why one of the shoes that I'm gonna be talking about in today's video as you might know since you read the title the adidas Stan Smith and just real quick if you're new to this channel please hit that subscribe button where I release new videos every week I give you guys more outfit inspiration and you can follow me on my Instagram at I'm Byron Orozco be sure to follow me on instagram and without further ado let's just talk about this beauty of a shoe that's Dan Smith now if you were to ask me what white sneakers should I start off wearing what do you recommend what is like the best to start off with well it's always gonna be the idea Stan Smith without a doubt and by the way this was actually my first Marisol yeah I stuck with this all up now just a little bit of a history behind this shoe it actually came out in 1965 and the Beatles were trying to look for a tennis athlete to promote the shoe and that's when they came across with Stan Smith who was a amazing tennis player winning 37 career single titles and 50 double crowns I don't know what that really means but damn that's pretty good I guess and you started wearing them in 1971 and actually became the number one tennis player in the world so this is gonna be like for today's video like both things so my experience with the shoe and basically like a review and also what I think you guys should be wearing when you wearing the shoe just to match your outfits and fit that fashion vibe so the first thing is to start off with the pro I mean it's really versatile as a leather quality on top it's actually really affordable you can find them on sale sometimes you just gotta be looking they could be up to like $50 on sale but the maximum price will be like 80 85 ish you really gotta do your research and just find like the perfect price book because they're really not that expensive in in my personal opinion I just think that they're timeless like they can just go on for like years and years and they're just so good and as for cons I mean there really isn't any like in my personal opinion but like the only thing I would complain about is that they mostly fall into the best fashion but but the thing is that it's just so Chris how I'm so good like you really can't complain that much about it however they're really not that high-end sneaker if you know what I'm talking about like the other expensive pair that you see other people wear but seriously though the Stan Smith's are very versatile too like any outfit that you put I mean look what I wore with this suit I mean it's just so versatile and they're just so great you know they can just use with anything really now going into the outfits really I mean you could basically use it with anything again they're versatile I use them in my casual looks street wear looks and formal looks which you guys know I've already used them in my past videos so if you would like to check them out the links are gonna be down in the description and one last thing the most important of all please guys keep them clean you're gonna look so much better just keeping them crispy white and clean like really those girls are definitely gonna notice I swear they look down are you beat and I've gotten a lot of compliments from just how great they look and trust me they're gonna notice that and that's a good thing and this video isn't sponsored by the way I mean well I wished it was bothered and that guy is like really though I mean as your first pair of white sneakers that plane get the idea since man thank you guys so much for watching I hope enjoy the video make sure you hit that like button subscribe if you're new all that's up for now I'll see you all the next video and I hope you all have a great day yourself,2025-06-19 08:39:28.040817 UTC

nf1PwJ9H8I4,man I love the feeling of this stance missed looks from Adidas [Applause] I think the quality on this Adidas Stan Smith look they are amazing for the price point that you pay for is only 145 I think the regular Stan Smith with PU leather upper I think it's around like 90 bucks I remember when I was in college and I know a friend that worked for Adidas and you know Adidas employee they often got 50 off for their products so we went to the store with him and we got 50 off on a pair of Stan Smith that was like dirt cheap I bet the whole sale on a pair of Stan Smith fresh out from Factory it's around like 20 to 25 dollars that they make them in the factory you know I think this version of Adidas stands Miss look should be a regular quality standard for all Adidas trainer the fitting on these shoes though is fit two two side uh usually when I wear a regular Stan Smith shoes with the Pu material upper they kind of hurt my forefoot a little bit but this one because the material is very soft and also very flexible so I don't really feel that discomfort around my far first area Comforts why is very comfortable I think the insole foam that they use is a little bit thicker than the regular stands met they come with three different colorways on the shoes this is the white colorway with the dark green mustache color pop and um the other one I think also white colorway with the black black and white sneaker is a little bit normal in my opinion and the other one was really nice too is the pair of triple black stand Smith besides using the premium leather on the shoes the construction wise also it's a little bit different around the Ice Age area on the regular stand Smith you can see they leave it as raw Edge but this one they fall all and Stitch so leave the edge is more cleaner and it look more premium and also this technique though they actually use more materials and at the tongue you can see there's Adidas three foil stands matte indoor buys and wet stands missed face I actually have an honor to met him in person before doing my Footwear design competitions that was a real experience because I didn't really check up his image before on the internet the only thing that I know about his face was really on this stance with a tongue the graphic on this tongue though is look almost a hundred percent identical to his real face in persons and also backs to the heel counter you can see there's a dark green colourpop mustache with the deboss of the tree foil and below that you can see there's a deboss up the Stan Smith's name and go to the tooling of the shoes is the using cup sole with the reinforcement stitches to reduce the bonding Gap and go to the lining of the shoes so this lining though is pretty good executed the Hue counter they use a real leather for a premium look and also the rest of the lining material from the heel counter to the toe area they used letters so they don't really cutting the budgets there unlike the regular stance mid they basically have the PU leather around the heel counter only if you look deeper into the lining material around the tall area they actually have the canvas molded create the top box so give it more D5 shape and also the insole they use a leather material on the surface of this insole foam now you hear all the good thing about this Adidas Stan Smith Lux right let's talk about one thing that I'm a little bit picky on the design of the shoes which is this Larry outside you can see the Stan Smith branding I would prefer this foil stencil branding go a little bit closer to the Hue counter which is in this area right here are similar to The Branding that they place on a pair of Samba that would look nicer in my personal reference because the foil stands with branding is a little bit distract me from that enjoying the quality leather of this pair of Stan Smith looks material of the shoes they are premium you know it's just less the quality of the leather speak for itself definitely it's the bad shoes from Adidas that release to close up this 2022 most of that small Footwear brand they basically have a copycat of the version Adidas stands matte and with the price boy around 200 to 250 dollars for just a knock up Stan Smith sneaker I'm not heading on the small brand do your thing but if your brand is just based on the premium leather and good craftsmanship and make in Italy then they can really compare it to this pair of Adidas stance Mist Lux because this pair of stance metal they have very rich history you know and styling with issues I believe everybody can look good with a pair of Stan Smith sneaker and dishes look good with everything jeans dress pants definitely is look better in dress pan in my opinion because you know this pair is unlike the regular Stan Smith sneaker this is Stan Smith's Lux for a reason so I think would look better on a pair of dress pants and up next I'm gonna share with you guys how I would like to style them foreign foreign thank you so there you go this is my quick review on this pair of Stan Smith looks from Adidas what a great shoes and I really like the quality on these shoes the middle a lot of time that I wouldn't recommend people to spend too much money on shoes and buy so many shoes but this is the great shoes for you if you're actually looking for a pair of white shoes to wear for this upcoming holiday season Christmas and New Year and also it's not just a great shoes for you it's also it's a good shoes as a present for your loved ones because you know who doesn't like the crunchy couple matching sneakers and if you like one of the look in this video give me a thumb up if you like the way how I review these products also give me a thumb up maybe it's the small thing for you to click on the thumb up but it's actually it's a big help for me and subscribe to my channel for more video I have a lot of video coming up every single week and I can't wait to share with you guys I'm

9a8XG8Sc3hE,what's up guys in this video i'll be reviewing and comparing the adidas dan smiths and adidas superstars to see which one you should buy all coming up right now gentlemen the stan smiths and the superstars are adidas best-selling and most iconic sneakers as they've been a cult classic for decades i mean just look at them they're fresh as hell boy the question is if i had to choose one which one would i choose and why so that's what i'll be answering in this video so i'll be comparing these two sneakers on price quality style fit and durability and at the end i'll give you guys the verdict on which sneaker comes out on top and is the one you should buy all right let's begin with the price starting with the stan smith so the adidas stan smith is going for 85 usd and 110 canadian whereas the adidas superstars are going for 85 usd as well and 100 canadian meaning they're the same price in the states but for some reason they're ten dollars more in canada i don't know my boys however i've seen both sneakers go on sale from time to time so you guys gotta watch out for those deals all right let's move on to quality so the stan smiths are made with the vegan prime green uppers which is made from high performance recycled materials and according to their website 50 of the upper is recycled content which is amazing my boys and the outsole is made from rubber waist as well as having a synthetic lining so as you guys can see it's a very eco-friendly sneaker as for the superstars the superstars are made with full grain leather uppers for comfort as well as providing better resistance against scuffs and scratches the shoe also has a mesh lining for breathability and they make your feet feel nice and comfy my boys there's also a padded heel collar for that plush feel and a signature rubber toe cap for that classic superstar look and enhance durability and last it has a rubber cup sole with a herringbone tread pattern for durability and traction so if you're a green eco-conscious person the stan smith is probably the choice for you as it supports green initiatives but if you want a more premium look and feel the superstars are a great choice alright let's move on to the style so this stan smith is the all-white version having a very clean and simple silhouette having the signature stan smith's logo on the tongue and heel tab and they also have that perforated stripes along the sides moving on to the superstars the superstars has that classic three-stripe branding on each side of the shoe at the midfoot as well as having the adidas tree foil branding on the tongue and heel plus having the superstars branding on the lateral sides and of course having the signature rubber toe cap for style and durability so in regards to style i would say the stan smith is the perfect sneaker if you want something simple and to put more of an emphasis on your outfit whereas the superstars are better if you want to dress more simple creating a higher emphasis on the shoe and before we move on to the fit of the sneakers if you guys are taking in a lot of value make sure you guys are smashing that like button my boys all right let's move on so for the stan smiths they do feel larger providing a lot of room they are super comfortable as that's why a lot of people use them for their daily shoes however if you want a more snug feel i'll recommend you to go a half size down but it's always best to try them on before you buy them boys as for the superstars they do fit larger providing a lot of room and fit more snug compared to the stan smiths in regards to the width and i think this gives the superstars an edge in regards to arch support and i would also recommend you to go a half size down as well so for me i prefer the fit of the stan smiths as it just fits more roomier and feels more comfortable to me let's move on to durability so both sneakers will definitely last a long time in your wardrobe my boys and even though i'm in support for green and sustainable initiatives based on the feel and the material used in the superstars i definitely think the superstars will last longer than the stan smiths alright let's move on to the verdict boys the stan smith and the superstars are amazing sneakers having been a classic for decades for streetwear and men's fashion enthusiasts however if i had to choose one i would definitely go for the stan smiths as i prefer a more simple silhouette due to the sneaker complementing my outfits better so if you dress more casual or want to put a higher emphasis on your outfit then i would definitely recommend you to go for the stan smiths and if you dress more streets or typically dress simple and want to put an emphasis on your sneakers then the superstars are definitely for you and guys that's it for this adidas dan smith's versus a superstars comparison,2025-06-19 08:39:29.617755 UTC

8XA3NOBegWI,"i don't know when this happened i'm not sure if it's just with this release or this is the first release to have this change or if I just haven't bought a pair of mids in a while but we've got a dope new box this is sick hey what's going on guys my name is Chris welcome back to the official wear testers.com YouTube channel today we got a detailed look and breakdown on one of the I would say arguably most popular Air Jordan 1 mids of all time and that is the Air Jordan 1 mid New Love but before we deep dive into these bad boys we do have a quick word from today's sponsor and that's the good folks over at Door Dash door Dash wants us to remind you that you deserve something that makes life easier and saves you money so give yourself a pass with Dash Pass and get 0 delivery fees on all eligible orders so whether you need a quick bite to eat some groceries or even some office supplies Dash Pass with Door Dash is here to help you out dashpass is an exclusive membership through Door Dash where you can filter your search results and narrow things down based off of who has zero dollar delivery fees so when you happen to forget that one item at the grocery store or you need to make a quick run for some office supplies but just simply don't have time Dash Pass has got you covered so again get more from delivery for less with Dashpass where there are $0 delivery fees and reduce service fees on eligible Door Dash orders so if this sounds like something that would interest you make sure that you sign up for Dashpass with the link in our description box or the QR code that you see on the screen now and all new members get 30 days free now with that being said like I was saying before it looks like that these have a brand new box lid for I'm not sure if it's this release or not like I said I haven't bought a pair of mids in a minute but the overall box is the same as a traditional Air Jordan 1 midbox so you got the Wings logo everywhere black and red color theme sort of an ode to the original black and red Nike box that the original Air Jordan 1 high would come in but these ones are a flip lid or whatever you call this regular box you know what I mean not a there's not a lid that you take off but again the graphics on the lid a little bit different and I really with this i think that this is sick the shoes themselves I also think are really cool but I also grew up in I don't know what you call it the original lifespan of Air Jordan products so like as I was growing up there was the flagship models and then all of a sudden there were retros and mids were part of that and I liked it cuz it was the only thing we had so if you wanted a pair of Jordan ones they were going to be mids and this actually is a pack that I just remember super fondly they originally came out in 2007 and it was an actual two pack of sneakers so while these are releasing by themselves the original version of this shoe came out side by side with one of my favorite colorways which is the black toes and they were awesome now after its initial release in 2007 we saw the shoe release once again as a retro but by itself for the first time in 2017 now we're in 2025 and here they are again i will say that it's probably the best looking of the three versions because this doesn't look like the previous two and again the previous two was all we were getting back then so like they were cool at that moment but I do think that Jordan Brand is I don't know what you would call it i guess the best word was like refining you know what I mean like refining its retro product slowly but surely that is a little irritating for some people i I completely understand that too but for someone like me that's been buying these shoes for what feels like the majority of my life seeing them I don't know like you know refine them i feel like it feels good it's like yeah you guys are listening we don't want inaccurate stuff we want things as accurate and as cool looking as possible and they're doing that but these guys right here are the 2025 edition i actually grabbed them i don't know when they're supposed to release but they're sitting over at dtlr.com so shout out to one of our viewers PMJC longtime viewer OG viewer at that he actually sent me over a link on Instagram he DM'd me and he was just like ""Bro look what's available."" I was like ""Thank you check out."" But yeah the 2025 edition is pretty cool I think and we're going to start that off with the outsole it is translucent yellow just like it always was this looks very very bright though compared to the original it's not the same tone i know that would bother you actually I'm going to bring in the extra set of laces that they come with the laces are a yellow and they're not the same yellow as the shoe or as the outsole this yellow that the laces are reminds me more of what the original shoe looked like cuz I feel like this is too bright i could be remembering I felt like this with the UNCC1's i also felt like this with the Mellow 12s so for all I know my brained up and I just don't know it but I felt like these were a little bit deeper of a yellow i I can't remember but either way we've got a trifecta of different yellow shades whether you like it or not and that's just kind of what it is the yellow on the outsole though is definitely just kind of It's kind of neon it's like highlighterish so yeah I don't remember them being like this maybe once you start wearing them they'll get a little bit darker i'm not sure but the pattern itself is the greatest traction pattern of all time it's fantastic its traction is so good it'll pop your hip out now the midsole is a cupsole and it's a rubber cupsole at that inside of that rubber cupsole is a polyurethane wedge and inside of that wedge is an encapsulated airsole unit sitting on top of that is this piece of right here this is an awful insole and uh you can take this out so long as you take it out before you wear it cuz you see all these lines here are actually glue so as you wear them your foot and the heat that comes out of it will actually heat this up and the pressure from your weight and everything like that will adhere it down so the insole will be damn near impossible to remove afterwards unless you use a hair dryer on its lowest heat setting and sit there and wave it back and forth until the glue heats up and then you would be able to pull it out easier but still I would take this out instantly and change it out for anything now the upper based off of what I remember I feel like and I'm I'm pretty sure I'm remembering this wrong too i remember the upper on the original 2007 release being a lot softer and feeling just nicer in hand but I know that they were synthetics you know what I mean like I I know that they weren't good materials this though this is an SE release so typically with an Air Jordan 1 midse and we have talked about this previously in a previous video where we lined them all up together and told you the differences between quality this is a better quality they just feel stiff so uh I feel like the the materials while better than maybe the 2007 release they just don't feel as soft as those but again they make up for it with the tweaks that they've made along the upper with the shape and all of that stuff so maybe there's like a trade-off there but either way the black material is it's an actual leather it's just not good leather not anywhere close to good leather by the way but there's leather traces or traces of leather in it and then on top of basically all of those little like pieces of scrapped leather fibers they've glued on this synthetic Newuk coating uh it's not genuine Newuk where it's literally a piece of hide but it does have animal material in it so uh this is not vegan friendly or anything like that it's not uh fully synthetic or anything it is a synthetic top coat though synthetic in the terms of it's mimicking Newuk without being Newuk now the yellow portions are leather and in some portions of the shoe it looks pretty decent like say the swoosh it's a nice thick cut looks pretty good the rest of it though is ultra thin so again it's real leather it's just not the best leather or anything like that is it SE quality or anything like that i would say that this is on the lower end of the SE mids that I've seen some of the most recent SE mids that I run across in store are actually really nice including the leather like there's some really good pairs out there they just so happen to be mids so if I'm comparing this shoe to some of those this just doesn't feel quite you know on par with that material quality or the the level of material that the majority of the SE models get i think that this one is just a little bit more hyped up and I say that real loosely because it is a mid but it's just a popular colorway so I think they're doing what they can to get away with not spending as much on this one because they don't really need to although I will say that there's a little extra touch here on the ankle collar which is the Wings logo it's a Jewel Wings logo which is just like the original version back in 2007 within the pack but different than the 2017 version which was just a pressed on logo and stuff like that like what we traditionally see so they at least reverted it back to the way that it was supposed to be so this is more of a one:1 retro despite the shape changes to its original counterpart now if you were to look at a side profile picture of the original you would see that the collar right here has definitely been reworked since that 2007 release this guy just feels a lot more natural looks a lot better it looks a lot more like an Air Jordan 1 and not necessarily like an Air Jordan 1 mid whereas the 2007 release there was a definite like dip in the collar and stuff like that they made it more comfortable to wear i will say that especially since some of this like this synthetic New Buck is stiff so this is going to like somebody's ankles but again a refined product it looks smoother right now so I like this the biggest change at least in my opinion actually comes on the heel and this little bottom panel right here as you can see on this most recent 2025 edition it's just the panel there's nothing else there you know what was there originally the Jumpman logo it was but yeah the original version had a Jumpman on the heel that's how a lot of the retros after the initial like OG retros from 1999 and stuff like that that's how they were i believe that's how the 2017 was as well with a heel jumpman these just look a lot smoother it's very simple though to be able to look at this and know that this is the newest one versus one of the oldest ones because again that's the biggest change so that's how you would know the tongue is not my favorite thing it is nylon but it's just really padded like this is one stiff piece of material right here they don't put the stitches all the way down them like they have been on some of the more recent ones where they kind of like fold and move along with your foot shape and stuff but the more that you wear it the more it'll break in it's just not my favorite thing i wish they would just do a regular nylon tongue if anything I think I remember these being Newuck but I could be wrong now in terms of sizing they do fit true to size whatever you typically wear with an Air Jordan 1 that's exactly what I would go with here again the materials are just not quite as soft as something like an OG high or some of the other midsees so you're just going to need to break them in a little bit but outside of that if you used to own these and you really missed them so here's another chance to get them or maybe you really wanted them and you didn't get them again here's another chance to get them so I think that this is really cool it's a shoe that every time I see it it just brings me back to a simpler time in sneakers and I really dig it like this at least back then it was a vibe but with all of that being said what is today's user submitted question of the day okay the ability or capability to play basketball or wear anything black this includes shoes shirt heck even your underwear if you had to give up one of those two things which would it be i'm playing basketball what kind of question is that that's the question of the day take away something I absolutely love or something that I mean I could live without it i'd miss you in a black shirt i mean I wear predominantly black i know so you wouldn't be able to anymore i know so I'd have to pick some weird color but like not even hints of black so yeah nope so I'd only be able to wear like solid shoes or or like Yes yeah no I'm still picking basketball but those other shoes still exist right they still exist you just don't get to have them okay you know how long I've lived without them things what's a little more time you know what I mean i just live vicariously through everyone else like I did growing up it's okay i'm good playing basketball okay cool let's sound off below and let us know your answer for today's question of the day and on top of all of that what do you think about the Air Jordan 1 Midse New Love coming back once again thank you guys so much for being here thank you so much for watching we will catch y'all in the next one so until then you guys have a good one look no I think they're leftovers from those Jordan ones i thought the same thing like I normally don't agree with you about the whole color thing it doesn't it doesn't bother me usually but this is atrocious like this is like a blatant like nobody cared it's like somebody said ""Is this the right color in an email?"" And the dude was like ""Yeah sure."" Yeah no it's like highlighter melted crayon and golden rod like I'm like ""Bro that's crazy how'd you up three times",2025-06-19 08:40:07.508450 UTC
UGuUskVXBms,"the air jordan 1 shattered backboard is one of the best air jordan releases of all time and finally 10 years after it first released jordan brand is bringing it back for the first time this is the 2025 air jordan 1 shattered backboard but can it live up to the hype let's find out in the summer of michael jordan's rookie year in 1985 he decided to go play an exhibition game in italy the italian club that he was making an appearance for was stfananiel trieste whose color scheme was orange black and white during that game michael scored 30 points which is pretty decent but it wasn't the most impressive thing of the entire event during one of his dunks he jumps up grabs the rim and shatters the backboard and that event became one of the most legendary stories in basketball history especially because it happened to the goat so to pay homage to that event in 2015 jordan bran released the shattered backboard air jordan 1's which came in the color scheme of the jersey that he was wearing for that team and featured a shattered backboard graphic on the insole as legendary as that story is and as great as this colorway is specifically because of the color blocking the reason this shoe became so popular and one of the most iconic air jordan sneakers of all time is because this shoe featured some of the best leather ever used on jordan sneakers for the last 10 years whenever a new jordan comes out people always ask the question is the leather on that shoe shattered backboard quality and that's because the shattered backboard one set the bar in terms of modern leather quality on air jordan sneakers this shoe just feels incredible in the hand that said it is still a mass-produced pair of sneakers it's not as high quality as a $1,000 handmade designer shoe especially not leather quality-wise but compared to any of the recent jordan releases or any of the releases around the time of this shoe releasing it was miles ahead it set the bar for quality the tumbled leather on the side of the shoe felt incredibly soft even the leather on the toe just felt so plush and looked so good you could see the pores around the heel of the shoe which is not something that you can usually see on air jordan sneakers and there was this really nice color variation because it was real leather and it wore really nicely and man the grain on the edges of the leather panel it just looked amazing and it gets better with age the more that you wear it so when a rumor came out that jordan brand was finally bringing back the shatter backboards the question that immediately came to everyone's mind was is the quality going to be as good and i don't know if you caught my comparison video between the shattered backboards and the new shatterback boards but unfortunately the answer is not as good as i was hoping and of course we'll get into all of that later on in the video but with that being said if you want a chance to win a nintendo switch 2 for yourself i'm actually giving away one over on my tech channel which is linked in the top of the description below of course like all of my giveaways i'm running it through core which is the fairest and i think the best way to do it so if you guys want to have a chance to win this console for yourself you need to get the core badges again they're all going to be on my tech channel some of which will be on this channel so make sure to subscribe to both check them both out the giveaway ends at the end of the month so hopefully by the end of the month you're playing a brand new switch too we'll see what happens for those of you like myself who have been eagerly waiting the retro of the classic shatter backboards the good news is you don't have that much longer to wait these shoes should release on august 23rd 2025 for a retail price of 180 bucks now of course if you want to grab a pair early like i did you can check them out through the youtube shopping tab on your screen down below currently resale prices are kind of high that being said the time that i've spent with this shoe and also the resale prices of some of the other air jordan ones that have released recently i would assume that this price is going to drop pretty quickly so in my opinion if you want to grab these early there's a good chance that the prices will drop to probably around retail is my guess possibly under retail once they actually release i could be wrong about that but we'll see i'm kind of dancing around the subject here but you guys will see why in a minute but before we get into the shoes themselves let's first take a look at the packaging and i've got to say that jordan brand knocked this box out of the park why is it that some of jordan brand's lackluster sneaker releases end up having the best boxes not trying to foreshadow too hard but probably catching my drift now if you guys remember the 2015 release of the shatter backboards came in a standard air jordan 1 box it was black and red you guys all know the drill this time around jordan brand decided to change it up and not only make the logo on the box orange to match the shoe but also give this box this really cool shattered glass print this print is so sick and it really makes this box super unique super cool and probably one of the coolest jordan 1 boxes that i've ever seen problem is you can't wear jordan boxes so a lot of people were like ""why do you review the boxes?"" well it's part of the packaging for me it's important for you you might not care but i got to give credit where credit's due they did a great job with this box this shattered glass pattern actually extends all the way around the box even to the bottom which is super cool now getting to the size tag as you can see this is not exactly my standard size this is a size eight i got them from bird kicks it was the only pair that i could actually grab that was even remotely close to my size the official colorway of this shoe is black black sail starfish and again it is a size eight i'm a size nine but as you'll see through some of the b-roll shots i did squeeze my chunky foot into this tiny sneaker i guess it's all relative because someone with a size 12 would say that they have a chunky foot and my foot's tiny but now let's dive into the brand new shattered back boys themselves and first things first we got to talk about the quality it's not as good in fact it's nowhere near as good the leather on the originals feels different it feels immediately different and more premium the leather on the new pair feels like every single other pair of air jordan ones it's plasticky it's stiff it's got this like eh tumbled texture that's obviously not not real uh not the tumbled leather is a real thing it's a texture that's literally tumbled onto the leather but in this case it just feels worse i don't know if it's actually tumbled on or if it's pressed on or how they do it with this more plasticky feeling leather but who knows so i'm going to compare these shoes as we go throughout this review and talk about the differences as we get to the different parts of the shoe so we'll start things off around the toe you've got this black mud guard on the 2025 pair the leather is your standard black leather it's kind of stiff it's nothing special on the 2015 pair it was soft it was supple it was beautiful moving up to the leather on the toe the first thing you'll notice is that the color is different on these shoes the leather on the 2015 pair is a much lighter shade of orange it's closer to a yellow the color on the new pair is much closer to a red they're both definitely orange neither one is not an orange or leaning too close towards red or yellow but i will say that the orange on the 2025 pair is darker and more red than the orange on the 2015 pair and maybe this is just because i like the 2015 pair better i'm not totally sure but i think i prefer the actual color of the orange better on the 2015 pair it feels more aged and this is the color that it always was like the leather didn't change color over the last 10 years it still looks like this even looking at brand new pairs the new pair just seems more it's not as natural of an orange not that you get too much natural orange leather but if you did i think it would be closer to this than to this it kind of feels like this was naturally sweetened and this was artificially sweetened if you get my drift in terms of the actual feel i mean it's it's night and day this is kind of stiff regular air jordan 1 leather this is your sort of plush shatter backboard leather uh it's disappointing i can't i can't sugarcoat it moving up in the shoe you've got more of that black leather on the eye it's the same black leather you have around the toe weaving through the eyelets you get a set of black flat laces which is the laces that i just ended up using cuz that's how i have them on my original shattered backboards they do also give you a set of matching orange laces which it's actually a little bit lighter than the orange used on the shoe which is a little odd but you get them if you want to switch them out i don't think i ever would but you can if you want to underneath the laces you've got a pretty standard black nylon tongue and towards the top of the tongue you've got this white nike air tag with nike air embroidered into it in orange now just for the sake of comparison the tag and the feel of the tongue is basically exactly the same as the 2015 pair they both are nylon they both come in black i guess the embroidery placement on the tag is a little bit different on the older pair it's kind of a little bit lower you've got some more white towards the top on the newer pair it's a little bit more centered moving inside the shoe the sock liner comes in black and it's a very similar material to what you had on the original shatter backboards however the foam inside is not as soft like the foam on this shoe just feels more pillowy this one feels more like you press into it and it immediately bounces back this one feels more i don't know like a just like a softer foam that's really all it is it's a softer foam i don't think that's because of age either it just feels like a different foam now it looks like the design of the insole is pretty similar to the original if not the same however the color of the printing is a little bit different probably to match the orange on the upper of the shoe now when it comes to sizing and fit this is where things get a little bit tough because i don't have a true size 9 that's what i usually wear and i'm not just talking about the new shatterburg 1.0's these are a size eight but in the original 1.0's i was only able to get a size eight and a half so even this one is a half size down so i don't have either in my true size but i will say compared to other shoes that have released around the same time and look construction-wise the same this one true to size this one also true to size now construction-wise the older pair the 2015 pair isn't as comfortable underfoot they've sort of made some comfort adjustments throughout the years to make the newer versions of the shoe a bit more comfortable which i appreciate and generally i'd say newer pairs of air jordan 1's have a wider toe box and it looks like this one does as well so that's a plus i think comfort-wise this pair should be ever so slightly more comfortable but realistically it's still a jordan 1 and jordan 1's are all not that comfortable and as far as sizing goes i would say go true to size like every other pair of jordan 1's of course if you've never tried on a pair of jordan ones before go down to your local foot locker try a pair on i'm sure they have a ton of pairs available they'll probably have these available too is my guess maybe i'm wrong so try a pair on first before you drop the 180 bucks or however much it ends up being continuing back in the shoe to the midfoot we get to another pretty big departure from the original release and that's the new color of the midfoot leather on the original pair you get this very soft and nicely tumbled sail colored leather on the new pair it's bright white and it's not soft of all the things that they decided to change i understand the quality although i hate the fact that they didn't update the quality i get that that's not exactly the same like the original but the color of the midfoot panel why would you not make this sale like the original instead of the sale color that you get in the original you get a white midfoot panel which i think also doesn't look as good i personally much prefer the more yellow colored orange accents on this shoe and the sail colored midfoot panel to the much redder orange on this shoe with the white midfoot panel at a distance though realistically if you're wearing the shoe you're probably not going to be able to tell them apart same thing that you have on the lateral side you have on the medial side unfortunately and then moving towards the back of the shoe you've got more of this sort of dark orange leather that when you compare it side by side to the original it is night and day man it's crazy like this is all one consistent shade of orange which is fine there's nothing wrong with that but on the original release there's some color variation you can see the grain through the edges of the leather like you can see that on this pair too but it's obviously nicer you can see pores in this one you can't see pores in this one you can see color variation and like certain parts are a little bit more yellow or a little bit more orange you can see much more going on in the actual leather itself on the original release versus the new release and while they feel similar because this leather is sort of stretched over the heel of the shoe it's pretty obvious that the original pair is significantly nicer as you probably could have guessed by this point the leather around the top of the ankle the black leather is also nicer on the original it's still not amazing on the original this leather is just kind of your standard jordan leather at least for the time on the original but on the new pair it's it's plasticky one other interesting change but it kind of makes sense based on the time that these shoes released is that the wings logo is slightly different on the 2015 pair the wings logo is pressed into the leather or debossed into the leather on the 2025 pair it's actually much truer to the og where it's embossed out of the leather like you've got the texture of the ball the texture of the wing kind of coming out of the shoe i actually think i prefer because this is the more original way to do it this is the way that they did it in 1985 but i also didn't have a problem with the way they did it back in the day so for me either one is fine doesn't really matter maybe that's one thing that this pair has over the old pair maybe i like the wings logo better not everyone will but i guess i do and the box the box is better i like the box better moving down on these shoes to the midsoles the midsole on the newer release does seem whiter than it was on the older release that could also be because of age like i've worn this pair a little bit and this pair's rubber is also 10 years older than the rubber on this pair so maybe it just yellowed a little bit over time i'm not totally sure i wouldn't be surprised either way like if the rubber is just whiter overall and this one also aged a little bit finally moving to the bottom of the shoe you've got a matching orange outsole on the new pair of course you did have that in the old pair my pair is worn um the orange is obviously redder on this pair than on the original which again would make sense because it matches the leather so overall not only are there differences in design between these two shoes and color between these two shoes but there's also a pretty big discrepancy in quality the original pair felt amazing still feels amazing is one of the best jordan ones to ever release the new pair is a jordan 1 retro a standard jordan 1 retro with shatter backboard color blocking that's the best way to say it it's wild because even the shatter backboard 2.0's which weren't as nice as this shoe still feel better than the new version of the original it really is it's nothing special man it's it's really disappointing to say if you missed out on the original shattered backboards and you want that color blocking look you want the orange and you want the black then yeah grab the new pair if you think for even a second the quality of this pair is as good as the original sorry it's just not straight up it's not go to your local nike outlet right now check out a pair of jordan 1's or even your local foot locker check out a pair of recently released air jordan 1's a standard colorway not a limited pair that's what this feels like is that the worst thing in the world no not at all but when the original pair was known for its quality known for the way that it felt the fact that the retro is not even close sucks but hey if you made it to this point in the video let me know your thoughts on the new shattered backboard 1.0's will you be grabbing a pair for yourself i'd love to know leave it in the comment section down below don't forget to

wqZFzkALYt8,these are the worst creasing sneakers ever does that make sense when it comes to sneakers for under 250 this is definitely one of them these are a close second let's check out how bad these actually crease first off hold on wait a second usually sneakers don't come with a dust bag like this but this is kind of cool it's not really a dust bag more of like a satchel let's get straight to the business ooh baby these are one of them all right the satin bread Air Jordan 1 these are sleepers let's see how bad they actually crease and these for those of you who don't know are a women's release so all the boys out there that are over a size 10 and 1 12 you can kiss these goodbye but luckily I can squeeze the 10 and 1 half barely all right let's see how bad these actually crease ooh baby oh no all right and after we just put these things to the test here's the result honestly I think everybody online is kind of tweaking about this it's not that big of a deal we busted this myth but honestly who cares about creases anyway,2025-06-19 08:40:07.596610 UTC
eMGIciKbz6g,hey what's up Zach here and if you've seen the last dance on Netflix I'm sure you caught the sneaker episode where Michael Jordan was talking about his feet being soaked in Blood and absolutely killing him after wearing the Jordan 1 for his last game at Madison Square Garden back in 1998 years after its initial release and also after a season of wearing the Jordan 13 but if the Jordan 1 was good enough for Jordan years earlier in the 80s and it's arguably one of the most worn sneakers on the Planet why did they tear his feet up so bad the last time he wore them in a game and is the Jordan one dangerous for you to wear let's find out now to answer this you first have to look at what both the Jordan one and the Jordan 13 are made of and what their performance characteristics are I mean there's no point in denying that Jordan 1 was a real turning point for sneakers and for its time in 1985 they were a real head turning design with a more up midsole really strong upper overlays made of that action leather which is really just cow leather with a polyurethane coating not to mention the famous Jordan 1 out Souls with that Bullseye Traction in the forefoot as well as all this compartmentalized rubber in the heel and there's also plenty of video evidence of Michael Jordan absolutely destroying defenders in these shoes when they were his regular game day shoe but fast forward in 1998 when Michael Jordan was playing in the Jordan 13s for the bulk of that season and after 13 years you know they featured a lot more forgiving materials in the midfoot and especially the uppers with more soft Leathers more textile fibers and in the midsole you had two Zoom airbags plus just the midsole that was a lot more ergonomic it just fit the bottom of the foot a little bit better so it cradled the arch exponentially better than a flat rubberized midsole which obviously offered less than optimal shock absorption when talking about the Jordan 1es and you know the outsole on the 13s is actually a personal favorite of mine now it's modeled after a Black Panther's paw and these have exceptional lateral stability but they're also solid as a rock and how they cradle What's called the gabrius junction of your foot now what is that the gabrius junction of your foot is where the bottom of your foot in the top of your foot meet where the skin meets and you can actually tell exactly where that is because the skin on the bottom of your foot is going to look a lot different than the top and that equator of your foot is also where the shoe is going to have the maximum potential to stabilize your foot going side to side and the Jordan 13s do this better than actually a lot of modern day shoes do and when you put these two sneakers head-to-head on court looking at their speed on the suicide test the Jordan 13s came in at 14.90 seconds and and really did their best work when cornering with that mid and out soole just made perfectly for grabbing the court when the foot was off center now versus the Jordan one that came in at 15.76% how the shoe made me work for that time because when you look inside the Jordan 1es they're almost a flat sole Without Really any wide lateral flange or any Dynamic elements to really redistribute the weight so each stride induces much more shock into the foot and leg versus on the 13s Plus on turns the foot is kind of allowed to slide back and forth within the shoe on the insole or the strobo board so there's more friction and heat buildt up with each cut pivot or turn however when looking at just the traction both on an asphalt or concrete and a hardwood Court the Jordan one's traction holds up just uncommonly well even against brand new outsole designs designed with AI and loads of player data it just really goes to show you that sometimes a good design can hold up over a long period of time and if you're a fan of Jordan brand or just a sneaker head in general I'm sure you realized I did that suicide test on a clear rubber outsole on the Jordan 1 and as a lot of us know it clear rubber does not grip as well on asphalt or concrete as a dyed Rubber outsole and I was still getting really terrific grip even on this clear rubber outsole so it just shows you just how well the Jordan 1's outsole was designed even on the more slick outsole tread it's still grabbing around those corners but I think is even more interesting than the grip of the Jordan 1es is how that grip almost Dooms the shoe because when you're stopping on the court the Jordan one is grabbing really well however it's not grabbing your foot inside the shoe that well so all that inertia and body weight even even though the shoe is stopped is still moving within the shoe so the grip of the Jordan 1es and how great it is also really accentuates how bad the shoe is for holding you inside the shoe but I think my favorite part of the performance comparison of these shoes was a jump height test and now when I compared both models jump height scores the Jordan 13s gave me 34 cm of jump height on average which I really thought was pretty remarkable given how old the shoe is however what was more impressive to me was the Jordan 1's jump pight scores which I got 27 CM on average of jump height which is better than some new shoes I've tested recently and for me the key factors in both these shoes jump height scores came down to their respective midsoles the Jordan 13 just has a much more ballistic type midsole it's also a lot more ergonomic remember it has the carbon fiber shank and zoom airbags on both sides of it plus that midsole is much more cradling to those really large Arch muscles so the shoes just easier to get up off the ground plus it gives you a little bit of a spring board effect from the carbon fiber and on the Jordan 1's kind of an opposite effect remember the midsole and the Jordan 1's a little more rubberized and just gives them a little bit more pop versus shoes nowadays with more standard Eva or etpu midsoles but once again the problem in the Jordan 1's comes down to what happens when you land from that jump on the 13s the midsole foam and the air disperse that Force into the shoe whereas on the ones once again they force your foot muscles to make up that difference in shock absorption I think one of the the biggest differences between the ones and the 13s that really goes into the radar and has a ton to do with how much the foot is allowed to slip back and forth in the shoe is just how much stiffer and more resilient the 13's heel counter is this little plastic piece that goes up here that controls your heel motion whereas on the ones I mean I cut right through it it's just made a really flimsy material and on the 13s it's really stiff so it's holding that foot and it's holding that healing and honestly that more than anything brings me to why Michael Jordan's feet were soaked in blood all of these factors all increase friction and heat within the shoe and when you're playing pro basketball they will lead to your skin breaking down pretty quick from abrasions and blistering even though Michael Jordan had a really great game that night it was Michael Jordan's body that was making up for all these performance metrics versus when he was playing in the 13s when they were just doing a lot of that work for him and that's also the reason his feet were fine in the Jordan 1es a decade before and writhing in them 13 years later your body just gets used to what's around it same reason a carpenter's hand gets blistered the first time they use a hammer for an extended period and after their skin adapts it's no big deal and in Jordan's case he built up all that skin tolerance and muscles in his foot only presented with much more plush options later down the road as new Jordan shoes came down the line and then once he got adapted to those all of a sudden you throw the Jordan Ones in the mix during a really high level of play and that cycle just has to start all over again and your body being 13 years older well that's really hard transition to make over just one game but so to answer the question are the Jordan 1es dangerous for you to play in if they were able to do that to Michael Jordan's foot one of the greatest of all time well no I mean your foot's going to get used to whatever you put it in and remember his foot being soaked in blood I mean that can happen with just a big blister so you know sometimes you know Netflix with these documentaries they're they're trying to Hype it up a little bit and they're trying to get you to click and watch longer so just because his foot was soaked in blood doesn't mean you know the shoe was literally tearing his foot from his ankle but I do think if you're used to playing in shoes like the Jordan 13 or shoes that have just come out this year remember you're going to be used to that plush feeling under foot you're going to be used to the stack under your foot and when you go to a shoe that pretty much has none in the forefoot you know your body is not going to like that for a little while it's the same reason why you can't just start barefoot running a marathon right away if you've been using maximalist type Hoka running shoes remember your foot just has to get used to whatever it's in slowly and remember there are some people that just do not do well with low stacked shoes and there are people that do just fine with them so it really is on a caseby Case basis however if you are somebody that is used to the modern-day basketball shoe it's probably better off that you stay with that modern-day basketball shoe because while your body is trying to adjust to it you could be leaving yourself susceptible to stress fractures btis or even really bad bad skin issues like blistering or abrasions and also there are ways to make the Jordan 1 feel like a more modern-day shoe and that usually comes down to putting an orthotic in the shoe whether it be over- the- counter or custom now if you are interested in custom orthotics and kind of don't know where to start I do have a four-page digital download with my favorite builds for orthotics for certain foot types as well as people of different weights and measures of their foot so if you want to check that out that is down in the description for download but you know I think one of the biggest points that got driven home to me when I was making this video is that sometimes newer isn't always better I mean especially in the case of the Jordan 13 I mean honestly this shoe is a lot better than a lot of modern-day basketball shoes that I've reviewed this year and honestly the design of it is pretty simple I mean the design of the outsole is designed after a panther paw you know just something you find in nature it's just a simple Herring bone design and it's a really ergonomic midsole it just mimics the shape of the bottom of the foot and with a lot of these other shoes now they're made with more player data and force plate analysis and they're using AI to design the outsole I mean sometimes I think this kind of gets more to analysis to paralysis they're just trying to find a solution to a problem that doesn't exist you know in 1998 they figured this out and they found a pretty darn good design that holds up just as well today but you know honestly I'd love to hear from you do you ever find yourself playing competitively in the Jordan 1 and you know what's your experience been with them and you know if not the Jordan one then what's your favorite Jordan shoe to play in let me know in the comments down below and you know like Jordan said in that episode of The Last Dance there's been a lot of innovation in shoe technology from the 1 to the 13 so if you want to see all the innovation in technology from the 13 to the 36 make sure you click on this video up above and subscribe down below respect Rubber and foam and action leather I'll see you in the next video,2025-06-19

PMXmoH2eWTI,new shoes who dis I've been eyeing these shoes for a long time and I've finally got my hands on here's my quick review of the Jordan 1 golf shoes in wolf gray this is the same colorway as the Dior Jordan Ones but obviously not the same price so the golf version of the Jordan Ones don't have spikes but they have more tread for golfing I have other pairs of Jordan Ones and I'm gonna be the first to say that they're not the most comfortable shoe but these golf versions are so comfortable they also don't look too bad on the course,2025-06-19 08:40:08.570784 UTC

dntmuB6kw_A,this shoe is sneaker of the Year there I said it what's up everybody I'm Seth Fowler and today I'm reviewing the upcoming Air Jordan one Chicago lost and found there's been a lot of really strong sneaker releases this year there's been a lot of great new tech there's been exciting new designs and there's even been some really solid Retros however none of those sneakers have the story or the looks or the history that this sneaker has in my opinion this sneaker is the full package and that's why it's the best sneaker of the year so far for the last year and a half since we heard that we might be getting a retro of the Chicago Air Jordan 1es I've been heavily anticipating this shoe in fact this shoe has been number one on my list of my most anticipated sneakers of 2022 I've been waiting for this shoe for a long time I mean realistically since the last Chicago release back in 2015 and man I've got to say this shoe does not disappoint this shoe absolutely lives up to the height now after gassing this shoe up for the last couple minutes I'm sure you're wondering how you can get your hands on a pair of Air Jordan 1 Chicago lost and founds well originally this shoe was supposed to release at the end of October however Jordan brand has since pushed back the release date to November 19th 2022 and unfortunately because this shoe is a special edition or maybe even a more premium version of the Air Jordan 1's it does come with a slightly higher retail price of 180 bucks the good thing is though this shoe is absolutely worth that price unfortunately for me though that's not the amount that I paid I grabbed my pair on Goat because they had a pair on instant ship for an amount that I'm honestly kind of embarrassed to say so I'm not going to and I did accidentally buy two pairs so now I have an extra pair which I'm not exactly sure what I'm going to do with yet I may give it away so if you guys are interested in possibly winning a pair of these for yourself make sure to hit that subscribe button if you haven't yet because if I do give it away I will announce it on the channel also if you're crazy like me and you want to grab a pair of these early I've made sure to leave an affiliate link to goat in the top of the description below as much as I love this shoe the amount that I paid was was probably not worth it before we get into the sneaker though let's first take a look at the Box because the packaging is one of the reasons why this sneaker is so great so obviously because this is a special edition release Jordan brand did decide to change things up pretty dramatically on the box and on the packaging so there are two things that will immediately catch your eye about this box the first is that the Box stop and the Box are mismatched and the second is that the way that Jordan brand printed the design on the box it gives this box a very old and distressed look which I absolutely love and the reason for these changes is actually the story or the inspiration behind this entire package and that's that this box and even shoe is designed to look like it's been lost in storage in the basement of a mom and pop shop for the last 30 plus years hence the name lost and found from what I've heard the design of the sneaker and the design of the packaging is meant to pay homage to the mom and pop shops of the ' 80s and the 90s unfortunately mom and pop shops are not as prevalent as they once were a lot of that has to do with the fact that Jordan brand is no longer sending stock to Mom and Pop shops because they're trying to sell more online because they have much better margins but that's neither here nor there so like I said the idea behind this shoe was that this was an Air Jordan 1 that went on sale back in the 80s and then it was lost in storage they didn't even have an original Air Jordan 1 box stop to throw on this Air Jordan 1 Chicago box so they used a random Nike box top and the whole idea behind this sneaker and the story behind this shoe is really really interesting and I love it on the front of the box there is actually a really cool set of sale stickers to let you know that this shoe went on sale but unfortunately because I bought this pair from goat they decided to cover up that detail with their goat sticker which sucks but uh at least you can still sort of see the outline of the sale stickers so there's that in addition to those sales stickers you also have the size tag as you can see I grabbed a size n which is my true size and the official colorway of this shoe is Varsity red black sale muslin before we move on from the box I do want to show you guys some other really cool details that can be found inside and the first is this really cool receipt that's designed to look like an old 80s Mom and Pop Shop receipt now the first thing I noticed about this receipt was actually the price paid for this pair of sneakers and that price was $14.99 which sounds crazy now but back in August 30th of 1986 it wasn't too insane for a pair of sneakers that was on sale the receipt says Air Jordan basketball shoes paid cash final sale received by Leah n another interesting detail is that the name of the Mom and Pop Shop Sandy Bros is actually a nod to some of the designers of the Air Jordan 1 and then the other detail that I love inside the box is actually the paper so the paper is designed to look like old Jordan ads in fact I think they might have actually taken old Jordan ads collaged them together and then printed them on the paper and it's a really really cool detail I absolutely love it oh also one other detail I wanted to mention is that inside the shoes when you first get them they don't come with a cardboard insert instead they come with just paper which in my opinion is just something good to know if you're buying these sneakers in the aftermarket and you want to legit check your shoes if they have cardboard in them they're not legit but now let's get back to the sneakers themselves my most anticipated shoe of 2022 I can't believe I'm holding these it's crazy so first things first this shoe is a Chicago Air Jordan 1 the original colorway of the Air Jordan 1es the first released back in 1985 now I guess technically this shoe isn't really a true retro of the Air Jordan one Chicago it's not like the 2015 pair that was just a re-release of the original this shoe has a new story behind it it's a little bit aged it's got some cracked leather the story behind this shoe is a little bit deeper than a standard pair of chagos and because of that I'm not sure if this is like the next Chicago retro that we're going to get or if we're going to get one two years down the road that's much more standard than this pair speaking of Retros of Chicago 1es I do have the 2015 pair right here just to compare for you guys to give you guys a quick overview of how these shoes differ so as you may be able to tell the shape of these two shoes is a little bit different it seems like the 2015 pair is ever so slightly higher than the newer version of the shoe there is definitely differences in the leather on the 2015 pair you do have a lot of tumbled leather it's a pretty standard Air Jordan 1 whereas on the 2022 lost and founds you do have a lot of cracked leather which we'll get into later on in the video and then the red leather is much more stiff a lot more similar to the 1985 versions of the shoe or the recently released 1985 versions of the shoe the shades of red are very similar between these two shoes however on the 2015 pair the white panels and the white areas on the shoe are very bright white whereas on this newer 2022 lost and found version of the shoe the white portions of the shoe actually come in a much more cream or off-white color from a distance they are very similar looking shoes I mean the color way is the same the silhouette is very similar but when you start looking at these shoes up close you do notice a lot of differences but now let's dive a little bit deeper into the materials that make up the lost and found Air Jordan Ones so around the toe of the sneaker on the mud yard you've got this really nice deep Chicago red leather and like I was saying earlier the leather used on the red panels of the shoe is much more similar to the leather used on the recently released 1985 versions of the shoe it's a little bit stiffer it's not really tumbled and it actually much more closely resembles the leather used on the original release of the shoe and I actually think it's a pretty decent leather especially for $180 shoe it's not the best leather in the world but it's definitely a step up from really any of the leather that we've had on recent Air Jordan 1's it also smells really good too it smells like a leather shop it's crazy I love it moving up from the red leather panels you've got this cracked sail colored leather on the toe now I'm not usually the biggest fan of cracked leather I've said that in my amam maner Air Jordan reviews because a lot of those shoes feature cracked leather and the reason for that is because over time I found that cracked leather literally cracks off and almost looks like shoe dandruff it's kind of gross but what's nice about this is that this leather doesn't seem to be overly cracked to where it will start peeling off very quickly and also it really fits with the story of the shoe because this is what this leather would be doing after 30 plus years and also like I mentioned before this panel is not a true white but instead is much more of a sale color again to mimic the Aging of a pair of shoes it would have been satin storage for 30 plus years continuing up even farther on the shoe you've got more of these red leather panels on the ey IE stay of the sneaker and then weaving through the IE stay at least when you first get the shoe you've got a set of white laces and a set of black laces prestarted in the sneaker now one of the interesting details about this release is that unlike standard Air Jordan 1 or recent Air Jordan 1 releases you don't have lace bags instead the two sets of laces are actually woven through the bottom two eyelets of the sneaker which I'm assuming is a call back to the original releases of the shoe as you can see the shoe comes with a set of white laces and a set of black laces and I decided to just go with the black laces because that's what I usually wear with my Chicagos then underneath the laces you've got this salec colored nylon Air Jordan one tongue which I'm sure is designed to look aged at the top of the tongue you've got this red tag with the Nike Air logo embroidered into it in white and another difference that I noticed between this pair and the 2015 pair is that the font of the air teex seems to be a little bit thinner on this pair which I'm assuming again is designed to look like The Originals then moving inside the sneaker you've got this black fabric sock liner which is pretty standard for Air Jordan 1es and is also pretty well paded which I appreciate and then rounding off the inside of the shoe you've got a white insole with the Nike Air branding printed on the heel in red one other detail that I thought would be kind of interesting to mention and to show is the tag inside the sneaker now what's interesting about this tag is that it actually shows you the dates that this sneaker was manufactured and according to the tag looks like these Air Jordan 1 Chicago lost and founds were manufactured between February 23rd 2022 and May 18th 2022 which is actually a little bit earlier than I would have expected I guess it makes sense with the original October release date and it also makes sense as to why you can grab pairs of these early on goat and at Sneaker events and places like that but I am honestly kind of surprised I would have thought there would have been more leaked images of this shoe by now but there isn't but now let's get into sizing and fit which I'm sure a lot of you are wondering about so in my opinion the shape of this silhouette is kind of a mix between the recent air Jordan 1 releases and the recent Air Jordan 1 1985 it's kind of got that straighter heel line that you find on the 1985 pairs but it's also still got that sort of hunched forward look from the newer pairs it really seems like a mix of both I'm not sure exactly why they didn't decide to go one way or the other but it is what it is either way the good news is this shoe does seem to fit true to size and just like every other pair of Air Jordan ons however as I always say if you don't already own a pair of Air Jordan 1es I do suggest trying on a pair in your local Foot Locker or something like that does not have to be this colorway just to make sure that you're grabbing the right size for you especially if you're grabbing this shoe for resale also I don't know if you peep the fire socks in the on fooot portion of this video but those socks are from my sock brand Apothecary at Apothecary we create your sneakers favorite socks they're incredibly comfortable they come in a bunch of different colors and they look great with all of your sneakers so if you want to try out a pair of your sneaker new favorite socks make sure to click the link to apothecary's website in the description below continuing back on the sneaker to the midfoot you get to another sail colored cracked leather panel and of course Landing in the center of this panel you've got this black leather Nike Swoosh moving towards the heel of the shoe you've got more of these red leather panels and then on the lateral side of the sneaker you've got the wings logo in matte black now what's interesting about this wings logo is that unlike with standard Air Jordan 1es or more recent Air Jordan 1es this logo isn't debossed into the material and then filled with sort of a glossy paint Instead This wings logo is much more similar to the original Air Jordan 1es and the Air Jordan 185s in that it's embossed outward and then painted with the matte paint I actually much prefer this treatment I know it's just really a reversed version of what we usually get but I just think it looks cleaner on the shoe then moving around to the top of the ankle collar you've got this glossy black cracked leather now unlike with the white cracked leather this black cracked leather actually allows you to see through to the leather underneath in this case the leather has sort of a light brown or tan color which gives this heel area a bit more of a distressed look and I'm not going to lie when I first saw images of this shoe I was mad that they did this detail I felt like it was unnecessary there was too much going on but now that I understand the story of this shoe while I don't love this detail visually I really do think it does add to the story of the shoe and if they hadn't done this it wouldn't have really fit with the whole aesthetic then moving down on the shoe you get to your standard Air Jordan 1 midsole however this time around it doesn't come in a bright white and instead comes in sort of a cream colored sail it's actually a slightly more aged color than the leather found in the upper of the shoe which makes sense because rubber does usually yellow faster than leather and then finally getting to the bottom of the shoe you've got this Red Rubber outsole which seems to be sort of marbled with this kind of light gray color which does give the bottom of the shoe sort of a Dusty or old look which again really ties in well with the story I meant what I said at the beginning of this review this shoe for me is sneaker of the year I don't see any other release even coming close to this shoe and hey maybe I'm biased maybe I love this shoe because the Air Jordan one is my favorite sneaker of all time and the Chicago colorway while I don't love it as much as the bread Air Jordan Ones is right up there with it so yes maybe I'm biased but you have to admit that the story behind this sneaker the packaging and all the little details that went into this shoe really make this one of the best all-around sneaker releases of the entire year this sneaker is straight fire and in my opinion it deserves all the hype that it gets unfortunately because this shoe is going to be so hyped up I'm sure it's going to be very difficult to grab a pair of these for retail and the resale price of this shoe is probably going to be stupid so just keep that in mind if you want a pair of these just stay on top of all the release information and uh enter all the Raffles you can that's all the advice I can give you but at this point I would love to know your thoughts on this shoe so make sure to let me know in the comment section down below and as always

nvQEkgreaHw,what's going on guys and welcome back to the channel Today we're taking a first look at the Air Jordan 1 Union LA fragment design collab Before we get into these I want to remind you that this video and all the other content on my channel is for educational and entertainment purposes only If you're new to the channel guys go ahead and like and subscribe for me Really appreciate it It is very very helpful You can also then be sure to follow me on Instagram and Tik Tok at KB Vegas Kicks Guys I appreciate the support and we're going to dive right in these Jordan 1's This one um I have loved all the Union LA Jordan 1's Um this one a little bit different with a like co- collab with Fragment Design Um looking really good Uh I do like it Some things that I would personally have changed on the design but uh let me show you where I picked these up from guys Not a new seller from me but one I have not reviewed for in a while Uh but of course I will have all their information in the description of the video I know they'll take care of you Let's dive right in So you do have that Jordan 1 outsole It is all in this solid rubber compound white Um this is one of the things that I personally would have changed I would have gone with a um contrasted outsole to the midsole but uh the white you know some people say that makes it pop a little bit more sets it apart from the uh traditional Jordan 1 uh fragment So and I can see their point but just personally I would have liked the contrast You don't really see this much on Jordan 1's Um a solid color midsole and outsole Normally there is a contrast but at any rate uh it looks good The midsole in bright white Of course around the medial side you do have your tooling All right And stitching looks good on this pair Um normally when I hold it this way the light will hit and we can kind of see glue residue And this pair looks to be pretty clean from that Always like that pretty good Now as far as the fit and comfort of these shoes um this is the first batch run of these and um this men's 13 fits slightly small in my opinion more like a 12 and 1/2 In fact it's got a size 12 insole in it So um what I would recommend on this one guys is go ahead and asking for your insole measurements on your QC pics just to make sure Um they're not too tight on me for a 13 but not like they're not a true 13 Um so you know just be aware of that Uh they do come with a dream cell insole though so pretty comfortable on foot as far as the cushioning for a Jordan 1 Now the upper of the shoe uh pretty much just kind of like flat grainy leather is going to cover the entire upper of this one You don't there's no tumbled leather or anything like that at least not on this first batch Um but it's soft Nothing to complain about but nothing to write home about either Uh you do have a little bounce back here at the toe box Could be a little bit more sleek on the toe box but it looks nice with that black and white Um you got your perforations of course And then you get three sets of laces Um we'll take a look at that here in a minute I'll show you the different colors But then you have of course your Union LA look to the tongue where you have the stitching uh to the multiple colors You got black and then a sail hit up here Kind of a light blue stitching And then your Nike Air at the top back of the tongue Okay And then black takes care of the sock liner So on the laces um you got black going to uh white you got black going to gray and then you've got white going to black Okay so they all change colors uh midway through the lace Um so you got those three different options on this one guys Let me get that tucked back in if I can with one hand Sorry probably just should have set them down But of course you also have your exposed foam going around the edges of the tongue as expected on this one Uh again just more flat grainy leather all throughout You can see the Union LA tag Not as noticeable on this one Normally it's in that kind of yellowish orange color Uh but it is there And then that kind of light blue stitching also Uh kind of interesting because normally on that you get a contrast from the top of the shoe to the bottom but this kind of looks like the royal design anyway Um whereas normally you'd have like the royal and a different color up top or the you know Chicago and a different color up top Um so this one's a little bit different than your traditional one Got your fragment design pressed in in black There you go Better shot of it Sorry I was getting some glare on there And then the back of the shoes Um don't really have an hourglass shape on this one And you do have double stitching Could be a little bit cleaner but overall it's going to look good on foot And then the medial side Again just a mirror image of the lateral side Everything's the same with the exception of that tooling You see the code there for the fragment design Let's bring in the left one and take a look at it Just more of the same Uh note that the Wings logo does touch this stitching line right there Okay And that is like that on both pairs I didn't mention that before but does touch on both pairs Give you another shot of your Fragment logo And clean stitching all throughout Did a pretty good job on that for sure and the medial side This one again got your tooling and that bright white outsole Again very different for a Jordan 1 bounce back here We already took a look at the laces and then there's your Nike Air again Let me get this light going here and we'll take a look at the strobble on this one So you got the gray Jordan 1 strobal Extra threading tape down Of course you can see all the extra laces in there and then there's your size tag Now inside these came with some cardboard shoe tree inserts And then like we said sorry let me get that light off Dream cell insole You do have that fragment design or excuse me the um Union LA branding on the insole with the Air Jordan And although this marked as a 13 you can see right here it's actually for a size 12 Is a Dream Cell though which is my favorite for Jordan Retro so I'm at least happy about that Um and even though I am a true size 13 when I put these on foot they weren't too tight I mean I could they were noticeably smaller than my uh true size 13s but I can still wear them Maybe not with a crease protector I don't know U but again guys just ask for um your insole measurements Or you can also just ask for them to show you the back side of this Um I'm sure they'll be happy to do that just to make sure cuz my thought is if you go to a size 12 you're going to get the same exact size and everything Then a size 11 on down for some reason at size 13 Sometimes they stop at a size 12 and put a size 13 tag in it Anyway let's set them aside and take a look at the box So you do get the correct uh Union box with all the posters and the sketches from Tinker Hatfield on there Love this box One of my favorite alltime Jordan boxes I think they did a really good job with this one Very creative and looks great I've actually got some on display out here in my studio just cuz I love the box There is your 1985 Air Jordan 1 Of course you got your Nike on the back And then around here is your box label and it's going to be Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG dark powder blue black and white Inside you're going to have that co that uh Union LA tissue paper Uh no other tissue paper or stickers or anything like that Box was well protected in shipping I appreciate that Also came with the uh Jordan Union hang tag Let me show you that real quick Okay so that would have been on the right shoe hanging right there That nice plastic Jumpman and the Union branding with your silver chain of course So yeah all in all looking good Again I probably would have preferred to have a black uh or even a blue uh outsole but other than that they're looking pretty clean I think they did a good job with this one and I'll enjoy rocking them So anyway guys that's my unboxing review this Jordan 1 Union LA Fragment Collab I hope that you enjoyed the review and that it was helpful for you Let me know what you think about this pair in the comments Be sure to follow me on my other socials and be on the lookout guys cuz we got a lot more reviews coming your way,2025-06-19 08:40:09.617864 UTC
iCLHopEohVs,so these off-white Jordan 1 uncs are fake and these right here are the actual off-white Jordan one UNC so first off The Fakes go for 40 on dhk and these are pretty nice but there are some differences to watch out for you can tell that the fonts are a little off on the inside and outside of the sneaker and the second tell is the quality of materials and also the angle of the stitching compared to the inside swoosh is way off but for forty dollars with these past the eye tests,2025-06-19 08:40:09.946876 UTC
iuFN3Yi40Pk,Nike made slip-on Jordan 1es that don't have any laces and are actually golf shoes so this is what Nike calls the Jordan 1 golf mule that looks a little unusual at first and literally just doesn't have a back heel so you can step right into them aside from also not having any laces they're fully functional as a golf shoot they even say golf on the tongue get the Jordan golf logo on the insole and get the soft golf spikes on the bottom now even though they have those spikes you really can't feel them too much and could definitely just wear them casually too in fact they're really comfortable and super easy to just throw on if you're in a rush so this might be one of the best new casual shoes,2025-06-19 08:40:09.945947 UTC
DYuX9AchtV0,Jordan Ones with no laces so this is the Jordan 1 flyes that's supposedly the easiest Jordan one to put on your feet because you don't have to tie them they come with velcro straps and a zip around the heel so let's see if they really work now regular Jordan Ones are a pretty standard shoe that you tie with laces but these look like they have laces but are actually connected by a velcro strap so when you want to get them on your feet you can simply loosen the velcro and the laces appear to come off but up top you still see one more strap that actually releases into a zipper around the heel that makes it extremely easy to take your foot in and out of the shoe so when you put it all together you get the world's easiest Jordan 1 to put on your feet,2025-06-19 08:40:11.497171 UTC
NveiRvhnxlE,this is how you legit check Jordan Ones on a lot of the pairs this tissue will go past the Swiss logo and end like that when you push down on the toe you want to make sure it pops back up every single time you want to make sure the stitching looks pristine around the whole shoe next you want to make sure that the r and the D touch,2025-06-19 08:40:11.652670 UTC
oR3HgrqnxoE,I was wrong about this shoe these are the Black Phantom Travis Scott Air Jordan 1 lows this pair features a premium Black Suede and Nubuck upper with contrasting white stitching that iconic reverse swoosh on the lateral side and a traditional swoosh as well as Cactus Jack branding on the medial side the other standout details of the shoe are the Nike Air tag with Cactus Jack branding beside it on the tongue the new B design on the left heel wax laces as well as Cactus Jack and Air Jordan branding on the insoles now this pair does fit true to size as I'm a nine and a half and these are a ten and I just have a little bit of room and I have to say,2025-06-19 08:40:12.161434 UTC
NM_mH3o8K9I,fun fact a shoe that was originally released in 1949 is currently trending today in 2023 hey what's good guys my name's Chris welcome back to the official wear testers.com YouTube channel today uh I thought it might be fun to look at a shoe that's currently trending why are they trending because they're simple and classic looking but these have been around since literally 1949 but like they've even been not trending were things trending back when we were kids I mean I'm sure they were but that probably wasn't the the term used like kwis was trending Sketchers was once trending you know what I mean but like these have just kind kind of always been in the consumer Zeitgeist like this was the Adidas outlet special forever so the fact that they are actually hard to obtain in store is insane to me but there's an option for that these guys right now are available under retail believe it or not in multiple sizes over at stockx they're also available with their new Express Ship where you can just like they go straight away like no waiting for a seller to package get to you and all that stuff so they don't have to like go through all the different hands which I thought was very interesting and because of that stockx actually wanted to sponsor this video and we said cut the check stockx just introduced its new Express Ship service where items are prever verified and ready to ship immediately no waiting for a seller to package ship to a stockx hub go through its verification process get it repackaged and then sent to you the items available for Express Ship are sourced from a select group of stockx sellers the sellers do set the prices for these items but again a lot of them are under retail such as the samb OG and as a buyer if you make a purchase from one of their Express Ship items stockx will immediately send them out for an additional $10 fee and then it'll be delivered in about three business days which is awesome if you happen to be a YouTuber that reviews shoes now they did say that we can actually pick something out and buy it uh to give away so I'm going to give something away to one of you guys right now I'm going to see what they have available for Express Ship Express Ship by the way does have a little rocket logo and it literally says Express Ship right next to it so it's pretty clear which one's which oh okay red cements I love a pair of fours you guys already know that so we're going to pick our size and then check out oh my God thank you shipping provider and here we are pre verified and ready to give away so if you're interested in checking out stock X's Express Ship feature make sure that you click the link Down Below in our description box it'll head you over to stock X's website or app where you can check everything out and if you see anything that You' like you can uh go ahead and check out and just wear a helmet now as far as the samba OG is concerned uh again this is a trending sneaker that is available currently in many different places stockx being one of them if you wanted to save some cash and grab them for under retail the shoe is not Tech heavy whatsoever it was originally intended as a football sneaker and by football I don't mean like American football I'm talking about like actual football football uh apparently the shoe itself was enabling players to practice or train on icy or hard ground without ruining like a cleat and stuff like that so I do think that it's an interesting look they eventually became kind of an indoor football or soccer if you're American type of shoe and now obviously they have transitioned into something trendy but even though they have been a staple on the feet of many people for decades what do they actually feature though uh not much just to let you guys know so getting them for under retail is the move I will say for comparison purposes if you're going to compare this to something around the same price point as a Nike sneaker at least the materials here are way nicer than anything you'll get over there so there is that tech-wise though same thing there isn't much as far as the outsole is concerned I really like it but it's because it's iconic it's kind of classic and everything there's not much to it as far as gimmicks Thrills Frills all that stuff but it's there it's simple it's nice when you read about how it's supposed to like hard surfaces or icy surfaces you kind of get what this little like weird I don't even know what to call this um but it's like bumpy and not spiky but kind of so you can see where they're coming from I think that it's very cool as far as the rest of the out soole which is basically one whole piece it is a cupsole and it's on the floor so if you're looking for a minimalist Barefoot type of feel this is kind of like something that you can start off with they are not a Barefoot shoe though so they're not like foot shaped so there's not spay room and all that stuff like a zero shoe would be but again it's it's something that's very interesting cuz it's so simple it's so clean you can wear this with damn near anything and get away with it and on top of that there's so many different material options too not just colors and materials but I'm talking about literal material options so this one right here is more along the lines of the actual OG hence the OG name where we've got leather we've got suede it's all over the place the tongue though is a little bit different so we've got a very thin cut leather tongue very nice it's actual leather you could see it in the cut line and everything but some of the SAS have a football style tongue where it's a little bit longer it's elongated it's kind of like a I don't want to call it a full shin guard because it doesn't go up that high but it's a guard and everything so it's interesting remember those I'm like picturing the ones where they almost come back down on top of the laces right it goes up and then folds okay so you're saying that one yeah okay that's like the soccer version or the football version and I believe that's to attach itself to the ball not literally but like so you have a little bit more control when you're cuing you know what I'm saying like doing tricks and then kicking it and stuff so I had no idea I think that's what it's for I could be wrong this tongue is obviously not performance tongue this is just a lifestyle tongue so uh this is the more simple version but what I really like about these is that again there's many different material options so if you love leather then this is an option for you if you don't maybe you're a vegan and you don't want to wear animal products on your feet or at all there's actual like plant-based versions which is really cool so go to Adidas's website if you wanted to check out all of their different varieties and then that way you can actually Google search or search on stockx or wherever you're looking at and use the actual name so you can find the specific version that you're looking for now as far as the insole is concerned that's really the only comfort that you're getting and yes it's a cheap piece of uh if you wanted to pull it out you can if you wanted to add a little bit of comfort and maybe some torsional rigidity cuz this is one of those shoes that it's just there's nothing in there then you might want to go with a move insole if you wanted to something that is not going to lift you completely out of the shoe and everything go with one of their regular insoles which would be the performance version there is the game day and the game day Pro I would recommend the game day because the shank plate is not quite as stiff so it's a little bit softer underneath your arches and stuff if you're not used to that but if you wanted something with a little bit more cushion then you can go with there all day just know that that insole is a lot thicker than the one that comes in here so it will alter the fit it'll make the toe box a little more snug it'll also lift your heel just a little bit which some people might not like so in that case you might want to go up half a size in the sneaker however sizing for most people is going to be true to size they fit perfect I really like the way that these fit I like the way that they look too I just don't know if they work with my cankles I bet your ankles would look really good in those I don't know no you look really good in low top shoes she's biased no I appreciate your legs a shs but with all that being said thank you guys so much for watching thank you so much for being here we greatly appreciate hanging out with you guys I didn't finish saying appreciate just like cut off the word no you're just doing your best Charles Barkley I'm pretty sure that's how he would say it is it appr sure appreciate I appreciate you guys so much so thank you for being here we will catch youall on the next one so until then have a good one so we're going to pick our size and then we are going to click checkout damn okay so we're just going to pick our size add to cart and then check out Jesus gosh why does it have to bounce off me like that you're throwing that really hard you told me to my shoulder hurts that was my co shot are we good we'll do it one more time this time I think I'm going to try to catch it,2025-06-19 08:40:57.862675 UTC
3zpEa1D9lUs,yo should I turn that light on behind me let's turn that light on yo what's going on everybody welcome back to a brand new video in today's video we're going over the Adidas sambas we're gonna do a general review talk a little bit about the history and how they became popular and I'll give you guys My overall opinions and let y'all know if they're worth the hype or not so with all that being said let's get right into it now the Adidas sambas have been out for forever over 50 years when I went to pick these up to do a review for you guys I actually had a very difficult time finding them I went to store after store after Store mall after mall and I finally found them in my size so to my surprise the Adidas sambas are pretty popular right now if you don't have a lot of malls or stores near you your best bet is probably going to be online there are a bunch of sizes online so you just gotta wait for it a little bit but if you're going in person and you really like these might be a little bit difficult to find these come with the original Adidas blue box with the three straps running down I went with the size 10 and I gotta say man when I put these things on feet I was surprised not in a good way but I I feel like I could have planned for this a little bit better but it didn't really cross my mind so let me help you all out so if you guys have a wide foot I would highly recommend going up half a size but if your foot's narrow go true to size you'll be fine I think to be safe though half a size up isn't too bad just because the build on the shoe right here is very slim now the uppers of the shoe consist of a variety of materials we have white leather black leather along with this gray suede that wraps around the toe of the shoe I personally love it when there are some variations on the uppers it just makes it look a little bit nicer when you see those three stripes you already know it's Adidas classic logo I do love the hit of gold on that Samba lettering on the side and this rear heel portion kind of reminds me of the top of a back tab on a Jordan 3. come on man y'all see it I see it as far as accessories go you're not going to get any crazy laces with these they just came with the white laces the tongue features a hit of blue and this is a pretty thin leather tongue now as far as comfort goes I would give these maybe like a 7 out of ten six and a half seven out of 10. again the sambas have been out for a very long time so back in the days there wasn't that much cushion in shoes and I'm sure they've made improvements but there's nothing too crazy in terms of comfort now real quick let's talk about the popularity and kind of how these kind of came back in 2022 2023. a lot of celebrities have been rocking these like ASAP Rocky and a few other people I honestly don't keep up with celebrities what is it about the sambas that makes everyone wanna rock it I personally come from a Nike SB background that's how I got into shoes and I've never had a pair of sambas before I would always see it but these never really struck me it never had a wow factor so I never bought a pair until it was time to do a review for you guys I also heard that there's a lot of people on Tick Tock doing some outfit videos showing how to style them and honestly I should have watched a couple of those videos because I threw these on with some different fits the first time I put these on I put some Levi's on they're more of like a slim fit and I think they look all right but I think these shoes look a little bit thin on me I've seen a lot of people pull these off with baggy pants I've tried the super baggy pant look and it doesn't look that great on me but it might look good on you guys I think my favorite fit with this pair right here was my pants from aloe they do have a more wider fit a little bit more baggy look and they're pretty comfortable but just looking at it from like a bird's eye view since these are so slim I feel like my pants take up the majority of the shoe and it just looks weird from my view I prefer more of a chunkier shoes just something a little bit more bulky something that has you know a little bit more wideness to it I personally just think these look funky on me and maybe it's because of my pants or I don't even know although this is a classic Model and it is going for around a hundred dollars retail I'm sorry y'all I'm gonna have to pass I've had them for about two weeks already and I tried my best bro I wore these in the house and I was like okay over time I might understand what the hype is about them but honestly they're not it they're not it for me again I've seen so many people be able to pull these off let me know what you guys think about the Adidas sambas are these a cop or drop do y'all have a pair and am I tripping on my opinion before I film this video I went through all of my trash bags and I found the freaking receipt these are going right back to Shoe Palace man but yeah that's going to wrap up my honest review and opinions of the Adidas sambas they're just not they're just not it for me but I have seen a lot of people pull them off and they look cool on other people but that's it I hope you guys enjoyed this quick review don't forget to smash the like button and subscribe if you're not subscribed already and I'll see you guys very soon for the next video

4jmB-BNBeFU,the Adidas sambas have been everywhere for the last few years and guys I tried to hide from them I tried to escape them but I finally caved and I got two colors so let's talk about it if you're new here hi my name is Angela and I'm so happy that you clicked on this video if you love anything passion and lifestyle go ahead and subscribe to this channel I really hope you enjoyed today's video and let's jump right into it so there's a lot that I want to cover in this video about the Adidas sambus but first I just wanted to start off with showing you guys the shoes I have both colors this is the white one this is kind of a 360 view of the shoe if you haven't already seen it in person and this is the black one now this is them side by side and I do want to note that these are the samba ogs so there are different types of sambas on the website but these are the ogs so these are made out of leather and suede now I want to talk a little bit about the quality of the shoe and I must say that I was actually really impressed by the quality of the samp was so I personally do not have a lot of sneakers that have this kind of sole it's kind of the uh dark brow gum and it is so so durable now the shoe is like I said very well made and the sole is bendable so it's also very very comfy which I will talk a little bit about later on so the sambas retail for 100 USD and I honestly don't think that that's bad at all because they're very wellmade and it is made out of leather as well which you don't typically see in a lot of sneakers you don't really see that in New Balance or in Nike that often so I do feel like this is more of a premium sneaker but it has kind of the same price like other sneakers so I do feel like for the price it's very very reasonable now moving on to sizing and I think this is probably why a lot of people are watching this video to figure out sizing I will try my best to help you guys out so I am typically a size us7 I'm pretty true to size now I did get the Adidas sambus in the men's sizes so you do have them in women's sizes but I went for the men's sizes now because the Adidas sambas are unisex you can go for either a men's size and a women's size now how it works is that if you go for the men's size you size down one whole size from the men's size so in my case I'm a seven and I went for a 7 and 1/2 women's size and in the men's size it's a 6 and A2 the model of the shoe is very narrow and they're flat so I do highly recommend sizing up half a size if you have very wide feet you might even get away with sizing up a whole size but if you're really unsure about your sizing I would just recommend ordering half size up and see how that is I think that for most of people's feet that would be a great fit now talking about the Comfort level and this is a reason why I love Adidas Samba so much it's because they are super comfy now I have to admit when I first saw s Zas I just was highly influenced I just wanted these because I thought that you know I just needed them and I didn't really think or care about the Comfort level but when I got them I was so shocked by how comfy they actually are I can walk in these for hours and hours the entire day I'm just so impressed that Adidas sambas do not hurt my feet at all I actually think they the best traveling sneaker so moving on to the pros and cons I want to start off with some pros and I already shared a lot of Pros but another thing that I also really love about these shoes is that they go with everything honestly when I got them they go with my entire wardrobe so these really are my go-to sneakers I was really just planning to only get one and I really wanted the white one but when I got this I just wore it every single day with every single outfit so that's why I eventually decided to get the black pair as well another Pro is that it almost seems like these sneakers do not get dirty I've had this bear since last year and you honestly can't see any wear end hair and that's like that's pretty rare because these are still wide sneakers yes they have a lot of other contrast colors but it is mostly a white sneaker the same with the black ones and yes they're black but I actually wore them out on December Nights in San Diego and it had rained a little bit so it was quite muddy and I was so scared that I would ruin my sambas that was actually the first time when I was wearing these and coming back home and the next day I looked at them and I was like why do they still look brand new now moving on to cons everyone and their mother has a pair of sambas at this point it's not something that I love but for me personally because I get so much wear out of these I don't mind I still love them I don't get sick of them but it is definitely a con to just go out and see 10 other people wearing a pair of sambas now another con is that even though a lot of people own these shoes it's actually still hard to get your hands on these but they're usually sold out online and sometimes in store they're just not available in my size so I still don't think that this is a shoe that is super easy to get it's not as hard as it used to be but there're still kind of a hard to get you in my opinion now what I recommend the Adidas sambas 100% yes there is a reason why I got them in two colors I really only wanted to get one color and also because I really needed a white shoe I went for this one first but then as soon as I got this one I really wanted the black one and I'm so happy that I did I honestly don't think you can go wrong with any of these colors and if you have a capsule wardrobe I am telling you these will be your workhorses because they're going to go with every single outfit and they're just a class and an amazing shoe as always I have linked the shoes in the description if you want to check it out I hope they are in stock and your size I really hope this video was helpful let me know down in the comments which color you prefer the white somus or the black somus and also I would really appreciate it if you can like this video it helps me out so so much now I hope you all have a great day and I'll see you in the next video bye,2025-06-19 08:40:58.432749 UTC
hmoSDyB7G6k,"i think every single person in the world is wearing sambas right now but are you wearing the right pair all the big companies have their regular shoes and then they also have their made for skateboarding styles like Nike Dunk and Nike SB Dunk converse has Chucks and like the Converse Con's Chucks i almost got into a huge argument trying to sell some skating chucks on Facebook and I priced them higher than normal Chucks because they are and some lady was coming at me in the comments saying I was trying to scam people cuz Converse don't cost that much and she didn't know that they were skating Converse and she's replying to every single comment being like ""Don't buy it they're a scam."" So that just tells me that people don't understand whether it's skating versions if they're supposed to be better or not but the sambas like these two pairs are almost identical in every way and feeling so David Blu tile sent these to us and he was saying even he wasn't sure the exact differences luckily we can cut them in half and really expose what's going on inside so for that one guy who's always commenting collab with David Blue Tile win there you go it finally happened so the difference is minimal so I'm going to go through layer by layer to tell you what the real difference is and then I'll do a little like skating review and how it actually feels at the very end so if we go to the boot info so the brand is Adidas the style is Samba OG uh they weigh 12.2 ounces they retail for $100 and they're made in Vietnam uh the positioning on the website says ""Born on the pitch the Samba is a timeless icon of street style this silhouette stays true to its legacy with a tasteful lowprofile soft leather upper suede overlays and gum soul making it a staple in everyone's closet so I'm going to call this one the OG from here on out it's the non-skating version if we go to the other version so this is the Adidas the style is the Samba ADV uh they weigh 12.2 oz and they retail for $100 so exactly the same as the other one the positioning on the website of this one says ""An indoor football staple adapted for skateboarding by Adidas the Samba ADV shoes feature an upgraded T-to design with two layers of Atti tough toe reinforcement allowing feel flick and durability known for its locked and fit the molded sock liner and signature tongue wings create a stabilizing fit while the grippy cups ensures the feel and board control so there's a lot of marketing jargon going on in there uh upgraded ttoe attit so let's dive into it so first off the fit and feel these literally feel the exact same on your feet so if we go to the leather um on the OG one it has full grain leather upper with gritty suede and gold foil details and the ADV it says it has a leather and suede upper so both have pretty heavy finishes on them the OG definitely feels like stiffer and chintzier than the ADV so let's start the actual test to see if there's any difference so the thickness of the suede the OG comes in about 1.4 mm 1.45 mm thick and the ADV comes in at about 1.5 mm thick so they're pretty dang close especially for suede so I cut the toe off both shoes to see if they're actually double layered or just fakes and surprisingly both shoes are truly double layered like you'd want to see that in the skating one to get doubled layers but to have it in just the normal general release like having it actually be a double layer is super surprising and you almost never see that in any company ever super good for skating huge bonus for non-sking so that's pretty good now if you go to the leather the OG it's 1.5 mm thick but the ADV is 1.6 mm thick so slight edge to the skating ADV but if we go to the macro of the finish you can see some differences cuz in the OG it's a heavily PUcoated leather it has a very embossed pattern to make it look like real leather if you go to the ADV it's PUcoated leather but it's a little softer and more tumbled and malleable it's less of an embossed finish as well jeff Mic the New Balance designer was saying that sometimes the PU coating makes it a little more durable for skating but it all depends on the actual leather itself so he took it to the burn test on the OG you can see the coating burns off and it kind of shrinks and flakes away but it is still real leather it's not just you know plastic coated garbage on the ADV the coating melts a little bit and then flakes off to reveal real leather so they're about similar on that but if we do a macro of the grain grain is like the fiber structure that holds the shoe together the tighter the fibers are like up on the skin and it gets loose into suede so it's like it goes nice to not as nice so on the OG there's no grain at all it's just a PUcoated suede so it stretches really easily it's just not a super nice leather it's pretty much just like a bunch of groundup suede with a PU coat laid over on top of it if you go to the ADV there's also either no or very little grain it stretches but it stretches less than the white since it's slightly thicker but then if we run the puncture tests on it the OG punctures at 120 lbs and the ADV only punctured at 59 lbs i don't know if you can tell but like the ADV is so like malleable and stretchy it feels good and this one's just like stiff and tough and kind of chintzy so I guess that's where the puncture tests are getting that like crazy variation so is the ADV actually upgraded for skating i'm going to say yes the leather on the OG is pretty bad quality the white leather is just drier it feels worse the suede is much drier on the OG so softer more malleable leather will be better for skating it'll just like mold to your foot better and faster and just feel less chintzy than the light layer what is it that you guys have been asking us for non-stop blood core belts look at that so super limited quantities these are a pain in the butt to make and so get them before they're gone you know you're going to be a little bit of the testing batch so we'll we'll I'd appreciate some feedback how to make this work better cuz this basically the boot thickness leather doubled up sewn together with our classic solid brass buckle that's not the only brand new thing that we released so we finally released all the wallets including the Clayton and Blood Core you can see that the edges are not nearly as bright it's cuz we have to burnish them but that'll start popping out more as you wear it too just like the actual Bloodcore concept is but there's more cuz we finally People This is another thing people like ""Hey we want to buy Bloodcore."" So we got little baby panels and we got the big daddy panels and then you obviously got the boot pocket kit you got coasters you got the little bracelets you got the ring kits so limited quantities get them before they gone especially limited quantities on these and cuz it's just a trial run we're we're we're learning how to do this with this leather and so it's a little bit of a trial run thank you guys for your support of Bloodcore you can only get it from us and we finally opened it up to a belt and all of our wallets so check them out below so if you move to the inside they both have the same fake leather collar and leather lining you get your typical textile sneaker lining so nothing special on either of them but if you go to the insole the OG it has a removable open cell foam like it's got all the glue strap and but if you go to the ADV it's also a removable open cell foam but it's much denser and like you can see that it holds its shape a lot more but if you put the durometer to it you can see that the OG comes in at about 10 sh which is really soft and the ADV comes in about 25 sh so it's definitely harder and denser um it'll make it a lot better for impact absorption while skating it's still super thin and it feels like nothing on your feet it will last longer and compress a lot less quickly than the OG so is the ADV actually upgraded for skating i would say slight but yes i would rather have this insole than this one for the long term moving to the outsole so on the website Adidas calls the OG outsole a gum rubber cups and the ADV a flexible rubber cups but they look exactly the same same tread pattern same everything feel about the same so back to the hardness test to see if there's any difference at all so the OG comes at about 75 shor which is pretty hard for a sneaker um like usually you see it in like the 50 to 60 range for like a mass-produced sneaker like this but the ADV comes in at 65 Sh which shows that it is actually softer than the OG so the pros and cons of that so a harder outsole is going to last way longer but it's going to be more slippery a softer outsole will be way grippier and more flexible but it's definitely going to wear down faster than a super hard rubber outsole like that now if you throw them on the puncture test the OG punctures at 131 lbs and the ADV punctures at 108 lb so is the ADV actually upgraded for skating on the outsole I'd say yes the softer outsole is definitely better for skating it's kind of at the cost of some longevity but I'd rather have a softer grippier outsole than a harder more durable outsole specifically for skating so far the ADV is looking slightly better for skating but it's still quite minimal so let's cut it in half to see what else Adidas might be hiding in there and see you know the full story of what's actually going on all right so got them cut in half uh make sure to go check out David Bluetile he runs Blue Tile Skate Shop in South Carolina he has a YouTube channel where he shows off all the shoes that he gets so if you want to go check out a pair of the skate helas go buy them from his shop i think that'd be sick so let's see what's inside all right so there's actually three big things in here that make the ADV actually upgraded for skating so under the leather on the ADV is a piece of rubber so technically you can see that the ADV is actually triple layered so you got layer of suede layer of grain leather and then layer of pretty thick attit rubber reinforcement right there but I want to see how big it is so I actually cut off the whole upper and it's actually huge it's like the full toe on one side and weirdly enough is it's asymmetrical on the inside of your foot it tapers down to just where the toe suede is but on this side it's the whole foot all the way to the stripes so that's actually a pretty smart idea because you know on the inside of your shoe you're definitely not going to get as much wear for skating as on the outside of your shoe where you flick and ollie the second thing is that the ADV tongue has about double the amount of foam as the actual OG it's kind of hard to tell while you're wearing it and skating in it like now that I have it cut in half and I can see the foam I'm like ""Oh yeah there is definitely more foam in there."" A big foamy tongue is like a staple of skate shoes like just ask Andrew Reynolds he loves that huge DC Links puffy tongue uh especially if you grew up in like the early 2000s and the 90s a big puffy tongue makes it a skate shoe so this is just you know there's a little extra foam in there it's not huge but it'll definitely make a little difference if you're skating for a long time third and most important difference is how it's constructed while the OG Sombra does have a double toe cap you can see that the grain leather stops before the outsole and the suede is actually what's holding the top to the outsole it's kind of a copout so if you were to skate a non-skate version shoe you'd flick a couple times blow through the suede and then your whole shoe would be opening up and hanging loose on the ADV you can see all three layers go down into the outsole it makes it way more durable it's just way better of a construction but it's definitely like the suede is the weakest part of the leather on the shoe comparatively so what you all have been waiting for is the actual skating analysis so it feels like you're wearing a leather sock it literally just conforms to your foot so the suede toe stitching bust fairly quickly it held on for about 3 weeks before totally ripping off and like chipping away um it would be way worse if it was just one layer like if this was your shoe and you had one layer and a buster be like ""Well that sucks."" But this one has I still have the leather and the attitu toe so that's definitely a sick skateboarding upgrade and you can see on the leather I didn't even go through the leather i haven't even made it to the Attitough yet and this is skating for about 3 weeks or so there's super minimal cushioning like this is as much if not more board feel than a regular Vulk shoot when I'm doing my middle kick flips there's times that I landed and my toe would like curl around the board so it's it's a cupsole but it feels really really really thin um I was just skating the Andrew Reynolds 933 and then going to this was like a whole different world it was like cushioning foam good stuff and then just like oh here's a sock with some rubber on it that you can skate so that definitely made my feet and knees ache a little bit since there's no cushion at all that's just the column rubber outsole right there the outsole it's super grippy uh it felt really solid to skate in i didn't put any holes in it like you can see where I was flicking it started to kind of chip off around the toe but no holes in the bottom it's definitely wearing through a little bit on my toes where I like pivot but other than that the outsole held up really well like it kind of reminds me of like a last resort where it breaks in a ton but then it just kind of hits this plateau where it doesn't get too soggy like for the first few times I was wearing it I was like ""Oh this is good oh it's breaking in a lot oh I don't know if I like this."" And then it just kind of stopped it was like if it broke in anymore I think I would be like ""This is too soft and too soggy for me."" But it just kind of hit a point and stop which is kind of sick so overall it's a pretty decent skate shoe especially if you have a board feel over cushioning uh I definitely wouldn't be jumping down a bunch of stair sets or anything in this they definitely make your feet hurt a little bit just because there's no cushioning but that's kind of what this shoe is for so if you're jumping down big stuff I'd avoid it but if you're just skating like especially if you're like a ledge skater or like super tech guy I feel like these are going to be super sick for you so as overall I think you should absolutely buy the ADV sambas over the OG sambas if anything just for the construction most skate shoe models are like $10 to $20 more expensive but these are literally the same price so why doesn't Adidas just make them all this way cuz they're actually better and will definitely last longer than these i don't know crazy they're the same price yeah literally just get the skating version it's way better like Nike SBS are like 20 bucks more now and Converse are like $25 more for the skating versions just buy the skating versions of Sombas if you're going to buy Sombas that is my plea to you I suppose so let me know what else you guys want to cut i want to do some more Adidas skate shoes but like I don't know there's so many different models like do you guys want to see the Tyon the Superstar Advinates let me know i've also started like a skating testing pool so if you have any opinions on shoes you've skated or like you want to get your clips in the video of shoes that are coming up you can sign up for that below i'll reach out if we do a video and hit you up and kind of see what you think about it i guess that's it so see you",2025-06-19 08:40:58.999228 UTC
jqSLxWHhI_Y,this is one of the most popular Adidas shoes of all time second only to the Stan Smiths and with celebrities like ASAP Rocky Kendall Jenner and Haley Bieber wearing them all throughout 2022 their popularity has exploded to the point where throughout early 2023 there were shortages and you couldn't find these so we're going to cut these things in half run to our test to finally figure out why they've been around for 74 years how they've sold 35 million pairs why a football sneaker is suddenly one of the most popular sneakers and is this shoe still built to the same standard equality that built the samba name that's lasted 74 years when we were preparing this video I had no idea that this shoe had been around 74 years and the history is actually pretty interesting because it all starts in 1924 when Adolf and Rudolph dossler registered the name this because I'm not gonna just I'm not gonna butcher it or in English the dossler brothers Shoe Factory in Bavaria Germany then in 1928 Runner Linda Reiki won Gold in Amsterdam wearing a pair of dasler shoes 1933 unfortunate the dossler brothers were part of the thing that was going on in that country don't want to get demonetized by YouTube by talking about history but under this new government their business thrived and was able to grow rapidly and then in 1936 the infamous Berlin Olympic Games many of the German athletes were wearing the dosser Brothers Shoes along with American track star Jesse Owens who won Gold and wore the dosser track shoes during the medal ceremony which catapulted it out of the smaller Market of Germany and really brought it into the mainstream worldwide then just a couple years later World War II starts and the brothers shoe factories were converted into munition factories for the German military and Rudolph was drafted to fight but when AWOL as he thought his brother Adolf was trying to steal the company away from him and then in April of 1945 American troops were poised to destroy one of their big factories but they were convinced not to because of how big of fans they were of Jesse Owens and the shoes he wore and they didn't want to destroy they wanted to take some shoes back home with them and then in 1949 the dossler brothers relationship suffered even more to a point where there's a permanent Rift and Adolf okay Addie dossler started Adidas ADI Adidas Adidas and then Rudolph dossler started a rival company Puma which doesn't have any phonetic similarities and then in 1949 Adidas decides to make a new football shoe which was originally designed to help footballers train on icy and hard grounds and that is the predecessor to the samba which didn't wasn't called the samba because during the 1950 FIFA World Cup in Brazil Adidas tried to gain popularity in South America by giving that newly invented football shoe it's now a popularized name the samba then over the next several decades the samba became a staple product for Adidas that continued to be sold year after year to anybody from footballers to Skaters to athletes streetwear casual wear and just about anything you can think of mostly due to the versatility and the alleged quality per dollar spent and then fast forward to 2023 like I mentioned in the beginning of this video this shoe is completely exploded and popular just look at this graph on Google Trends it's crazy how popular it's become and I think the vast majority of people had no idea this shoe has been around for 74 years so what does this shoe well if the brand is Adidas the style is a Samba OG it weighs they retail for a hundred dollars they are made in Vietnam and the way the Adidas positions this shoe is born in the pitch the samba is a Timeless icon of street style the silhouette stays true to the Legacy and the tasteful low profile soft leather upper suede overlay gum sole making it a staple in anyone's closet on and off the pitch but anytime I hear a shoe that has this long of a history and it's this popular because of the quality and why people love it so much and it's been 74 years I get worried that the quality has dropped to increase the margins to get this popular shoe that built its name because of its quality they use that to sell a subpar shoe to the people who think it's something that's not which we've seen maybe 30 times with some of these old school sneakers so let's start looking at the details of the shoes starting with the upper first because we've seen a lot of these hundred dollar ish range shoes that look like they're made of full leather but as soon as you put the lighter to them and start looking at the fine details there's usually like one or two panels that's real leather and the rest is just terrible fake leather so we put the lighter to each of the panels and the toe bumper is real the vamp panel is real the lace stays are real the tongue itself is real the quarter panels are real and the only thing that's not real leather on the outside of the shoe is the heel stay and the little black accents of the Adidas Stripes so pretty impressive for a hundred dollar shoe because it's really rare to see any shoe that's one made by one of these big corporations that has all leather all the way through the upper let alone a hundred dollar shoe but what is the quality of this leather well it's it's pretty on par with the rest of the big Brands Leathers it's 1.5 millimeters thick we looked at the cross section there's just a little bit of grain in there you can also tell with the macro lens that it has a little bit of a fake embossed print into it and the thing I don't like about this style of leather is you can see because of that heavy layer of plastic on top it automatically looks like it's all wrinkled and gross because of that heavy plastic coating and we also ran the puncture test on it and it performed really well at 120 pounds so honestly first thing we looked at it's quite impressive with the samba having actually full leather through the majority of the shoe the only thing that's not leather is the little black accents but what about the inside of this shoe well just when I was had my hopes up this is all leather it is a super high quality all the way through put the lighter to the lining and the lining is fake leather and so is the tongue backer which is not that crazy you know with this much leather at 100 bucks it's already pretty impressive but I hate this fake leather because it's it is just plastic and so it's like having a plastic bag around your foot it doesn't breathe and it causes chafing if it's on your bare skin because it's they're just plastic and then looking deeper inside the shoe you've got a pretty typical lining for the rest of the shoe up near the vamp and if we pull this insole out it is a it's about as cheap of an insole as you get like it might as well not even be there because of how open cell the foam is it's it just bottoms out immediately then the lasting material it looks like it's a more rigid and more structured lasting material than what we use usually see with sneakers which starts to make me think this might actually still be somewhat of a performance sneaker and then if we look at the outsole this is where the shoe is the most interesting to me because it has really deep lugs and it has a really unique pattern these little saw teeth a little pivot point that allegedly these little things are suction cups and it's a pretty hard outsole too it's a 60 Shore a so pretty tough compared to majority sneakers that are usually like 40 to 50 short a but I wanted to see how well this outsole performed so we did the ball and bar drop test and the bar drop it bounced up 5.3 inches which is like pretty average maybe on the lower end and then the ball drop bounced up just under 12 inches which not amazing either so it seems like it's pretty on par with other shoes but I don't think it's made to be a responsive foam based rebound shoe and we also did the puncture test just for fun and it took 131 pounds which is pretty impressive for a sneaker especially a really simple traditionally made sneaker and so everything's looking like it's a pretty decent sneaker especially for 100 bucks all leather rubber a pretty sturdy outsole all but you never know to be cut in half so let's cut this in half see if there's anything else hiding and really judge the sneaker and see why it's been around for 74 years so you know how your wallets look like complete trash after like two to three months after buying it the reason it falls apart is the same reasons that your cheap sneakers fall apart because cheap sneakers and cheap wallets use cheap leather really thin thread lots of BS marketing and usually they're backed with fabric because of how weak that really terrible leather is versus high quality Footwear and our handmade wallets we use premium leather with the grain plenty of thickness in there we use a really thick stitching no gimmicks literally just leather and thread no fabric backers anywhere and it only gets better with time because we use such high quality leather it develops this unique patina that ages and wears in to get some beautiful highlights and low lights and depth depth of color and it shapes to fit your cards perfectly so check out our handmade wallet see the link in the description especially this one this is the spb wallet and since this is a sneaker video the reason it's called the SBB is because I designed this pattern when we cut apart the shattered backboard Jordans and made a wallet out of them and it's just been really popular ever since so thank you guys for checking out these wallets and our belts and all the other products we make and supporting this channel it means a lot to me so thank you guys foreign we got it cut in half and if you're not subscribed consider doing it it's how we pay to do this twice a week every single week pay the editors pay for everything that we do it's because of your guys support So if you're not subscribed consider doing it and if you are subscribed thanks for all your support so let's see what's inside so before cutting this in half I just assumed that all the bad stuff everything was hidden on the inside to get it down to the 100 price point but it's surprising what's on the inside because you have a true toe cap for once in sneaker history that so many sneakers pretend like they have a true toe cap but this one actually does and that makes sense it's a soccer sneaker you want that extra protection from kicking balls all day and the other thing is this outsole is really really thick it's six to seven millimeters thick all the way across which is double the thickness of Marquez brownlee's sneaker it's a couple millimeters thicker than the vast majority of sneakers and I think it is because it's a performance sneaker and the whole construction of the shoe and every little detail about it is about as simple and paired down as you can make a shoe and now to the questions that I want to answer from this video why have these been around for 74 years well I think the sneaker is a really good example of my probably everyone's Grandpa's favorite expression kiss keep it simple stupid no fluff no gimmicks just high quality materials that are thick and they do the job how they're supposed to do it why have they sold 35 million pairs well not all great Shoes sell millions and millions of pairs but shoes that are sold at a pretty decent price of 100 bucks that are built to this quality that customers can rely on because I think that's the biggest point of why I sold 35 million because I don't think you sell that many by just selling one to each individual I think there's a lot of people out there that have bought several of these in their lifetime and then turn other people on to them and have their kids buy them and I think it's the only way you can get to the number two spot of all Adidas sneakers and then why is a football sneaker suddenly one of the most popular sneakers of the year I honestly don't know because I don't think most people know how good this shoe is I think it was just a trendy thing on social media currently and the thing about where we're at now is Trends rise so fast but they also drop really fast so something get popular overnight but it can die overnight and when it does get popular it's not that slow creep that was all through the 80s and 90s and 2000s it's overnight so I think that's the vast majority of why they're so popular I don't think it has anything to do with the quality I think it's just how social media works is the shoe built to the same standard equality that built the samba name over the last 74 years well they are clearly pretty good Sneakers but I'm willing to bet that the previous versions were even better because if you didn't know these used to be made out of kangaroo leather which if you don't know kangaroo leather is arguably the strongest leather in the world at this thickness of 1.5 millimeters but unfortunately it is Adidas decided to quit making shoes out of kangaroo leather in 2012. maybe they have some good reasons but it would have been cool to actually have this made out of kangaroo and then finally is this a good sneaker is it worth the money it's definitely not the best sneaker we've ever cut in half but for an old school traditional sneaker I don't think there's a better one that we've cut apart that's in this price range of around 100 bucks and I think that most people that buy this sneaker are going to get their money's worth out of it which is really rare these days especially for these big Brands which really surprised me because when we were planning this video I thought for sure that this video is gonna be dumping all over sambas just like all the other traditional sneakers that have this Heritage and lineage where the brands have slowly nickeled and dimed and cut Corners away to increase those margins so it's just a carcass a facade of the former shoe that built the name but fortunately this is a rare instance of that not being the case because this is a pretty decent sneaker for 100 bucks so let me know what you guys think and if you've owned a pair of these and especially the kangaroo ones I'm curious what you thought of One Versus the other so put that in the comments and thank you guys for all your support and watching these videos it's really fun to do and show you guys what you're spending your hard earned money on instead of just guessing and hope that they work out so thank you guys see ya oh [Applause] foreign,2025-06-19 08:40:59.099163 UTC
Wrnkykah6wc,all of these brands are doing like twists on Classics we just did the air more Up Tempo how they with those and made them kind of cooler in my opinion and Adidas doing the same thing man they took the samba which is already you know it's a cool shoe I think it's all right it's a little too thin for me but they beefed the out of it and hot damn this reminds me of 2000 skate era stuff this is awesome hey what's going on guys my name is Chris welcome back to the official wear testers.com YouTube channel today we got a detailed look and breakdown of these bad boys right here this is the Adidas Samba xlg they smell so good if you just had these in your hand so you could touch and feel the leather that's on this for 110 bucks you would go and grab your nearest Air Jordan one and

up to 40% on your purchase with the link Down Below in our description box you're welcome in advance all right so first off these guys we already established are 110 bucks super affordable I'm sure that you can find certain colorways available right now for under that I actually just grabbed another colorway it's more of the classic Samba version so it's just the white with the black stripes and actually got 30 bucks off of those things I can't remember where I'm pretty sure it was WSS it's actually where I got these from too I grabbed this pair in store and uh when you sign up for their like you know the program or whatever you like accumulate points and I got 30 bucks off so yeah actually it might have been full longer actually I think it was dicks yeah what's going on with my brain why can't I remember anything anymore like what's happening at least you realize that you're forgetting it pisses me off I normally remember everything so delete all that I'm pretty sure or does it it doesn't even matter it doesn't matter at all it doesn't even matter I don't know why I get stuck on this stuff what am I even talking about you haven't even said the cutest part what about getting these shoes what about them you had a father daughter bonding moment oh they don't care it was still cute I got to witness it how was it cute because I just took her shopping I know and she paid for her own St she paid for her own stuff I was proud of she didn't even attempt to ask if we would pick up the check she bought two pairs know she bought these and the campuses she got the color W of these that I wanted so you can be T I think over at Dicks now I'm confused you guys didn't see any of that stuff hopefully hopefully I hope not I said delete it so yeah we'll see what happens but anyways where do I go from here I'm not sure how about we just start at the bottom so these guys actually feature the same traction pattern as the regular version of the Samba but it's attached to this bigger chunkier cupsole so the original version is also a cupsole but that is actually or at least it was originally an indoor performance shoe for the game of football also known as soccer if you're here in the States this one not so much this looks like aing skate shoe bro like this I love it I think that this is the coolest damn thing I think I've seen in a hot minute from Adidas not from the basketball side like just from lifestyle perspective but yeah this cupsole is awesome it's thick it's gum rubber which ising great and again this outsole is based off of the original performance outsole so I think that's really cool too it's paying homage to its Heritage without leaving anything behind you know what I mean like this is not a cheaper version of the shoe or a dumb down version of the shoe if anything this is kind of a better version of the original I just think it's crazy and again that thick chunky cupsole is awesome it looks great and inside of that cupsole is an Eva wedge that's the one thing where they'll differ from something like the air Jord one like something that's similar to this you know what I mean but can you feel that air so unit that's inside of the cupole of an Air Jordan 1 the answer is no so yeah I think that tech for tech when we're comparing this to like an Air Jordan 1 there's really no contest this blows that shoe out of the water I'm talking about the OG low version of the Jordan 1 to I'm not even talking about the cheap version of the Jordan 1 that retails close to this one like around that 110 to 120 range like those are not even comparable to these material wise like those feature garbage leather this features real leather I can't believe what that brand gets away with now the materials on these are just amazing for their price so the materials are not premium by any means but it's very nice leather you can smell it it's again not premium but it's real that's a real Cow's Ass right there wrapped around that last and it's awesome the overlays are going to be all different depending on the color way this particular one features suede on the stripes as well as the toe you also have a little bit of suede right there at the rear this is cool as too this little rib thing this is also pointing towards Adidas's Heritage like if you go towards their uh Continental 80s and stuff like that like very similar dude it looks it ad does some of the best work with their own design language than maybe any brand hot take maybe but I'm talking about like when you look at an Adidas you know it's an Adidas but yeah all the materials on here are fantastic there's multiple different colorways all of them are a little bit different some of them are better some of them are just again different some are all sueded everything like I saw all black pair that's actually the first pair of these that I noticed I saw them on shelves at a Shoe Palace and I picked them up like immediately cuz they again remind me of skate shoes dude they remind me of like some Globes or some DCS and I was like bro these are sick what is this you know what I mean like it was dope and they were just a straight up all black suede upper fire I'm in love I'm in love and I don't care who knows it now they also switched up the tongue but again still playing up their Heritage so if you remember in our other Samba video like the actual Samba I had noted that there's multiple different tongue versions of that shoe some are performance- driven some are lifestyle driven this is kind of a blend of both so it's got the ribs on there that is like the performance version of the tongue but it's shaped more like the lifestyle version and then on top of that they puffed it up again kind of like a skate shoe and with today's fashion trends moving more towards that late '90s early 2000s aesthetic with you know the baggy clothes and stuff like that you know making it comeback this just fits right in with all that stuff I think it's a great move the inside liner is the one thing that I don't love this particular one is that vinyl material I I just don't like it it doesn't feel good on your skin if you happen to wear no shows and then on top of that it doesn't last very long like this type of material is inside of a lot of my original rebok Iverson shoes and that stuff just it deteriorates like crazy so not my favorite thing I wish it was just a regular liner but outside of that that's really my only complaint that's High Praise is the insole a piece of well yes it is it's also really heavily glued in there so it's hard for me to get out so I'm just going to leave it but if you can take it out you can replace it with anything else that you'd like as far as sizing is concerned they do fit true to size so whatever you typically wear that is what I would recommend grabbing I would highly recommend going in store somewhere I seen these all over the place whether it be Foot Locker Dick Sporting Goods WSS or again I got these and any other like chain retailer they should have something like this on shelves just try it on see if you like it that's what I did I kept seeing them and being like Oh those are cool those are cool those are cool it took me like five times to try them on and then I finally was like wow these are dope but with all that being said what's today's question of the day what is the scariest weirdest story jod has ever told you it might have been the shark one that one sticks out in my mind like I think about this regularly and I shouldn't about that specific story about it going into the the river and then eating children we covered this in our podcast I can throw up the thumbnail here but you had told me about it before the podcast too and I don't like that like I just I just don't like it man I I already don't like going into the ocean I know that they could wash them up on shore and just you know got you like all that I don't like it and the fact that they could get into fresh water and be like cool you know I'm just like dude I just don't with that stuff man I just don't that is for real like that can really happen well that was the whole point of the history of that was prior to those five attacks Americans thought sharks were like dolphins like completely harmless wrong you know what I mean like man yeah like it's just crazy to think that like like you're already not safe in the ocean but like to think that they can like you know come up on just especially if your river is kind of murky like the Sacramento River is not clean that's the thing also in those stories uh the shark was spotted a couple times even by the people who were attacked their brains could not comprehend a shark being in the river so their brains went and said oh that's a log yeah something else yeah that's what I'm saying like mm just the thought of it gives me theing heebie jeebies we like I'm like I don't want to go anywhere in people ask me all the time you want to go to the river no I know he humors me and goes to the lake like one per year and I don't even like that when we go to the beach he walks to the water's edge and is like I'm cool y That's pretty you know what I mean like I don't with that stuff man like it's just it's not for me yeah I'm a land mammal period when I was really little I've always wondered but I don't know how to maybe maybe somebody on here will know it my parents watched a movie I want to say it was kind of in black and white and there was some crazy in my brain it's black and white okay but the scene that I remember seeing up on the TV was and I'm pretty sure it was a shark it could have been a whale and it was not Pino it was a liveaction movie but they had this creature had swallowed multiple people and the people to stay alive were floating inside of Barrels in this large fish's stomach and I don't know what movie it is that had to have been a whale and that kind of sounds familiar but I don't know what it's not Pinocchio I promise everybody it's not Pinocchio I don't know you know you know what movie this is a tangent but what movie really me up from from water like before the shark thing was piranhas bro I've never seen that yeah like that like they was in a swimming pool I don't even know how they got in there but it was not cool to watch and I was a very little kid and I was like never ever so yeah but anyways what was the question oh it was a okay it was a personal sorry my bad thank you so much for being here thank you so much for hanging out with us we greatly appreciate it we catch you guys in the next one so until then yall have a good one I got so sidetracked by everything look at this hoodie bro it's so fire did you want to see it up close real quick look at how premium just the Garment is alone and then you got this jersey style like stitched on there and then the colors pop oh my goodness it's so good it's almost hoodie season it since apparel stay

hS8SsgdHg2o,this shoe right here is probably one of the most popular shoes on the market right now and I can see why it's good zakaragi back at it again and today we have another episode of toilet reviews the series where I push you on a toilet then review it for all of you guys out there so for today's episode we have these guys right here so these are the Adidas Samba OG in the classic black colorway so very trendy and classic shoe right here so without further Ado guys let's see if these are worth the hype let's get straight into the review so these are tick tock's favorite shoe right now you've probably seen a million how to style videos or reasons why you should be buying these for summer 2023 so they're widely seen as a trendy fashion shoe and I believe a lot of popularity and hype behind the shoe comes from a lot of big name celebrities seen wearing these as well as so many dope collabs that have used this shoe like the sporty and Rich and kid collaboration with Clarks as well but what a lot of people actually don't know about this shoe that it has a rich history dating back to the late 40s when it was initially released as a football shoe or boot I don't know exactly what to call it maybe you football players can correct me in the comments down below but it was released as such for the 1950s FIFA World Cup in Brazil where it actually got its inspiration for its name because the samba is a type of music genre slash type of dance originating from Brazil so Adidas named the shoe the samba to appeal to the people of Brazil for the World Cup and that's how it got its major popularity back then because it was an instant classic so that's sort of a condensed history lesson for you guys there I really suggest looking up the full history of the shoe because it's awesome and it's a really great story but I just think it's crazy that all these years later the shoe is still so popular and it's actually stated Adidas's roster from back then all the way until now so that's just amazing now moving on to the materials and it's very basic as it features a full grain leather upper on the underlay as well as some suede overlays on the toe area you'll also notice the classic three stripe and Samba branding on the side of the shoe so the leather and suede used feel very soft to the touch making it comfortable on foot and they both have good quality actually and because of how good the materials are this just makes the shoe way more versatile in my opinion so if you want to dress this shoe up or down so if you're going for that more elevated look versus that more casual athleisure look this shoe has got you covered so let's just makes the shoe more worth it for me to buy in my opinion at least and especially over other trendy shoes like the Nike Dunk for example because that shoe had terrible quality materials guys like some of the leather they use on those shoes just felt like cheap plastic on foot but just like many older models cushioning wasn't very prevalent due to the lack of tech in the shoes and that's exactly the case with the Adidas Samba so what we have here is just a rubber cups soul and an insole that's all you're getting for cushioning and although it's not the greatest it's no different from a Nike donk or Converse Chuck Taylor or even a pair of Vans old school so you'll probably wear it anyways and get used to the feeling but if you really wanted to you could always replace the insoles within the sambas and replace it with a very comfortable insole or orthotic just to make the shoes more comfortable for your liking moving along to the outsole we have that traditional Samba traction pattern that made it so popular with all the football players and it was initially designed with the harsh European winter in mind and finally for fit they do feel narrow but I went through the sides on these so I'm normally a 10 that's what I got with the sambas and they fit me just fine but wide Footers try these on because you might want to go a half size up but overall guys moment of truth I personally don't think these are worth the hype unfortunately to me it's just such a basic and simple shoe there's really nothing special about it at all unless you're getting the collaboration pairs but even then all you're getting from those pairs are slightly better materials different colorways and just a higher price tag so all in all guys just not worth it for me in my opinion so I am happy however that this shoe is now in the Limelight because it's replacing the Nike Dunk and New Balance by 50 finally so we're finally over that era of shoes into the new era with the Adidas sum of OG's back here so let me know what you think about these in the comments down below do you think that they're worth the hype comment down below and let me know so for that point of the video guys now it's time for hashtag zacharagi today guys I have the Adidas byw select right here in the Galen green Philippines colorway one of my favorite hoop shoes to play in right now if you haven't seen my video on that link will be up here but that's it for today guys I appreciate each one of you guys for watching I'm signing out peace,2025-06-19 08:41:00.462342 UTC
Cc-KITETLl4,I'm Tim from tactics and this is the samba ADV from Adidas what up this Kyle from tactics board shop today we are wear testing the samb ADV from medida skateboarding so I've been skating these for about 3 weeks now and uh when I first got him I kind of had like a different like range of emotions I was really hyped on the look of the Tito it definitely felt a little stiff back here um in the heel area but in the the toe area was actually like pretty soft the sole was really stiff at first when I started wearing the shoe it was really tough and rigid but it it took only a couple sessions to really break it in so you could feel your board and feel comfortable doing flip tricks and and really just feeling your skateboard when I first put them on they were like really tight but I like it cuz my foot's narrow and if I compare it to any other shoe it would be the Dorado boost yeah these are the first first pair of Adidas that I've ever skated in definitely feel like I'm about to kick the soccer ball around with the boys when I'm wearing these yeah these shoes right out of the box super comfy they hug the arch of your foot um it almost feels like it was form for your foot the high heel cup here definitely holds your foot in super solid no chance you're going to be popping the heel out when these break in and pack out a little bit more so one thing I really liked about this shoe was I felt like it had a really good flick um despite having it's like a mainly a leather shoe right here um but this suede thing right here I feel like makes it skate just like a normal suede shoe my favorite thing about the shoe was the heel and how it was kind of more blocky and rigid and it actually made my heel flip tricks a lot easier I think my favorite thing about these though by far is definitely this like tongue it's super stitched down in there so like this thing doesn't move at all the entire time I skated I don't feel like I ever had to once like adjust my tongue which really bugs me about other shoes like especially uh I've been skating the match qus a lot lately and stuff like the tongue's just always getting sideways that always drives me nuts and this is like really nice really comfortable um that's another thing about these shoes is just for like walking around these were super super comfortable I really like the fit of these a lot um the insole in it is really thin but uh it is removable me get it out it's just a really thin kind of like basic insole same as you'll see in most Adidas shoes um but I don't jump down a ton of stuff but I did feel like you know things like me land Harden your heel definitely that heel absorbed a lot of impact and felt really good the cup sold these shoes felt really supportive even after breaking in so if you're trying to jump down things it'll offer you a lot of support so I've been skating these shoes for about 2 weeks and as you can see the stitching broke and we got a hole here when I first looked at the shoe and saw where the stitching was I was thinking that the leather would go all the way to the bottom and the suede was just sitting on top but it wasn't they're just kind of connected at the stitching and so when the stitching finally blew it just made a big old hole um I first started to notice it ripping after the first couple days but I do a lot of blackr tricks um we just do a lot of flip tricks when we're rolling around in the warehouse of tactics you can see that the laces are pretty high up but I still ended up breaking a few laces I broke a couple on the front and and then I broke a couple up here doing heel flips so I just tied this one a couple times but it wasn't too much of an issue all in all it's a pretty solid shoe definitely um you know I think you sacrifice a little bit of durability here with this kind of thing flopping down on you um but if you don't do just like constant flat ground all the time really good shoe to look into may feel like to skate a lot of Ledges maybe like to hit some rails jumping down stuff but aren't just like you know flat ground is your main game maybe look into something slightly more durable like the suu um but if you like just a little bit of heel protection really get you to look into for someone like me that's like really low impact I get a lot of transition uh it's maybe just a little thick for my preference I prefer you know maybe like the Lucas Premiere or like the match court but if you want that heal protection definitely a good option to look into with still having really good board feel here in kind of your 4 foot area once again guys this is Danny with tactics Board Shop here talking to you today about the Adidas Samba skate shoe if you have any comments or questions about these go ahead and leave them in the box below uh and if you want to pick up a pair for yourself go to tactics.com and they will hook you up,2025-06-19 08:41:00.531565 UTC
WjAFcVgkhf4,the Adidas Samba is known for its iconic design and popularity but getting the right fit can be a bit tricky especially with the way the sneaker is constructed first things first the sber generally runs true to size however they can feel a bit snug at first due to the leather upper don't worry they definitely stretch out and mul your feet over time in my personal experience I find sambers fit true to size for me I don't size up or down I just buy my true size however if you have wider feet you might want to go a half size up they're kind kind of narrow the extra space would help accommodate the width without compromising Comfort but remember that Breakin period's also going to help if you have wide feet I highly recommend using the official Adidas sizing charts to make sure you get the perfect fit for you which I have linked below sambers aren't cheap so it's worth double-checking the charts to save the hassle of returns especially if you're shopping online which let's be real most of us are also definitely consider the type of socks you're going to wear with your sambers thicker socks might require a bit more room so keep that in mind when choosing your size lacing techniques can massively affect the fit as well try different styles to find what feels best for you loose lacing works well for a relaxed fit or standard lacing gives you more support I have both loose lacing and standard lacing tutorials for the sambers on my channel if you need those so there you have it Adidas sambers run true to size remember Comfort is definitely key so take the time to find your perfect fit and check those size charts,2025-06-19 08:41:00.831423 UTC
Wwh1F2sei_Y,"so I pulled you guys on Twitter the other week and asked which is the better pair the Sambas or Gazels from Adidas And like there was an overwhelming like 75% that said the Sambas were the better shoe but I did actually have a pair here and I never showed you guys these So I wanted to show you guys a pair that I got Um shout out to Adidas for sponsoring the content over here And they did send me this pair by request cuz I actually again I've I've had these for months and I haven't done a video on these but I've it's been by intent I just haven't got around to it Anyway we have it here And this is the Sambas that I did get And they're different than the standard pair as you could see here So sambas typically are $100 from uh Adidas I'll link them in the description if you guys are interested to head over to Adidas website They literally have 20 plus colorways of sambas Like an insane insane insane amount I would say the cloud white core black gum colorway is by far just the most standard and the best one The one that I see literally everybody wearing males females it's the one Uh but I wanted to kind of branch out and and see what these other ones were So the one that I got is the Samba OG in this brown brown gum colorway And this is a premium pair that cost $140 instead of the the typical $100 The leather quality looks definitely elevated comparison You have a leather liner in here as well And these came with blue laces also So I wanted to lace one with each Honestly the brown laces I think look better The blue adds a little bit of pop but honestly I don't think it needs it I like the brown color they shoe with the brown gumsole As a description on their website 4.7 stars out of five with 1500 reviews is nuts Uh it says ""A dressy monochrome take on a classic samba with elegant brogue details I don't even know what brogue means Whether kicking it on the streets or stepping out in the evening these Adidas samba OG shoes deliver iconic style with a touch of sophistication Its legacy of indoor training shoes turn streetear icon continues to grow Crafted from premium leathers these shoes give a classic silhouette and elegant dressy look The smooth leather upper rubber outsole and leather lining provide durability and comfort for all day wear These shoes embody the lifestyle of creativity and individuality uh that Adidas Originals is known for Now unfortunately this colorway and the lighter color way is only available in lower sizes now But I mean that's the thing about the Adidas sambas like you look at their website and it's like yeah they they don't sell out They have a thousand of them but they have so many colorways that sell out and then they have a bunch of them that just have a couple odd sizes and then you have a couple of them that are available in all sizes So it's definitely one of those like shoes that they have a lot of offerings for and I like that they have them kind of evergreen Nike has their Air Force One white on whites It's always in stock The Sambas and the Gazels both I feel like are staples uh from the Adidas front that have been there for a while and a lot of people really enjoy what they're offering And I like this box too with the Adidas box It looks like it has little ventilation holes on the sides as well Um kind of a nice little feature Got to let the leather breathe So if you want a little history on the Adidas Samba this shoe was originally created in 1949 And it actually did feature the gumsole originally Um so football players can train on icy and hard grounds Now they literally have like 10 different versions of sambas The samba OGs are the ones that I focus on though here and they're usually made of a mix of suede and leathers I'm sure you've seen sambas on a bazillion different movies and they've also had like a thousand different collaborations with the samba including ones with Jonah Hill Atmos Disney Fel Human Race Sporty and Rich Sean Witherspoon Kith and so on So the sticking power and the selling power of the SA has proven to be something that we've seen a lot of and I think that especially in 2025 the lower profile sleeker look is still like the trend For summertime I feel like it's going to be the Sambas again based on all the replies that you guys were saying as well This color way though is a little bit different You could see obviously with the way that this shoe is put together it looks more like a dress shoe than a casual shoe And I kind of liked it Uh the fact that it has the all leather upper first of all instead of the the leather and suedes but you actually have extra little details in the leather extra stitching as well and then that jagged kind of tooth like finish on all of the panels I just thought it looked really cool Again it just reminds me kind of a nice pair of dress shoes So definitely a different vibe than a standard pair I do like the gums sole on the bottom as well And overall how do the Sambas fit for me they fit true to size but um they are a little bit narrow I I am a little bit of a wider foot in general so like I don't necessarily love shoes that are super narrow which is why I kind of stayed away from sambas and gazels primarily I mean I've covered on this channel a bazillion different pairs of Adidas shoes primarily Adidas Boost like the Ultra Boost just cuz I love the comfort side of things But there's a functionality to the Sambas and the Gazels And even though they have like a firmer midsole and stuff people prefer that sometimes over like a cushioned midsole It's just overall something that has more ground feel and just more standard traditional sort of feel overall And I feel like that's probably the reason why people come back to them over and over again But anyways have you guys tried a pair of sambas yet in 2025 are you guys more of a team gazelle uh or the superstars i like to see a nice resurgence in those as well I've seen a couple different colorways including the Bape colorway I almost bought those I really wanted to get them I should have bought a pair of them because the Bape one actually has the Bape Star on the side and on the superstar It's like a a play on a words I thought that was a really clever collab as well But Adidas is sneaky man They're coming up with some cool things And you know I've been reviewing Adidas for a long time and I haven't really reviewed SAS before So it's fun to be able to get a pair and show you guys them Shout out to Adidas for sending them over But I hope you guys have a good rest of the day Again if you guys want to buy a pair of Sombas link in the description It will take you to Adidas and you can shop through and and just see all of the different uh versions that they have cuz they have a ton of them It's definitely worth a look if you haven't been to their site and seen what they have available in a while But have a good one Hopefully see you back on the channel for some more sneaker content uh very soon All right",2025-06-19 08:41:00.832664 UTC
KEOC5sdhDbs,there may be no pair of shoes that's more instantly recognizable than the Adidas sambas these shoes were created all the way back in 1949 and had a thin Rubber Sole in order to give players more traction on hard and icy surfaces and since then the sambas have evolved over time for use in both Futsal and for playing in the street but they're also just a popular lifestyle shoe and a lot of people just buy them because of the way that they look but our Samba is actually good for playing football in that's exactly what we're going to be talking about in this video so I've had this pair of sambas for over four years as you can tell by all the wear and tear and they have seen quite a few games on my end I'm going to be covering the design the fit the durability as well as what they're actually like to play in and if you are interested in picking up a pair of these shoes I'll leave a link in the description where you can find them online so let's get straight into it by talking about the design of the sambas so as I mentioned these shoes have been around for over 70 years and the design for the most part has stayed the same every single year and what you're going to notice immediately with these shoes is they're going to have leather material all throughout the midfoot as well as the iconic three stripes of Adidas on both sides of the shoe and then you're going to finish it off with a suede toe box at the front of the shoe it's a really iconic design it stayed the same for so long and it really separates it from almost any other shoe in this category the sambas also have a traditional lacing system here that offers a lot of lockdown the laces are pretty casual I'd say they're wide and you know they're not as modern as you would find on a lot of other current indoor models you also have a pretty long tongue as well it takes a little bit of getting used to it first but after wearing them for just a few times you get used to having that extra material around the tongue and then stitched onto that tongue you're just going to have that classic Adidas Samba label as well you will notice in the lacing system here they have one hole that's a little bit beneath all of the others so if you do choose to feed your laces through that hole there it's going to give you a little bit more lockdown and it's going to pull both sides of the upper a little bit closer to your feet then moving on to the a gum rubber outsole it stayed pretty much the same since the boots Inception as well it's a little bit less than an inch thick and it stays roughly the same thickness all the way from the heel to the toe of the boot the outsole is really rigid throughout the heel as you would expect from most traditional football boots and it has a little bit more flexibility throughout the toe box as you can see there's a lot of texture and patterning on the outsole as well just to give the shoes a little bit more grip on those hard surfaces and that's pretty much it for the outside of the boot on the inside of the boot you have an insole that is non-removable but has held up pretty well over time and then you have some woven textile material that's also pretty comfortable and breathable for your feet now we've talked a little bit about the design let's move on to the fit of the sambas so I was a little bit concerned when I first got these shoes because I thought they appeared a little bit narrow when looking at them from the outside but even as a player with wide feet I actually found these shoes to be really comfortable granted I have had a really long time to break these in but I would typically wear a size 10 and a half Us in Nike and Adidas shoes and these in a 10 and a half fit me perfectly so I would say if you are looking to get a pair they do fit true to size and as I mentioned although the toe box does seem to taper slightly I find that it still offers enough space for my toes and I don't feel like I'm getting crushed at the front of the shoe and when I first started wearing these shoes and playing them regularly I also didn't notice getting any blisters in either the front of the shoe or the heel and the lockdown is also really great as is the case with any shoe that has a traditional lacing system whenever I'm going to be playing in a game or if I'm going to a training session I just make sure to tie the shoes relatively tight throughout the entire lacing system and then if I'm just wearing them casually I'll usually loosen them up considerably if you're not used to wearing a shoe with a tongue that's this extended it's probably going to take you a little bit to get used to but after a few days you'll hardly notice that it's there overall they hold up pretty well at a competitive level when you are playing indoor soccer or indoor football whatever you call it and they also hold up pretty well if you're just wearing them casually they don't feel too aggressive or tight or overly snug feet they just feel like a casual everyday sneaker when you have the laces adjusted to be a little bit looser and for that reason I think that the fit of these shoes is just really versatile so the next question would be what about the durability of these shoes how have they held up over time well in my opinion considering how much I've gotten the chance to actually wear these shoes and how many miles I put them through which is a lot I think that they've held up pretty well after wearing these shoes for over four years the only noticeable damage I would say is towards the inside of the heel here where you can see that the material has gotten a little bit scuffed and a few layers have been worn through you can also see that the heel of this shoe has been put out of place as well but the real reason for that is because I constantly put on these shoes without untying the laces and I end up just scuffing the heel by putting them on in a lazy way despite getting some damage to the material just on the heel liner here I don't really notice that when I'm wearing the shoes and it doesn't really have any impact on the comfort and then another area where I have noticed some wear and tear as well is just on the outsole here especially towards the heel you can see that a lot of that grip and texture has worn down here just by a few millimeters and you can actually tell that it has made this sole here a little bit thinner than the rest of the shoe just because it's worn at the heel over time but now that that's out of the way let's talk about some of the good things about the durability on this shoe first off the sole separation or should I say the lack of Soul separation when you look at these shoes the Suede and the leather towards the toe box and around the midfoot it's still completely intact with the rubber outsole pretty much just the same as the day I got them there's also been essentially no damage to the suede or leather itself I don't notice any cracking other than just the light fading and dirt that's accumulated on the shoes they're pretty much in the same condition as well since the day I got them I think that pretty much just speaks to the quality of the materials that Adidas has continued to use in the construction of these shoes but I'm just really happy because there's not that many shoes that I own that I can still comfortably wear after four years so now let's talk about the playability of the sambas and what they're actually like to use when you're Outdoors or on a court so for reference when I'm playing in the solos I'm usually going to be wearing them on the street so on asphalt or on a tennis court like material and I would say that the touch on the ball when you're wearing a sambos is really similar to that of wearing a leather football boot you get that really nice padded feel on the ball that you get with that natural leather construction overall they feel really responsive and fun to play in there's just a couple notes that I would have about areas that I would improve first off the lacing system is a little bit on the bulkier side the laces are a little bit bigger than on most other shoes and the fold over tongue is pretty long so I feel like occasionally it's just not that minimal and I wish there was just less going on throughout the centralized lacing system and this would just give me a better feel when I was just juggling or kicking the ball with the top of my foot also the gum sole here does feel pretty rigid and in my opinion I think it could actually be a little bit thinner just because in its current state it does feel a little bit on the bulkier side when you're trying to get quick turns in that being said the gum Sole still does offer plenty of grip especially after owning these boots for so long so finally what I actually recommend someone get a pair of the Adidas sambas well ultimately I would say that that depends on what you're looking for in your shoe if you want a leather shoe that's comfortable durable and also good for casual settings I would say you should go for them and I also think that a 90 price tag for a shoe of this quality is actually a pretty fair deal as well but if you're looking for something more modern minimal and light something like the Nike react gato might be more along the lines of what you want personally I just think that they're a great shoe to have in your locker because not only are they nice for playing in but they're also versatile and can be used for just wearing casually so that pretty much does it for this video let me know if you have a pair of these classic shoes and what you think of them thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next video,2025-06-19 08:41:01.428120 UTC
IHltoBT6Hqk,one of my favorite sneakers of all time is the adidas Samba classic why because it's a beautiful durable and versatile pair of shoes there's just something about these simple yet elegant design you have an all leather upper with the word Samba printed in gold on top of that there is a suede overlay knit decorates the toe portion of the body my favorite design feature of course is the gum rubber sole of the sneakers now I know people say they dislike the longer tongue on classic Samba but to me that's not that big of a hindrance you can simply adjust it to your preferred height it takes some tinkering but at the end of the day it's a simple fix in total all these design features deliver a beautiful and versatile sneaker that can be adorned with a variety of different outfits and styles the classic Samba like most of you use are very comfortable to wear you can walk in them most of the day but little to no discomfort let's not forget that these sneakers were designed with soccer in mind so it can handle some physical activity when it comes to it if you're wearing them as casual footwear like me they can definitely go the distance today I want to show you the shoes from an honest worn perspective as you can see here there is some scuffing here and there from everyday use but overall these shoes have held up very well all in all the Samba classic is well deserving of its name and status as a fashionable and stylish sneaker that has withstood the test of time decade after decade and it still remains as relevant today as it did in the past at the end of the day I think we all can agree that the adidas Samba is indeed with no pun intended a classic whether you get these sneakers or not that's up to you I'm just here to inform you from my perspective the consumers perspective let me know what your thoughts are in the comments and as always thanks for watching until next time I'm out if you're new to the channel and are interested in more content like this be sure to like subscribe or share the video click on the notification value to stay up to date as well thanks,2025-06-19 08:41:01.922927 UTC
e_disMbLMsQ,"Adidas sambas released for the first time ever in 1949 and designed by the founder himself of Adidas Adolf dasler it's been 74 or 75 years roughly since the release and this sneaker suddenly becomes a trend in 2023 what is so special about it so I'm going to share a lot of information related to this Adidas Samba unbox them review them genuinely help you decide if you should get this sneaker or not stay till the end because I'll be revealing the prices and what is the best price at which you can get this subscribe to the channel if you have not done yet because I keep dropping some regular sneaker videos I'm sure you don't want to miss that see you after this quick intro so going back in the history this sneaker was created actually by the founder himself Adolf dler in 1949 it was all black with the Brand's classic three stripes in white and a gum sole designed to enable soccer players to play on hard and icy surfaces but back then it wasn't Nam Samba or anything like that in fact in 1950 FIFA World Cup took place in Brazil and to step up the market game Adidas named the shoe Samba after a traditional Brazilian dance and music genre now fast forward to 2023 backed by meaningful collaborations and Renown celebrities like Frank Ocean Jonah Hill Bella Hadid and Kendall Jenner these people made the sambas even more appealing through their influence additionally these were also announced the sneer of the year in 2023 that surely pumped up the global acceptance so much so that sambas are high on demand high on Supply and it just isn't stopping multiple colorways and collaborations are hitting the shell and the pair is moving real fast in fact sambas are the second best selling design for Adidas selling over 35 million pairs till date this one that I'm showing in the video is Adidas Samba wegan and not Adidas Samba OG so there is going to be a difference in the material quality but this is just for representation purpose so please ignore that part now this sneaker's MRP is around 11,000 mark and it is almost available everywhere in India right from mintra tat click AIO naika limited edition Food Locker extra butter veg nonv and Super Kicks all are selling legit sambas but if you want a specific colorway or a collaboration that's not available in India you might have to get in touch with your plug who will Source this sneaker from abroad and you might have to pay anywhere between 15 to 20,000 for that specific colorway or collaboration Samba in fact some of the trusted resellers in India are selling this Adidas samb OG or samb wegan for anywhere between 8,000 to 9,000 that's a kickass deal but please beware while you deal with your reseller now as far as the review is concerned the sneaker is a very interesting looking clean pair with a white base some suede overlays around the toe and black stripes that represent Adidas you'll find a golden sambar written alongside the stripe the inner sole of the sneaker is pretty thin layer so it doesn't provide you any support and might get uncomfortable but I would recommend you to add some gel insole or a support insole to just add up to the cushioning level it's majorly made in Vietnam so nothing to worry about the quality aspect the outsole has a very good grip with these structures on the rear part and these air suction cups so I'm going to test the weight of the shoe just to to see how heavy or how light it is let me just remove all the stuffing inside and it is showing 0 g here it's right now 8 UK in my hand so I'm just going to keep this one shoe it's showing 280 G and that's actually a lightweight sneaker for a daily casual use overall I feel at this price point it's a must have sneaker if you're into collecting unique sneakers it gives you a good option to style up with baggy classic party outfits or just for casual outings seamlessly now a lot of people you'll see on the internet or in the sneaker industry say that this is the next Panda but I would differ here pandas actually had a very different run there were a specific colorway of a dunk silhouette whereas this is an OG silouette in itself by Adidas and stood the test of time and single-handedly beating Nike sneakers globally sambas will continue to remain classic for a very long time and will offer you that premium look no matter what if you're going for white sambas make sure that you keep them clean so that was a quick review of Adidas sambas I hope I have covered all the points I'll be mentioning more details in the description below so you should check check that out and I know I've come after a long time with this long format video but I'll be staying committed to this particular video format I've also dropped some viral shots in between please go and watch that on my channel and if you have not subscribed yet please do that we're aiming to build India's biggest YouTube channel and I need your support for that in fact Instagram P we have crossed 100,000 followers I'm leaving all the details in the description till my next video you guys stay fit and keep watching smart kicks",2025-06-19 08:41:02.009092 UTC
im9wNJ1KvkM,these shoes are probably older than your grandparents they were originally designed in 1949 and today they still cost a hundred dollars in this video we're gonna go over everything you need to know about the sambas and if they should be your next purchase in under five minutes I went with half size up not because that I read that they were too tight or anything like that they were just sold out in my size which is normally a nine but a half size up does indeed feel like a half size up a nine and a half measures at about 11 and a half inches for comparison my nine and a half Blazers measure in at 11 and a half inches from Heel To Toe that's like the entire thing not just what your foot fits in so just you know take that with a green song you know you know what I mean you feel me on that my size 9 Club c85s measure in at 11 and a half inches from Heel To Toe as well my hope is that you have one of those pairs of shoes and that will kind of give you a reference point on what to go off of but the Adidas website also has a handy size guide tool that I recommend you use so I would recommend going to true to size now I already know there's someone yelling at their screen saying don't go true to size if that's you comment why shouldn't someone go through the size and no these will not add any height to you sorry short Kings there isn't much of a break-in period with these and that's mainly because there isn't much of a soul these aren't something like Jordan 4's or Air Force Ones where it takes like a month before they even start to really feel like they break in I'd honestly say give it about a week and you should be good to go at least that's what the case was for me especially if you get one like this the all suede version compared to the regular leather there's a fairly good colorway selection with these but obviously the OG white with black stripes colorway seems to be the most popular right now and it's continuously sold out but luckily they are continuously restocking them if you want something like this mint green then the gazelles have way more colorways and they cost about the same these will set you back a cool 100 but honestly a lot of the colorways go on sale pretty often maybe not right now but like these I got them for 60 bucks on sale just like any other shoe just keep your eyes peeled and check back on the website regularly now one of the biggest indicators that these are growing in popularity is that the resale markets are actually starting to go over retail pricing even though this is a general release and you can get them on the website which means the demand is high it's not much over but it's about 105 to 108 dollars before tax and everything it's not much but it's still something so if you can't get them straight from retail Focus there it is surprisingly these are comfortable uh if if you look at it you're like Comfort wear but the best way I can put it is more comfortable than the kill shots more comfortable than the Blazers but less comfortable than the club c85s so somewhere in there you know you really won't have any problems walking around in these all day I've only had them for about a month now but I've done it like I don't know four or five times a bunch like you're actually walking around throughout the day too it's one area that I really haven't had any problems in not that I've had many problems with this shoe at all from what I've seen the shoe comes in either in all suede like this one with the leather stripes or basic finished leather variant which is essentially the basic leather that you know but if you want to shoot that's easy to clean definitely don't go with the suede go with the regular finish leather it'll save you a lot of time now normally I would tell you who these shoes are for but it'd probably be easier to tell you just who these shoes aren't for and even then I'm still having trouble with that the easiest way I can explain these is if they don't speak to you or you're not like dang I kind of want to try those from the get-go then don't even bother but I'm really having trouble on trying to come up with reasons why you shouldn't get these shoes the price is pretty good and that's really because it's such a versatile shoe you can style it preppy or you can go with street wear or somewhere in between that is I mean it's such a wide variety on how you can style this shoe overall it's a really great shoe and I think that's where it shines it's in its versatility on how you can style it and what it works with now I will say that it did take a little bit of trial and error to figure out what these shoes work with in my closet but once I did it is starting to feel like they go with everything after that it was just like oh I'm just put this on like yup that works if you first looked at these and you're like ah then I'll probably just stay away from them because I doubt that you would warm up to them afterwards unlike some shoes you know a lot of shoes you you're like hey yeah give them a shot and you actually end up liking them these I don't know if it'll quite go that way so I guess if you're trying to still find your own personal style or if you're really in this experimentation area these are a great direction to go all right I'll see you in the next,2025-06-19 08:41:02.694791 UTC
7_Du8E1kxgA,I'm an Adidas girl through and through and I have been slowly building my shoe collection I have a few pair of sambas and I recently got the gazelle and realized this fits a little bit different then I started looking at some of the spal Styles and thought if Adidas comes out with a drop of these that I want I need to know my size so in this video I'm going going to give you a comprehensive review on the fit and sizing between the samba gazelle and speal now everyone's feet are different of course and this is obviously going to be based on my experience with my foot so I am a very true to size size six I'd say 99% of the time my shoes are size six and very rarely do I need to stray away from this I think what's also important to mention that I don't think everyone thinks about is the shape of your foot my foot shape is an Egyptian foot which basically means that my toes slope downwards each toe is slightly shorter than the other toe there are other foot shapes such as the Roman foot the square foot and the Greek foot and depending on which shape of foot you have how your feet feel in the shape of the shoe is going to be different I'd say I have a pretty normal width foot definitely not narrow if anything it maybe leans a little bit more on the wide side all of this I think is important for you to know so when I go through the the fit and sizing of each shoe you know that it's based off of my foot template so starting with the ultimate OG the Adidas Samba for me these ones fit the best I would say these are very true to size they have the perfect amount of wiggle room for my toes they feel very kind of snug and secure around my foot but not too tight and the tongue is quite flexible as well this is the insole and you can see that they do not have any extra arch support so it's just a flat insole there's no extra cushioning there that's what it looks like so this insole is a little bit narrow I'm going to compare it to one that I love which is from my morale hiking boots you can see that the Adidas insult does not completely wrap around my foot it actually kind of stops right by my Arch the width is not really wide enough for the arch section of my foot you can see it doesn't really wrap around my Arch whereas with the morel insult you can see that it fully hugs my foot and wraps around that middle Arch part and the way that they made this shoe the insul is actually not flush with the side of the shoe so unless your foot is narrow and kind of neatly fits within the width of their insole you'll kind of feel it on the side of your arch compare this to my New Balance sneaker for example where the insole is completely flush with the side of the shoe so even if your foot is a bit wider than the inso you won't feel it against your arch because it's completely flush with the side of the shoe so here's a comparison of the Adidas insole and my Morel insole you can see how much wider the morel one is which is really great for me because it just fully hugs my foot feeling the side of the insole against the arch of my foot did feel annoying to me when I first got these and I actually just put in the morel insole instead and it completely solved the issue the back of the Adidas insoles are sticky but they're not exactly fully glued down so it's pretty easy to remove them and just put in one that you prefer instead the S has seven lace eyelids on either side of the shoe and I think that's kind of the perfect amount for me it just makes my foot feel really secure and snug in the shoe overall I'd say that the sambas fit the most true to size if you are in between sizes and you want a bit of a looser fit then I'd go up if you want a bit of a tighter fit I'd go down they fit great right out the box but if you have a little bit of wider feet I would suggest doing what I did which is just switching out the insole for a wider more comfortable one just so you don't feel the end of the insole kind of pressing against your arch moving on to the gazel these are the exact same length as the sambas even though they're the same length the overall feel of them is looser around the foot the tongue also is stiffer than on the samba I don't think it's made of leather like the rest of the shoe but it has a really cool unique texture design which I think is special to the gazelle style and the way that it's cut even though the tongue is a bit stiffer I don't feel it at all it doesn't bother me the gazelle insole actually does have arch support you can see that it has this little bit of padding right here in the arch otherwise it is the exact same length and width as the samba insole the only difference being it does have that extra padding in the arch like I said because these insoles are actually not quite wide enough for me at where my arch of the foot is this part kind of sits a bit weird like depending on the width of your foot the arch support might not actually be under your arch the gazelle also only has six eyelids on either side instead of seven like the samba so because it also has an overall looser fit and one less eyelet to get it to feel snug and secure the way that sambas do I do have to tie the laces quite a bit tighter so with these ones instead of replacing the Adidas inso I actually just put my Morel inso on top of the Adidas one and that gets them to fit the same way that the sambas do out of the box so in general these are true to size in terms of length they do feel more roomy around the foot but if you add an insole you can get them to feel the same way that the SAS do I would still stay true to size for these because you don't want the length to be any shorter you need that amount of wiggle room for your toes and if you do feel like it is a bit loose around your foot you can always throw an insole inside and get it to feel similar to the sambas and last we have the speals these ones definitely fit a bit longer you can see side by side with the samba that it is slightly longer and I know that it's longer because if I take out the insole and replace it with the morel one there's actually a little bit of gap between the insole and the toes because it's slightly bigger than the size 6 inso so for me because the regular size six fits a little bit long I just can't get these ones to fit right even if I tie the laces really tightly my heel is still lifting when I walk there's still too much room around my toes it just feels too long comfort-wise they're definitely the most cushy they not only have the arch support but they also have extra padding on the heel as well these ones also have seven lace eyelets like the samba and because the whole shoe is suede everything just feels very flexible and soft and cushy but because they're so cushy if you do have a little bit of a wider foot like me they might feel more kind of narrow and Tighter around the arch again this is something that can totally be solved by simply switching out the inso to one that you prefer what that won't do however is change the length so with with these ones I would say they do fit long and I would size down half a size and then I would switch out the insole with my own insole so that they would feel more comfortable around my width of foot and then again just comparing all the different insoles the samba the gazelle and the speal they're all exactly the same size they are the same width and they are the same length so I think when people say that one shoe fits more narrow than the other other there are factors like whether or not the inso has cushioning or what material the actual shoe is that play a roll in how tight it feels around your foot so in summary the SAS and gazel have a true to size length and the gazelle has an overall looser fit around the foot than the samba I would stay true to size for both of these Styles since the length is accurate and if the gazelle feels too loose you can always add an insole in there for a more snug fit even though the insole length is the same the speals seem to fit half a size longer than the other two it does have the most snug fit around your foot because it is the most cushioned I'd go half a size down since the regular size is too long and if you have a bit of a wider foot I would replace the insole with one that you prefer instead all right that's it hopefully you can take what I have shared and apply it to your width and shape of foot to figure out what size and what shoe style is best for you if you found the video helpful give it a like subscribe for more and I will see you in the next video bye,2025-06-19 08:41:02.730872 UTC
E2eWfl91gbI,these are the brand new Adidas Sambar Luxe golf shoes that I bought in the UK for £100 so in this video I'm going to let you know how they fit feel and how they perform but first of all in terms of the look and the style personally I'm a big fan of these they've got that classic 80s retro sambber look in fact were the Sambas actually from the ' 70s might have been from the ' 70s i'm pretty sure I've got a picture of my dad wearing a pair of sambers in the 80s riding a donkey in Benadorm legend status there dad you've got a lovely little bit of gold lettering there in the sambar now I've gone for the green with the lighter gum sole but there's actually quite a few options that you've got with these the little bit of rippling on the stitching at the heel you've got the suede tongue at the front which probably isn't going to be great for golf you're probably going to end up getting a few stains on those so definitely recommend spraying some protector spray on those if you've got it but either way I don't think that's necessarily going to save them and then you've got the classic longer tongue there again with the kind of rippled stitching on the tongue these look lovely if you're looking for a pair of casual shoes that you can absolutely wear off the course and maybe wear on the course as well then I think these are probably going to have you covered are they going to be the best golf shoes that you can wear absolutely not these are pretty casual spikeless outsole here has got a good amount of grip on it so I didn't have any problems wearing these off of the course and there is some element of traction that you're going to get on the course because you can see here you've got all these raised nubs going in different directions but they're not going to give you the most amount of traction in terms of sizing as with most Adidash shoes I find that I have to go up half a size and I did with these as well so usually in Nike or general shoe size I'm a nine a UK nine and in these I've gone UK 9 and a half i bought a size N and I had to swap them out they were just too tight on the end of my toes one other thing that you might want to know with these in terms of the fit is that they do have a slightly raised arch on the inside now I struggle with shoes that have too much of a high arch because although I've got a high instep it's quite shallow and so if a shoe has a high arch then actually it hurts my feet and my toes end up going numb and I can't deal with them with these I was worried that I was going to have that problem but after I wore them for the first time they were actually okay so yes I can certainly feel that they've got a slightly raised arch on the inside but it's not that pronounced in terms of the comfort of these shoes I've actually been really quite impressed there's not the greatest deal of padding around the heel and the ankle and there's no padding really on the tongue but I haven't had any blisters or rubbing or anything like that you've got I would say a regular amount of room in the toe box here it's not the widest toe box but it's not too narrow either it's just kind of regular feeling and I was a little bit worried that this higher tongue almost kind of like an exaggerated tongue if you see it there was going to give me some rubbing or cause me some issues but I'm pleased to say I haven't actually had any problems with this tongue it does feel a little bit weird compared to maybe other trainers because that is a high tongue but I didn't have any problems with it now if you want to keep up to date with the latest and best online golf deals then make sure you sign up to my free monthly golf deals newsletter i've included a link down in the description below in terms of comfort underfoot these are perfectly comfortable but they're not particularly comfortable there's no special foam in here you haven't got any Adidas boost or anything like that so if you're going to compare them to the more comfortable trainers that you can buy these are going to feel quite firm not a problem they're not uncomfortable to walk 18 holes in but they're certainly not the softest ride underfoot and in terms of using these for golf because they are golf shoes they've got not the greatest deal of kind of rigidity or stability to them there so yeah if you really really want a pair of high performance golf shoes that's not going to twist and rotate and is going to give you the absolute maximum in terms of stability and energy return then these aren't it however if you're looking for a casual looking and in my opinion quite stylish looking pair of golf shoes that you're easily going to be able to wear off the course and then wear on the course for a casual round or certainly down the range then I think the Sambas are going to have you covered if you like the look of these shoes I did my full waterproof test and I poured 100 ml of water over the upper on the toe as well as the bottom section of the tongue and as you can see here no water penetrated the upper although some water will get through on that tongue section so if you are going to be using these in really heavy wet conditions then your feet are probably going to get a little bit wet however with the look of these shoes and the fact that you've got this suede section on the toe box I don't think many people are really going to be using these shoes out in heavy wet conditions anyway i like the fact that these shoes have a leather upper on them as well and it is reasonably soft certainly not the softest leather I've ever felt but wearing them out on the course and wearing them out to work to be honest I've actually worn these as just casual trainers they have felt nice and comfortable above the toes so if you're thinking about buying a pair of these and I have included any affiliate links down in the description below overall I'm a big fan of the look and the style of these shoes and if you're looking for a casual pair of shoes that you can wear on the course if you want to then these are going to do the trick especially if you really like the look of them as much as I do would I wear these in a competition no absolutely not personally I want a golf shoe with a bit more structure a little bit more traction something I'm going to have a little bit more faith in so for example something like the Adidas Code Chaos so yes the Code Chaos is retailing for I think around30 more but you're getting much more comfort and softness under foot these are a real soft ride i'd say actually they're a slightly wider fit across the toe so you're getting a little bit more room in your shoe and if you look at the outsole of these two shoes well there's no comparison really the Code Chaos has got a far more aggressive traction system you've also got a TPU plate in the middle whereas on this you've just got a standard flat cup gum sole so in terms of spikeless performance out on the golf course there is no competition if that's what you're looking for I'd certainly recommend going for something a little bit more golf focused like the Code Chaos rather than the Sambas which are going to be a little bit more casual focused love to know what you think of these shoes down in the comments if you found this video helpful please tap the like and subscribe button and if you are interested in
